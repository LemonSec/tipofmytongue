5
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,320
you good to go

6
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,280
great welcome everyone thanks for

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,800
attending to this stream

8
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,879
some quick housekeeping we're strictly

9
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,719
keeping the time constraints here so if

10
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:45,760
you could please lodge

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,760
your questions through the app i'll be

12
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,360
moderating those and we'll hit them at

13
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:49,840
the end

14
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,440
or if there's something very pertinent

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,360
to the time i'll try actually interrupt

16
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,000
these guys

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,879
and ask the question then so now we have

18
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,160
two speakers from netskope

19
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,559
professor david furman and michael

20
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:01,280
ferguson

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,320
they're going to talk about something

22
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,080
which aligns quite well to my own

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,519
advisory approach

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,760
which is data centric approach to zero

25
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,640
trust

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,760
thank you guys great thank you well

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,520
welcome everyone thanks for um

28
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,000
coming to to hear a speak hopefully um

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,680
you know our intent is that you walk

30
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,400
away

31
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,000
from this session and you you think

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,360
about xero trust in a little bit of a

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,720
different way i want to dispel some

34
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,320
myths about zero trust and i want to

35
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,000
reinforce some very important points

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,920
about xero trust

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,000
um so look i'm david fairman i'm the cso

38
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,960
apac

39
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,240
cso for apac for netskope here i'm

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,920
also a partner in a venture capital fund

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,520
so i do a lot of work in the startup

42
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,520
and innovation community and i'm an

43
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,240
advisor to a number of different um

44
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,600
boards and and startup startup

45
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,399
companies prior to my role on my new

46
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,000
chapter i guess of my career

47
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,439
i was the chief security officer at nabs

48
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,119
i ran everything um cyber security

49
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,799
physical security financial crime for

50
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:57,360
nab

51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,479
prior to that group cso at rbc

52
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,680
out of new york and toronto by that ran

53
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,000
tech risk globally for jp morgan out of

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,880
new york

55
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,399
prior to that sea sofa rbs in the

56
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,038
americas

57
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,080
and emea in two different roles

58
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,000
i have michael ferguson here i'll let

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,520
michael

60
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,480
introduce himself

61
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,120
uh so my name is michael ferguson uh i'm

62
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,200
the cloud security specialist over at

63
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,280
netskope being at the company about four

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,400
years um

65
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,680
obviously working in that cloud

66
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,840
application space um but been in that

67
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,599
vendor land security vendor land space

68
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:36,000
for about

69
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,519
15 years now um working primarily on

70
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,400
web and dlp and cloud projects for large

71
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,680
enterprises across

72
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,519
australia and new zealand thanks michael

73
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,519
so look let's start and discuss what

74
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,920
xero trust is i think personally i think

75
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,160
everybody in this room is watching at

76
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,360
home

77
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,200
probably almost sick to death of the

78
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,720
term zero trust

79
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,000
it seems to be used extensively now i

80
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,239
tend to think it's a little bit misused

81
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,519
i want to rethink about xero trust in a

82
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:09,599
different way at netscope

83
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,239
we take a very data centric view and for

84
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,040
us

85
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,280
xero trust is more than just device or

86
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,239
end user

87
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,800
authentication and validation for us

88
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,280
it's about the ability to continuously

89
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,400
assess

90
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,159
the context of the session throughout

91
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,000
the entirety of the session

92
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,760
taking different data points assessing

93
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,840
them and taking action at certain points

94
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,560
in time

95
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,480
based on those changing conditions

96
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,640
one of these two points i want to make

97
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,040
as we as we dive into this conversation

98
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,400
because i think these two points are

99
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,000
really really important

100
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,760
in terms of understanding why we think

101
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,440
about it this way first is the network

102
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,080
conversion

103
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,599
we know that network traffic has moved

104
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,200
out of the data center we all know that

105
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,760
right we but we've got a very diverse

106
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,799
workforce

107
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,560
third-party environment third-party

108
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,799
network environment

109
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,280
and the cloud the digital transformation

110
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,080
has really changed

111
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,080
the way that network traffic flows

112
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,840
period right we have

113
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,400
remote offices we have satellite offices

114
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,000
branch offices we still have our

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,599
corporate networks we have mobile users

116
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,360
we have contractors all using

117
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,640
their own devices or separate devices

118
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,560
that makes it very hard for us as

119
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,399
security practitioners to think about

120
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,160
how do we control that

121
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,560
flow of data across all those different

122
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,360
permutations

123
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,680
there's also the big thing that we can't

124
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,520
ignore which is the data explosion

125
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,040
right so we know it's predicted that in

126
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,600
2025

127
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,680
it's expected to have we're expected a

128
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,759
3.5 x

129
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,199
times or 3.5 x increase

130
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,440
in the amount of data that we have today

131
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,560
right it's massive

132
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,000
through digital transformation let's

133
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,759
talk about digital transformation why

134
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:48,400
did

135
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,160
organizations progress down the path of

136
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,840
digital transformation they did it for

137
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,560
two reasons

138
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,479
one they wanted to automate their

139
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:56,000
business take the human

140
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,639
being out of that process make it slick

141
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,040
and

142
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,639
fast and automated but two once they had

143
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,120
that once they digitize their operations

144
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,680
they had this true value creation asset

145
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,479
data

146
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,560
from that data they can extract value

147
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,039
they can figure out how do they

148
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,199
drive smarter business decisions how do

149
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,639
they operate their business in a smarter

150
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,160
way how do they drive

151
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,360
market share and share of wallets

152
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,039
how do they create value for the

153
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,560
customer so that's it

154
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,960
data today is truly the true value

155
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,039
creation of an organization

156
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,440
that's why we really think about why we

157
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,600
need to take a data centric approach

158
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,639
to security and zero trust because

159
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,440
that's the

160
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,199
asset that we are trying to protect

161
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
so with the cloud migration that's

162
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,199
happened to support

163
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,840
digital transformation with our data now

164
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,759
no longer in the data center and sitting

165
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,360
up in these sas applications and in

166
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,880
these cloud environments

167
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,039
the new attack surface has emerged we

168
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,880
used to try and control data

169
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,639
through our endpoints that we managed

170
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,639
through the network that we managed

171
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,240
those control surfaces have changed

172
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,639
they're gone now we have to think about

173
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,680
the the control surfaces now the data

174
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,600
the sas or the cloud-based applications

175
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,880
or services

176
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,039
and the identity itself so we need to

177
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,240
think about each one of them

178
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,080
including the data and understand the

179
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,440
context of that data

180
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,360
so we know how well we need to protect

181
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,560
it that's why we have a data

182
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,919
classification scheme

183
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,520
that's why in all good security

184
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,199
practices you classify your data you

185
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:25,840
want it to

186
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,080
protect your most important assets

187
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,720
so in netsco we think about zero trust

188
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,520
in a

189
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,199
in a bit of a different way we the

190
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,759
analogy we like to use is the human body

191
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,840
right so we think of the brain the brain

192
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,280
is about how do we protect that

193
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,120
important asset how do we protect that

194
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,000
data

195
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,199
we use the central nervous system to

196
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,880
implement the controls or take the

197
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,400
actions it needs so think

198
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,840
i'll give you an analogy think of

199
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,400
a person walking along uh coming into

200
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,160
the kitchen putting their hand on a hot

201
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,720
plate

202
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,520
right you've been cooking hot plate the

203
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,240
control

204
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,039
or the sensor sends a signal to the

205
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:05,440
brain

206
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,599
brain goes out so that's really bad do

207
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:08,720
something

208
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,160
and you move your hand that's what it's

209
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,240
instantaneous it's in real time

210
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,080
right that's how we need to start

211
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,520
thinking about protecting our important

212
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,080
assets

213
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,840
once you see a change in the environment

214
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,759
once you see that pain and that point in

215
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,680
time throughout that transaction

216
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,639
take an action

217
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,840
and if you think about what tesla did to

218
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:28,639
the way it

219
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,400
revolutionized the motor vehicle

220
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,479
industry it's exactly the same thing we

221
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,080
used to build cards

222
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,599
with fixed devices with fixed components

223
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:39,360
and we used to take them in every six

224
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,120
months or every 10 000 k's to get

225
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,840
service

226
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,919
we did that so it could optimize its

227
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,599
performance could optimize the

228
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,039
experience for the driver

229
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,400
and you could maintain it in a world

230
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,560
condition well

231
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,120
what tesla did is it now takes data

232
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,800
points from

233
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,319
thousands of different data points and

234
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,479
different components throughout the

235
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,199
running of that vehicle and it adjusts

236
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,720
the experience it adjusts the

237
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,039
performance and it makes changes

238
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,280
to how that car operates at that point

239
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,360
in time based on what it's experiencing

240
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,879
makes sense that we try to do the same

241
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,879
thing around protecting our data do it

242
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,319
at that point in time

243
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,599
based on what we're seeing with what

244
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,479
we're experiencing

245
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,919
so we spoke about that growth of data

246
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,080
right we know that organizations are

247
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,400
creating data at a pace they can't keep

248
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,840
up with getting their hands around it

249
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,680
i've been there with multiple banks

250
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,599
trying to roll out data governance

251
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,760
programs data protection programs

252
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,640
how do you really you know and we go out

253
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,120
we

254
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,200
we allocate data owners and we have data

255
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,640
custodians and they have to go out and

256
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,159
they have to classify their data

257
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,480
we know that's really hard to do right

258
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,839
it is and however

259
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,360
how much of it actually gets done

260
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,200
properly how do you keep it real

261
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,640
it needs to be in real time because that

262
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,800
data changes one minute it was a public

263
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
it was a internal only document you know

264
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,160
it's a confidential document

265
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,680
how does that go and get updated right

266
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,279
so you need to think about

267
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,760
that that that process how do we do that

268
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,880
more efficiently

269
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,480
we can't keep throwing people at the

270
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,959
problem expecting them to be able to

271
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,200
maintain this and do that it's expensive

272
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,160
it's slow

273
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,399
and it doesn't work we've been there so

274
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:13,920
what you need is you need a brain that

275
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,040
does that for you in an

276
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,680
automated fashion you need a brain that

277
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,399
can

278
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,000
intercept that data inspect that data

279
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,080
and automatically classify that for you

280
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,040
based on

281
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,800
some guard rails and some governance

282
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,760
rules that you create

283
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,920
then off the back of that we want to be

284
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,440
able to say now that we understand the

285
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,080
criticality of this most important asset

286
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,680
this value creation asset for the

287
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,839
organization we want to make sure that

288
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,519
we control that based on the environment

289
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,120
in which it's operating

290
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,640
this is where the sassy comes in and

291
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,160
michael's going to talk about sassy

292
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,519
in a minute for those of you who aren't

293
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,200
familiar with sassy

294
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,839
sashi is secure access service edge and

295
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:52,480
really what

296
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,399
sashi is about and mark will do a much

297
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,519
better uh

298
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,720
um explanation than me this is about

299
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,120
moving the controls that we've normally

300
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,079
had within the

301
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:03,600
within our environment that we've been

302
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,760
able to control on those managed devices

303
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,000
within the data center moving those

304
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,279
traditional controls

305
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,200
moving them to the cloud why we want to

306
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,560
move them to the cloud we want to move

307
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,240
them closer to the data which is where

308
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,320
we know the data is now residing

309
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
makes sense right we know that the best

310
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,160
defenses is to get your controls as

311
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,680
close to the asset you need so we're

312
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,880
just doing the same thing

313
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,000
that's what we used to do when it was in

314
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
the data center the data was in the data

315
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,360
center our controls are in the data

316
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:27,839
center

317
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,200
so what we need to do is take those

318
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,200
controls and move them to the cloud

319
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,240
that's what sassy is

320
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,839
context with the right platform and the

321
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,600
right underlying architecture that right

322
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,200
sassy architecture

323
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,680
you should be able to if you think of it

324
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,800
if you

325
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,920
think about it and implement it

326
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,519
correctly you want to make sure that

327
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,800
you've got

328
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,760
you know a huge amount of visibility you

329
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,959
need to be able to

330
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,839
drill into what that user is doing to

331
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,320
that data if you think about

332
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,000
cloud applications and mic will go into

333
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,600
this in a minute it's really an

334
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,839
end user connecting to an application

335
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,600
because they want to access that data

336
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,480
and from a sas perspective you know

337
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,000
they're sending commands to that

338
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,920
application to manipulate that data

339
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,480
they're doing upload download delete

340
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,000
you need to be able to get that level of

341
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,519
visibility you need to be able to

342
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,120
understand the instance of that cloud

343
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,320
service that you're using

344
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,880
you need to understand the risk of the

345
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,560
risk of the application we spoke about

346
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,519
that changing

347
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,360
control surface the control surface

348
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,800
these days

349
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,839
is the data the identity or the

350
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:32,720
individual

351
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,160
the application and the data

352
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,760
you want to be able to understand user

353
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,640
behavior not just at the point of time

354
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,480
of authentication for the system but

355
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,640
throughout the entirety of the session

356
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,760
what are they doing are they doing

357
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,040
something that they wouldn't normally do

358
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,839
is this right

359
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,079
amongst when i compare them to the peer

360
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,760
group what does that look like because

361
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,360
we know that insider threat

362
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,279
is a challenge today you need to be

363
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,399
thinking about how do you build all

364
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,000
these requirements inside a threat

365
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,040
program it's

366
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,720
one of those requirements into this

367
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,079
overall architecture you want to be able

368
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:05,120
to support it from the one platform

369
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,560
you want to have you want to be able to

370
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,079
understand what that user is doing i

371
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,200
spoke about the

372
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,480
you know are they uploading downloading

373
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,320
are they transferring deleting creating

374
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:14,800
you want

375
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,880
you want to be able to control what that

376
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,079
user does

377
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,600
to that data to at the command level

378
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,360
right not just you can access this

379
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,120
application or you can access this

380
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:25,760
instance

381
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,000
you want fine grained access control you

382
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,279
want to know if

383
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,839
a user is going to a production instance

384
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,760
of an is application

385
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,279
and trying to shut that down and they're

386
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,800
not authorized to do that you want to be

387
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,959
able to block that shutdown that reboot

388
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,800
you want to be able to apply that level

389
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,639
of granularity

390
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,680
at that point in time now remember

391
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,440
when we started i mentioned the fact

392
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,760
that this was a continuous

393
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,120
approach throughout the entirety of the

394
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,279
session so the way we think about it we

395
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,279
think of data at the heart

396
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,320
we think about all these

397
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,680
sensors and data points which are

398
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,200
presented to us through the controls

399
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,959
that we deployed

400
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,639
and we look at that continuously

401
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,240
throughout that session we

402
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,880
feed those data all those data points

403
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,440
into a risk engine and we apply control

404
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:18,079
dynamically continuously adaptively

405
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,320
michael hand over here to talk about the

406
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,160
architecture okay this is what always

407
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,920
happens he creates a problem and

408
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,320
asks me to find the solution to it so

409
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,519
the government's been laid down we've

410
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:28,800
got these strategies what we're trying

411
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,120
to

412
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,320
achieve within zero trust but that

413
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,440
simplify the problem

414
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,680
ultimately there's our users connecting

415
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,040
to our applications

416
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,880
this has always been the case we used to

417
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,399
build networks and have everything

418
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,920
inside the data center

419
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
so that our users would have continuous

420
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,279
connection from

421
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,320
the from the

422
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
their device to their applications so

423
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,800
they had continuous access to the data

424
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,000
so they could process that data we

425
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,839
needed to make sure that it was

426
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,440
conf you know remain confidential and

427
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,680
its integrity was intact

428
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,839
the problem is that now the applications

429
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:02,880
themselves

430
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,680
have evolved so that we have taken some

431
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,600
of those applications from

432
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,920
inside the data center and moved them up

433
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,839
into infrastructure as a service

434
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:12,639
platforms

435
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,399
containerized we have some control over

436
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,760
it it could be software that we've

437
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,120
developed ourselves it could be third

438
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,680
parties

439
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,519
we've installed but they're now inside

440
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,760
of aws or azure

441
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,519
we then got some of those applications

442
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,240
that are entirely hosted third parties

443
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,639
the sas applications those are it have

444
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,000
installed those that the business

445
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,560
has started to connect to for the

446
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,639
different business areas so they can

447
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,240
gain some of those benefits in fact i

448
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,680
think it's now about 50

449
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,600
of your applications i think that's

450
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,120
pretty conservative are now

451
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,959
pure sas plays housing your data

452
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,720
then the users themselves have also

453
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,560
changed and are very geographically

454
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,519
dispersed

455
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,279
we still have some despite covert

456
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,040
working inside of our headquarters

457
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,600
some in branch offices um we've got some

458
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,959
of those that are now working outside

459
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,160
the network working from home

460
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,079
on managed devices some that will be

461
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,480
working from home on unmanaged devices

462
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,800
on soes then we'll have those that are

463
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,079
purely byd

464
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,399
and even contractual users who are

465
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,000
connecting to our data

466
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,199
that's important to know that one of

467
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,360
these users these contractors

468
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,279
have to connect to our data and buy that

469
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,279
application so the application is like

470
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,199
the gateway to our data so

471
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,320
what we're starting to see is this whole

472
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,360
range of communication streams from this

473
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,120
wide variety of users

474
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,079
to this wide variety of applications and

475
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,000
it becomes very messy and we're going to

476
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,959
lose sight of this

477
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,320
so what we've started to do and what

478
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,079
i've been doing last 15 years of my

479
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:36,880
career

480
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,160
is going to you and saying what we need

481
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,440
to do is plug this hole in this leaky

482
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,160
bucket

483
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,759
by giving you a technology that

484
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,240
hopefully can deliver a control

485
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,519
we have firewalls in the network so we

486
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,199
can get visibility at certain levels

487
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:49,680
we're going to

488
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,440
put in secure web gateway so we can

489
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,120
prevent the web traffic

490
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,279
that we don't want now we've got our

491
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,279
applications are sitting outside so

492
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,199
our users are outside so we need cosby

493
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,720
capabilities to understand what the

494
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,320
cloud apps are

495
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,160
but the problem with this distributed

496
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,600
set of inspection

497
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,800
and policy enforcement points is they're

498
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,000
disconnected

499
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,240
they're going to get duplicate policies

500
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,759
you're going to have gaps in those

501
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,440
policies so things are going to continue

502
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,480
to be missed

503
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,800
and most importantly today's point is

504
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,560
none of them are communicating with each

505
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,160
other effectively you have to use a

506
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,000
third party potentially and then a human

507
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,440
being to go and try and

508
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,600
understand where the risk might be and

509
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,199
then try to manually

510
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:30,720
change those policies and let me just

511
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,639
say one thing in that environment what

512
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,480
do you do as a security

513
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,079
leader you know somebody who runs a

514
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,680
security function you build

515
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,240
a team of people who are trying to

516
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,079
stitch these controls together

517
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,920
but your job as building a security

518
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,240
function is taking all these different

519
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,000
components it's a jigsaw puzzle you take

520
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:48,959
all these jigs will

521
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,800
all these components together figure out

522
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,480
how that maps tie it together with

523
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,160
processed and skilled people

524
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,240
but it becomes complex and it becomes

525
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,639
hard to sync those policies together it

526
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,120
becomes

527
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,120
hard to manage and it becomes resource

528
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,440
intensive

529
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,599
so what we need to do is try to simplify

530
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,039
this particular problem

531
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,599
i think the easiest way to do this is to

532
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,240
create

533
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,520
a centralized inspection and

534
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,839
policy enforcement point and we're going

535
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,520
to have to do that in the cloud because

536
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:17,919
as

537
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,280
as we've said our data is in the cloud

538
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,880
we've got to put those controls closest

539
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,400
to our data

540
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,280
and you know we're going to stream or

541
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:25,919
steer

542
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,839
all of the traffic from all of those

543
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,440
users whether they are in the office

544
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,320
branch

545
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,440
or working from home or even contractors

546
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,840
all that data has to go through we're

547
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,520
actually kind of fortunate we've got a

548
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,960
good starting point here

549
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,320
in the fact that the vast majority of

550
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,400
this into this traffic this application

551
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,280
connectivity

552
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,200
is delivered over the internet so we've

553
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,799
got a control in place

554
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,400
it just has to evolve the secure web

555
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,440
gateway is our connective tissue between

556
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,240
our users

557
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,240
and the internet but at the moment we

558
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,760
need it to understand that it's not just

559
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,919
websites i think it's about 85 to 95

560
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,160
of your internet pipe is now being used

561
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,840
and consumed to connect to your critical

562
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,760
business services

563
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,400
services the sas certifications so it's

564
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,919
important that we then go well

565
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,760
it has to understand that this is a yeah

566
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,440
the cosby has to be involved within that

567
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,520
and built in on the same platform

568
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,960
that means it has to have a library of

569
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,080
cloud applications so that we can

570
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,520
understand what applications my users

571
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,320
are accessing

572
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,400
and which one carry a higher risk to the

573
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,360
organization

574
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,880
maybe i want to put in place coaching to

575
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,039
say that when my users are accessing

576
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,120
a riskier application i'm going to steer

577
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,720
them and provide coaching and guard

578
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,280
rails

579
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,720
to using the sanctioned applications

580
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,559
maybe they just don't know there's so

581
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,120
much choice

582
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,480
that they need to know it needs to

583
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,400
understand thousands tens of thousands

584
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,440
of applications

585
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,720
there are hundreds of thousands of

586
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,320
different applications out there and

587
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,280
they can

588
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,120
continue to be created to create niche

589
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,400
capabilities for the different

590
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,840
departments in your organizations they

591
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,440
make you competitive but they are not

592
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,320
always

593
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,480
built the same you need to understand

594
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,559
where those gaps are

595
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,400
and then secondly we need to understand

596
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,000
the language of

597
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,080
these cloud applications they operate

598
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,600
over a different language to the old

599
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,559
websites

600
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,960
we do special interesting things inside

601
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,080
these applications

602
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:07,280
we can move create rename we can

603
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,039
approve marketing campaigns in

604
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,120
surveymonkey and marketo we can

605
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,600
shut down reboot servers inside of aws

606
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,720
at the click of a button inside of a

607
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,360
browser

608
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,039
that is delivered by the language of

609
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,880
apis and json

610
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,000
so this entity this centralized

611
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,240
inspection point has to understand and

612
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,400
have visibility over those apis

613
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,240
and json the other problem is that

614
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,080
whilst there are hundreds of thousands

615
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,600
of different applications

616
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,840
we're all using the same ones probably

617
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,520
hands up if anyone's using microsoft

618
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,640
office 365

619
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,440
aws or google suite probably a few of

620
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:41,919
you

621
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:45,200
and so that's so am i all three okay

622
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,520
so that's a problem if i send a share

623
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,280
link to one of your users and say hey

624
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,720
could you upload these

625
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:54,240
contractual uh documents to a one drive

626
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,320
okay there's one drive trust it no no

627
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,600
it's mike it's fergo's

628
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,039
onedrive it absolutely needs to

629
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,480
understand that the different instances

630
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,840
of those applications and apply

631
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,280
different policy sets to them

632
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,080
so again understanding that that

633
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,679
language of apis

634
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,080
and json becomes hypocritical on that

635
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,520
internet pipe

636
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,960
and of course because we are

637
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,360
transferring data from the user to

638
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,760
these applications having a very strong

639
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,240
dlp capability data protection

640
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,360
at its core allows us to say that

641
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,559
we can upload anything we want to our

642
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,159
corporate instance of onedrive or

643
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,240
sharepoint or google suite

644
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,440
but if some of the uploads and tax file

645
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,120
numbers medicare numbers

646
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,440
uh intellectual property we need to be

647
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,159
able to apply

648
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,840
multitude of enterprise-grade dlp

649
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,600
capabilities immediately to a

650
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,280
non-corporate instance

651
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,120
whether you just have visibility of that

652
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,400
or you put in place an enforcement

653
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,760
policy to prevent that

654
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,880
is really important and once we've got

655
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,919
this entity

656
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,320
there is a giving visibility across all

657
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,840
of these different applications maybe i

658
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,679
want to apply a different application

659
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,320
or different controls to or micro

660
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,120
services

661
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,360
to the center team so now i want to use

662
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,799
this internet pipe to connect my users

663
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,559
to my internal applications my private

664
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:07,440
applications

665
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,760
using a private access or xero trust

666
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,200
private access

667
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,520
and then i want to maybe say well i can

668
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,840
see all of these different connectivity

669
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,640
streams

670
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,120
between my users and my applications

671
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,159
maybe i can start to see all the

672
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,520
different weird activities that people

673
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:22,240
are doing

674
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,280
i'm going to apply some user and

675
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,799
behavioral analytics to this i'm going

676
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,159
to say well if

677
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,039
fogo starts to download 100 files from

678
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,159
the corporate instance

679
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,120
then uploads a 100 files to his personal

680
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,840
dropbox

681
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,640
or attempts to or attempts to or

682
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,559
attempts to it gets policy blocked

683
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,320
i'm really curious about that and i want

684
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,400
to be able to risk apply scores on those

685
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,760
individuals to determine

686
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,000
which ones are misbehaving which ones i

687
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,679
maybe need to keep an eye on

688
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,600
and if i'm doing that why not start to

689
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,120
apply some risk-based policies some

690
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,960
adaptive policies to say well

691
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,200
maybe if a user is behaving poorly

692
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,520
doing those sharing credentials in

693
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,120
salesforce with a colleague

694
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,960
maybe i want to actually prevent them

695
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,240
from then gaining access

696
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,159
internally to an internal private

697
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,760
application and i can do this because

698
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,039
they're all connected

699
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,840
inside this centralized inspection and

700
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,720
policy enforcement point

701
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,159
then i'll just apply additional

702
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,760
application applications to this

703
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,520
engine i want to say all ports and

704
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,280
protocols now i'm going to do a firewall

705
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,880
as a service in this cloud

706
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,960
i want to do remote browser isolation

707
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,440
i'm going to isolate particularly

708
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,320
risky websites and applications and i'm

709
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,039
going to have them

710
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,880
only be able to execute in an isolated

711
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,159
environment because i just don't trust

712
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,760
it yet the risk is too high

713
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,520
so these ones are going to go over there

714
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,960
and execute and i'll just determine

715
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,080
whether or not something actually

716
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,880
happens over there

717
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,440
and not on my desktop then i'm going to

718
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:43,919
have

719
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,679
integrated active access via sd-wan

720
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,440
so those branch offices don't have to

721
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,200
send all of that traffic back

722
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,799
through their headquarters and then back

723
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,880
out via this uh this engine

724
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,919
they could all be streamed to the

725
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,640
this cloud-based platform directly

726
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,840
and because of this all of this all

727
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,200
these different controls

728
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,559
and the connective tissue that we are

729
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,799
delivering for our users to our

730
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:11,840
applications

731
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,840
this platform this engine has to be

732
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,280
delivered on the world's

733
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,240
largest uh security private cloud it has

734
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,039
to have

735
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,520
data centers globally our our

736
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,360
applications are going to be global

737
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,960
you're going to be stored globally and

738
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,039
our users will start moving around again

739
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,240
or we're going to have offices in

740
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,919
different geographical locations

741
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,440
and we can't rely on that public

742
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,600
internet to connect us to those services

743
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,440
we are that network now so we have to be

744
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,720
built at scale

745
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,840
over um high performance systems

746
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,840
with dynamic routing smart routing so

747
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,159
that we get the best return trip times

748
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,720
and this can now be delivered with a

749
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,679
single

750
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,159
console single management consoles so i

751
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,840
could do policies in one place

752
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,200
for all of those different types of

753
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,400
applications we can be completely

754
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
agnostic as to whether or not it's sas

755
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,919
or a private application i can have

756
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,520
centralized reporting so i can

757
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,279
understand what risky applications and

758
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:04,720
behaviors people have been doing across

759
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,320
all of these different platforms

760
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,400
and most importantly you have a single

761
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,480
installation of a single agent a single

762
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,279
client

763
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,159
that steers all of this traffic through

764
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:14,480
to

765
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,520
this sassy platform and by doing that

766
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,039
you're going to see a reducing friction

767
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,559
from the business and the adoption of

768
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,120
this

769
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,960
we're going to see reduction of costs of

770
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,480
implementation

771
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,640
which of course will also continue to

772
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,440
reduce risks

773
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,320
so what we're starting to see here is

774
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,600
david fehrman's dream

775
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,559
of having this uh central nervous system

776
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:37,840
that is connected to all these different

777
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,600
parts of the anatomy of your

778
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,960
security ecosystem whether it's web

779
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,600
it's uh sas applications the devices

780
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,000
that people

781
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,600
want we're getting the visibility of all

782
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,520
of this we're generating a lot of

783
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,919
analytical information and data

784
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,000
that allows us to maybe start to put in

785
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,120
place some

786
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,279
continuous assessment and automation of

787
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,520
those policies

788
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,720
i actually think we can start to go a

789
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,559
little further than this

790
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,960
by taking in third-party information i

791
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,000
want to look at the other elements of

792
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,039
the ecosystem that

793
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,960
you know maybe that the sassy doesn't

794
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,720
deal with and i say well

795
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,480
maybe i'm taking the telemetry from an

796
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,080
email security engine

797
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,440
i want to know if somebody's been

798
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,080
targeted uh with more malware or has

799
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,360
failed security

800
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,200
the um security awareness training that

801
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,039
we get on the phishing education

802
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,960
that we deliver via email if that

803
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,559
happens maybe i don't trust that user to

804
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,799
be able to upload files anymore

805
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,720
maybe from an identity perspective i've

806
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,159
seen multiple failed logins

807
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,799
i said geo irregularities again it

808
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:35,760
contributes to the risk of the

809
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,679
individual at that point of transaction

810
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:39,919
i don't know what's happening here from

811
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,360
an endpoint perspective it could be an

812
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,559
unmanaged os

813
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,440
do i trust that device to download files

814
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:45,760
there's

815
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,200
certain things that we can you know we

816
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,120
can gain if we're all communicating

817
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,240
these different areas

818
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,960
to a single eyes inspection and policy

819
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,440
enforcement point

820
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,720
so i think that's what we're starting to

821
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,120
deliver on here similar to that tesla

822
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,080
uh the tesla analogy is saying well if

823
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,400
i've got sensors in each part of my

824
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,200
anatomy

825
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,600
in each part of this ecosystem i can

826
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,960
feed that telemetry

827
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,919
to ensure that when the tread comes off

828
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,760
the tires i can no longer go into small

829
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,400
sport mode i'm maintaining the ability

830
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:16,880
for my

831
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,640
users to get to where they need to

832
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,520
safely and securely

833
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,640
and this is what it would look like so

834
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,640
basically from every single inline

835
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,799
inspection

836
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,720
transaction we're going to continuously

837
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,120
evaluate all of those different parts

838
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,039
of the transaction all that contextual

839
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,240
information

840
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,799
is the data sensitive or not is the

841
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,960
identity valid

842
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,200
is the application of a certain risk to

843
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,720
my organization

844
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,880
is the endpoint patched and safe and

845
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,000
secure

846
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,679
and there's the previous behavior being

847
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,600
good and what networks are they coming

848
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,880
from the inside the network of the

849
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,159
outside and all this information

850
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,200
itself runs through a particular a risk

851
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,000
engine

852
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
to give us context as to whether or not

853
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,600
that particular transaction

854
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,760
is a risky and should be permitted

855
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,159
denied restricted from

856
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,840
doing what they were trying to do and

857
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,120
all that information can then be fed

858
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,919
back into

859
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,559
the next inspection the next transaction

860
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,039
to

861
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:13,120
gain greater context and again if we put

862
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,400
more telemetry into this

863
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,880
then we can hopefully start to uh gain

864
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,240
richer understanding of

865
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,919
the the risk of those third parties as

866
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,840
well so michael i want to dig into

867
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,919
application risk for a minute you talk

868
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,600
about building in

869
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,960
you know understanding the application

870
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,559
risk you want to explain a little bit

871
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,679
about

872
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,520
what that means and how that's

873
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,039
determined so

874
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,520
from netskope's perspective uh we have a

875
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,360
huge library of sas applications that's

876
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,880
just built into the platform

877
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,480
every time you go to a particular

878
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,799
application drive.google.com we're going

879
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,399
to know okay that's google drive

880
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,880
super easy but we are trying to provide

881
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,399
you with a quick easy

882
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,799
risk assessment of those applications to

883
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:51,520
hand

884
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,520
when what we do with that is we assess

885
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,799
these applications

886
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,240
regularly i think it's every month that

887
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,600
we're able to do we do a new release

888
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,559
every month

889
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,399
yeah new release every month of updated

890
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,559
apps uh and we give the quantifiable

891
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,279
risk score

892
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,960
one out of 100 and you can set a

893
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,399
benchmark if you wanted to

894
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,039
and say okay anything below 60 high risk

895
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:09,679
i'm going to

896
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,840
coach my users away they can still do it

897
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,919
but try and provide those guard rails

898
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,640
but the uh how we get to that point how

899
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,080
we get to the understanding of where the

900
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,960
risk might be

901
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,480
is we assess them using the cloud

902
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,480
security alliances cloud controls

903
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,760
metrics as a framework

904
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,279
a few other bits and pieces like

905
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,039
vulnerabilities and breaches that may

906
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,880
have occurred but what that means

907
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,399
is that we are providing you with the

908
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,480
information to say what standards does

909
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,240
that application adhere to

910
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,840
from a compliance perspective does it

911
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,520
hit pci dss

912
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,159
standards does it hit my hipaa and based

913
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,520
on your organization that might be

914
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,720
really important to you but we can go

915
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,000
above and beyond i think there's about

916
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,840
27 ish different categories

917
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,760
within that cci assessment that we do

918
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
for each every application

919
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,279
inside of our library and the library's

920
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,600
about 41 000 different applications at

921
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,200
this point it's always growing

922
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,760
as the ecosystem grows and we assess

923
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,200
them against each one of these and it

924
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,880
could be data protection does it encrypt

925
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,320
the data at rest in transit does it

926
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,360
segregate the data

927
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,399
does it do backups started my career

928
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,720
taking backup tapes out giving them to

929
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,760
iron mountain

930
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,120
now you look at how many applications

931
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,200
don't back up their data some don't need

932
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:15,520
to

933
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,360
but i'd like to know it's really

934
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,720
important to understand where the risk

935
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,240
might be in these sas applications

936
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,000
that marketing and hr and finance and

937
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,120
all the other areas of the business are

938
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,000
signing up to

939
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,080
so having that library of assessing the

940
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,679
risk of an application

941
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,080
becomes hyper critical and to deliver

942
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,919
this as part of that zero trust

943
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,960
um ecosystem and um engine

944
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,000
to protect the data in each in each

945
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,039
transaction very very powerful so let me

946
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,159
just take a minute and talk about that

947
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:43,120
because i think that's really really

948
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,480
important right so

949
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,960
we're not just with sassy seeing the

950
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,880
convergence of network and security

951
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,320
teams to come together because clearly

952
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,679
that that's evident by the sashi

953
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,120
platform right there's a security

954
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,399
element there's a net network

955
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:55,440
performance

956
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,360
element to that but what you've just

957
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,880
said about the application risk

958
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,120
element and being giving you very

959
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,799
regular updates and the fact that we

960
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,559
continue to monitor continually monitor

961
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,799
those applications we've got 41 40 odd

962
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,159
thousand whatever it is

963
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,120
applications in our library who sent

964
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,720
who's trying to stand up a third party

965
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,559
risk assessment process to manage

966
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,600
supply to manage supply chain risk

967
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,000
right extremely extremely difficult

968
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,520
you'll go out and assess those suppliers

969
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,039
once a year if you're lucky

970
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,159
you're probably doing a risk-based

971
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,600
approach you're going to look at the top

972
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:27,120
100 vendors if you're lucky and then

973
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,200
what are you doing about the rest

974
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,880
how do you go and you're probably

975
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,240
looking at the controls in those vendors

976
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,360
then you're trying to figure out do we

977
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,320
even going to go and look at the

978
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
application itself

979
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,520
think about how this platform

980
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,720
helps you step change your procurement

981
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,520
supply chain risk process now you'll be

982
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,000
now

983
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,159
this is bigger than just a security

984
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,120
discussion this

985
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,279
is a supply governance and procurement

986
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,159
discussion

987
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,840
right and how can you help them build

988
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,200
out their program

989
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,559
pretty important point so

990
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,000
let's try and look at some of these

991
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,519
examples of what this might actually

992
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,399
look like in the real world so

993
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,399
scenario one okay i've got a couple of

994
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,000
remote workers this might be quite

995
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,600
familiar for some of you

996
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,279
uh working from home but they're

997
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,600
accessing the same application

998
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,440
the difference is so the same ip address

999
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,880
the same hostname that's what they use

1000
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,399
to connect it's an internal application

1001
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,640
that's been developed in-house

1002
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,960
now the users are different as well

1003
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,360
there's they're different roles one is a

1004
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,360
user that has to operate and work on the

1005
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,120
application which is part of the

1006
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,559
daily process and the other one is a

1007
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:32,000
developer so they developers the

1008
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,360
developer has to have

1009
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,360
additional levels of access that needs

1010
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,279
to be able to access it from different

1011
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,440
ports to be able to get into the back

1012
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,640
end ssh

1013
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,640
and do some different uh different um

1014
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,240
controls and activities within the

1015
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,360
application

1016
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,200
so at the point of transaction i need to

1017
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,559
be able to understand

1018
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,120
what the user who the user is where the

1019
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,799
destination is what devices they're on

1020
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,000
where they're coming from

1021
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,240
and maybe how they're trying to access

1022
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,600
it the different ports

1023
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,760
to apply different controls to say that

1024
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,640
if

1025
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,640
the day-to-day user tries to access it

1026
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,679
via ssh

1027
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,640
they're not allowed to if the the

1028
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,159
developer tries to access it

1029
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,440
maybe they're allowed to but if they're

1030
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,880
outside the network maybe they're going

1031
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,000
to get a prompt

1032
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,440
by their identity provider to

1033
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,039
re-authenticate because they need to

1034
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:16,399
re-authenticate if they're gonna

1035
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:17,840
start messing around from outside of my

1036
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,080
network on my applications

1037
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,720
so it's the context of each individual

1038
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,600
point

1039
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,640
in that action to determine what the

1040
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,840
outcome will be

1041
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,200
scenario two again we've got two users

1042
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,279
accessing the same application

1043
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:37,919
and uploading the same document document

1044
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,760
that contains

1045
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,240
uh employment forms it's a folder

1046
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,440
they're trying to upload

1047
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,519
to their new cloud storage so the

1048
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:46,640
application's the same it's going to be

1049
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,240
one drive

1050
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,600
the difference is that one of those

1051
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,440
users logs into onedrive with their

1052
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,960
corporate account the other one logs in

1053
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,399
with their personal account

1054
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,200
they try to upload the same file we need

1055
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,000
to see

1056
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,919
all the different steps in that

1057
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,360
transaction all the different

1058
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,440
pieces to determine whether or not they

1059
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,120
should be allowed to upload that data to

1060
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,679
a

1061
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,399
corporate or a personal instance and

1062
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:08,960
obviously

1063
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,880
hopefully the upload of those documents

1064
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,080
to the personal instance

1065
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,600
will be blocked but can you just block

1066
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,600
that through the url

1067
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,080
well some of these applications the url

1068
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,679
is completely the same

1069
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,279
you know you can go to uh aws.amazon.com

1070
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,559
for every single one of you

1071
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,000
yeah drive.google.com surveymonkey

1072
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
all these applications the url can

1073
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
deliver you to the same application

1074
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,880
it is the api and the json strings

1075
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,120
inside of that communication

1076
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,320
that connection that allows this sassy

1077
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,039
entity

1078
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,200
hopefully to be able to determine what

1079
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,320
the instances

1080
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,159
and if i know the instance i know what

1081
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,840
the potential risk might be

1082
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,720
in comparing a corporate to a personal

1083
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,960
to a third party reseller

1084
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,880
professional service integrators all

1085
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,559
these guys have got

1086
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,640
using the same applications access by

1087
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,559
the same url but that api will be

1088
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:01,039
different

1089
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,399
and that's what we need to understand

1090
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,639
scenario three now if we've got users

1091
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,159
going to that that huge ecosystem of

1092
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,000
cloud applications that are available to

1093
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,520
them as long as they've got an internet

1094
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,480
connection

1095
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,399
we need to be able to determine what the

1096
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,800
risk might be to those applications

1097
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,879
so if my user is uploading to a cloud

1098
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:24,239
storage application

1099
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,800
uploading a document that is

1100
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,000
hyper-sensitive

1101
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,839
as i say we need to be able to determine

1102
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,199
what the risk might be of that

1103
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,159
application

1104
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:35,040
using that library of cloud applications

1105
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,800
using that quantifiable risk score

1106
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:37,599
potentially

1107
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:40,639
or even individual components of that

1108
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,440
library of that assessment to say if the

1109
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,480
application

1110
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,280
is of a higher risk i'm going to put a

1111
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,239
place a block

1112
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,639
or even maybe just a coaching page a

1113
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,760
guardrail to say

1114
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,239
hey did you know we have a sanctioned

1115
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,760
version of cloud storage that is

1116
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,480
available

1117
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,560
please use your onedrive use your g

1118
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,640
drive to perform this transaction so now

1119
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,920
it's complementing to your training

1120
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,040
awareness program

1121
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,839
exactly in line continuous education

1122
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,440
around the risk of cloud applications

1123
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,400
and this landscape

1124
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,400
that is occurring and what's kind of

1125
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,000
great about this scenario

1126
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,720
is we can put in place reports to say

1127
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,640
let's look at the last month of uploads

1128
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,400
to risky cloud applications

1129
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,520
and hopefully if we've got this

1130
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,760
educational coaching page in place

1131
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,480
we can start to see every day the fall

1132
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,920
of bytes uploaded

1133
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,839
to those risky applications because

1134
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,040
they're starting to become aware that

1135
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,000
there is an alternative

1136
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,400
out there

1137
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,640
okay well look hopefully that was

1138
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,040
enlightening informative that's how

1139
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,640
we're thinking about

1140
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,640
xero trust we don't see zero trust as a

1141
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,079
product as a vendor

1142
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,240
solution we see it as a framework that's

1143
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,320
part of an entire ecosystem that's why

1144
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,119
you need to

1145
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,960
understand some of those actions what's

1146
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,400
happening on the endpoint understanding

1147
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,280
some of the email elements

1148
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,480
look that's our story this is where

1149
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,480
we're taking our platform

1150
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,480
um we'd love to talk to any of you about

1151
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,000
it at um

1152
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,560
in greater detail please contact us at

1153
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,680
uh cso

1154
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,280
netscope.com if you have any questions

1155
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,720
thank you very much uh

1156
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,839
any questions

1157
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,440
this one on yep great so first question

1158
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,000
richard

1159
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
asks with the world's greatest sorry the

1160
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,839
world's largest private cloud providing

1161
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,079
the underlying infrastructure for this

1162
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,359
how much would the running cost be

1163
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,119
purely from a technology perspective for

1164
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,839
a typical org use case

1165
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,119
that's a really tough question because i

1166
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,160
need to understand the size of the

1167
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,920
organization number of users et cetera

1168
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,040
et cetera michael do you want to have a

1169
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,079
crack at that yeah

1170
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:38,640
don't talk uh obviously with this one

1171
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,520
right so

1172
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,880
ultimately the way that netscope

1173
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,880
operates is a subscription basis

1174
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,880
that end that platform the architecture

1175
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,320
that we put our

1176
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,480
services onto it just has to be a

1177
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,240
running cost to us like it's just part

1178
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,440
of it it's not like i can

1179
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,119
charge you to have this wonderfully

1180
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,359
paired network it's a subscription basis

1181
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:56,880
based on the number of users

1182
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:59,520
and those individual security outcomes

1183
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,560
that you're trying to get out of it

1184
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,280
whether it's

1185
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,960
different micro services that you're

1186
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,640
looking to get out of it and that what's

1187
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,760
great about that is that

1188
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,640
once you're connected to this huge cloud

1189
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,760
architecture of ours

1190
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,079
with those initial services that you're

1191
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:12,880
after

1192
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,440
once you start to go down that road you

1193
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,079
can go well

1194
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,359
maybe next month i want to have a

1195
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,200
different service as well i want to add

1196
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:19,680
on

1197
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,359
different capabilities to it you're

1198
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:22,880
already installed and running with the

1199
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,280
uh the service

1200
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,560
you touched on a point there around the

1201
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,800
peering do you want to talk about

1202
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,480
how paired we are yeah so what's kind of

1203
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,240
interesting is that if we're being this

1204
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,520
network as a service

1205
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,440
and your applications are hosted in all

1206
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,599
these different msps microsoft other

1207
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,960
centers aws

1208
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,520
it becomes really important that this

1209
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,119
service that we're delivering

1210
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:47,119
is connected to those applications

1211
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,119
directly and peered with them directly

1212
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,680
and hosted locally in the same locations

1213
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,480
as those

1214
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,320
so that you are never having to rely on

1215
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,320
the public internet to get your user

1216
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,640
to your data instead you hit the

1217
00:37:58,640 --> 00:37:59,359
netscope

1218
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:02,240
infrastructure and using our dynamic

1219
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,839
routing we can get you to wherever those

1220
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:04,880
applications are

1221
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,400
and through our peering we're able to

1222
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,000
get you to

1223
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,480
a direct handover to your data netscope

1224
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,320
is now actually the sixth most peered

1225
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:12,800
cloud

1226
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,640
network globally i don't mean cloud

1227
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:15,839
security

1228
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,200
network is like netflix facebook

1229
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,320
amazon and netscope and that's huge for

1230
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,480
delivering you the best connective

1231
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,520
uh connectivity and round trip time for

1232
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,560
access to your data and your

1233
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,960
applications cool

1234
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,599
uh matthew asks how does the structure

1235
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:35,440
of an organization need to change to

1236
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,960
support this very different security

1237
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,400
model great question with

1238
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,320
with a sort of lead on from that who's

1239
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,480
typically responsible for maintaining

1240
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,240
the implemented policies once you've

1241
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,320
changed yeah look that's i get asked

1242
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,520
that question a lot and

1243
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,680
i think every organization is different

1244
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,960
i touched on the point that we're seeing

1245
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,040
a convergence of network and security

1246
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,560
teams as a result of the

1247
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,920
cloud transformation and digital

1248
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,760
transformation that we're seeing sassy

1249
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,000
is bringing that to life

1250
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
i can't i can't tell you what the best

1251
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,760
model is i think it's very different on

1252
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,680
each organization and it will

1253
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,599
depend on the operating model defined

1254
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:09,200
within that organization

1255
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:12,079
some security teams take on the role of

1256
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,480
the policy and governor

1257
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,599
versus the operator of the controls some

1258
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,119
network teams are the operators of the

1259
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:20,880
controls and they're taking

1260
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,560
they're needing to meet the expectations

1261
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,000
of the security teams in other

1262
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,040
organizations

1263
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,440
security teams are defining the

1264
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,119
expectations and the standards and

1265
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:30,880
they're operating their own controls

1266
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,480
i've worked in organizations

1267
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,640
with varying different opera operating

1268
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,760
models

1269
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,400
i think it's a it's a journey for

1270
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,240
organizations

1271
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,560
typically what we are seeing ultimately

1272
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,359
is that

1273
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:46,079
the network teams are sort of

1274
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,400
implementing the network infrastructure

1275
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,560
but the security teams are still

1276
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,640
operating those controls those services

1277
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,040
so

1278
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,880
the network teams will under will own

1279
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,240
the underlying infrastructure but the

1280
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,920
security teams are

1281
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,599
defining the policies controlling the

1282
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,520
policies remember it's a single policy

1283
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,040
enforcement point that's pushing onto

1284
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,319
that call

1285
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,400
so we see that a lot but we are starting

1286
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,680
to see a convergence

1287
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,200
of those network and security teams in

1288
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,960
fact we've made the prediction that

1289
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,800
in five years time the traditional

1290
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,720
security execution teams

1291
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,640
will converge with network security

1292
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,160
teams cool

1293
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,920
so i think we we may have already cut

1294
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,520
off the stream but we might still be

1295
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,160
good

1296
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,839
so thank you very much gents there's a

1297
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,040
couple more questions that i'd actually

1298
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,319
posted but i'll take them up with you

1299
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:26,800
separately

1300
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,560
perfect thank you very much thank you

1301
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,040
very much

1302
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:39,839
mate thank you

1303
00:41:46,599 --> 00:41:49,599
just
