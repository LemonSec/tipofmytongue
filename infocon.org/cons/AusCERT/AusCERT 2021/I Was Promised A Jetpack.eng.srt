issues

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,840
first of all due to the time constraints

18
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,680
with the virtual stream which will cut

19
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,239
off

20
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:00,640
at the end of the uh allotted time

00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,559
please make sure you put your questions

22
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:03,359
through the app

23
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,438
i will moderate those and put them up at

24
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:06,960

39
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,880
so today i'm here to talk to you about

40
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,439
uh i was promised a jet pack

41
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,759
back in the day we had all sorts of

42
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,280
different promises of all this different

43
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,119
technology flying cars and all the rest

44
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:45,920
of it

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,159
and when we take that we line it up with

46
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,600
trust and security

47
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,079
and it really is an interesting

48
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,560
conversation to have on how we are

49
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,560
establishing trust overall

50
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,079
um next slide please

51
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,520
there we go so i have been okay

52
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,119
something wrong here that's not me could

53
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,239
we go to the next slide please

54
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,200
all right so i've been in security now

55
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,840
for the better part of about 30 years

56
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,920
um and along the lines i've had all

57
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,040
sorts of different roles

58
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,599
and i've learned a lot from all of this

59
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:26,800
as i've been going through

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,120
um sorry could i go to the next slide

61
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,480
please

62
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,360
and there we go okay so wait that's the

63
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,280
wrong picture again all right so

64
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,680
could we go one more there we go okay

65
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,120
good now we're talking

66
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,640
um i've been doing security one forward

67
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,800
over about 30 years now and i've had

68
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,640
all sorts of different roles from being

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,000
a firewall admin right through to being

70
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,599
a cso for a power company

71
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,000
and all points in between and i've made

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,760
a lot of mistakes in my career but it's

73
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,879
been very

74
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,280
interesting in what i have been able to

75
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,319
learn

76
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,480
and one of the things i learned is that

77
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,640
sometimes people that see themselves as

78
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,720
rock stars really need to have a proper

79
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,440
writer

80
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,040
go to the next slide please and so

81
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,720
in this particular case the rockstar

82
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,080
being my cat loki who

83
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,879
put on quite a show last year he was

84
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,480
really tired from hunting

85
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,239
rabbits through the window all day so he

86
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,640
will not be joining us today but

87
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,800
oh well uh if we could go to the next

88
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,000
slide please

89
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
so early on him you know when i was a

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,920
kid you know back in the 1970s

91
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,920
um in back of comic books they would

92
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,959
have these adverts

93
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,560
that would say you know if you send in

94
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,080
your money we'd send you these

95
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,360
x-ray specs and i was absolutely fat

96
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,000
like just

97
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,640
thought this was the most amazing idea i

98
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,680
was six

99
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,319
um and so i figured out how to get an

100
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,000
envelope and get to stamp and everything

101
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,720
and i wrote

102
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,040
my address on it and sent it on to the

103
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,400
company

104
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,159
and quite literally put a bunch of

105
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,760
change in the envelope because i was

106
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,280
absolutely wanted to have these x-ray

107
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,319
specs

108
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,159
imagine my disappointment when i got

109
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,360
them and it was just a piece of

110
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,360
cardboard with a hole in it

111
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,159
so right there we had an erosion of

112
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,920
trust right out of the gate

113
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,640
if we go to the next slide please and

114
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,560
then as i got older i thought

115
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,319
okay you know this would be a really

116
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,400
cool idea because you know i watch happy

117
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,239
days one too many times and grease and

118
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,200
all the rest of it

119
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,959
and i figured you know a switchblade

120
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,120
comb would be really really kind of neat

121
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,918
to have

122
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,479
so i sent away for that this time you

123
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,759
know my parents were good enough to help

124
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,960
me by sending a check

125
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,639
a little less painful than sending a

126
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,720
bunch of change but when i got it you

127
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,080
know it did one comb

128
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,680
two oh and it broke and again we had a

129
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,240
further erosion of trust

130
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,160
so we go to the next slide please

131
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,720
so promises were made back then you know

132
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,639
we were told that we would be all

133
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,520
living on the moon we'd have jet packs

134
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,520
we'd have flying cars

135
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,639
and it's really unfortunate that

136
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,360
this was how things were built up didn't

137
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,560
really align with where we are today

138
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,840
and we seem to be you know

139
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,720
really content to deal with what we have

140
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,479
as opposed to what we were promised next

141
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,039
slide please

142
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,199
and as a result we tend to battle with

143
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,880
ourselves about you know how we're going

144
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,479
to get things done and what

145
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,639
is you know the best way to get trust in

146
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,800
an organization build it from there

147
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,280
but we have to do better overall next

148
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,199
slide please

149
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,960
and i apologize to the person who's

150
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,520
doing the slide so there's a lot of them

151
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,160
so we never have to do a much better job

152
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,080
and you know around the world because of

153
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,240
the state of where we are now

154
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,160
we are dealing with remote workers as

155
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,840
far as the eye can see

156
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,840
there was a time where remote workers

157
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,039
were seen as

158
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,440
you know a convenience so a nice to have

159
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,560
you know something to

160
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,240
reward your employees with and now it

161
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,199
has become

162
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,120
really an effective tool in order to

163
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,520
make sure that business can continue

164
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,520
and as we transition back into the

165
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,039
office which you know a great deal of

166
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,120
that's happening in australia now

167
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,360
we have to realize that we have to be

168
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,240
able to have

169
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,720
resilience built in that we're prepared

170
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,400
for this in the future and we have to

171
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,479
foster trust with our end users

172
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,240
so that they understand how to do this

173
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,240
in the future you know they're very good

174
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,000
at what they're very good at they may be

175
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,680
in finance they may be in hr whatever it

176
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,639
happens to be

177
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,400
but they're not necessarily technically

178
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,319
savvy and we have to make sure that we

179
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,360
are giving them tools to help

180
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,960
democratize security

181
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,199
and you know that really does mean

182
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,880
making it as easy as possible for them

183
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,120
to do their job safely and securely

184
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,199
because you know we didn't give them the

185
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,560
jet pack

186
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,000
but we can give them the tools to make

187
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,160
sure they get the job done

188
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,759
that being said next slide please

189
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,199
my co-worker was good enough to point

190
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,919
out that yes there are jet packs now but

191
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,319
for some reason my boss wendy nather who

192
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,720
just got indicted indicted

193
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,240
inducted into the hall of fame for in uk

194
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,599
um pointed out that um yeah i can't

195
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,840
expense one of those yet

196
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,400
i'll say yeah that's my go-to all right

197
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,520
next slide please

198
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,440
so tools of the trade you know we want

199
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,160
to look at how we can do things better

200
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,400
and you know ways to authenticate users

201
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,639
is a great example of this because

202
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,199
we tend to rely on some controls that

203
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,560
are essentially deprecated like the

204
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,599
password

205
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,280
now the password has served its purpose

206
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,800
since about 1962

207
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,840
it has really done its job but so has

208
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,599
the house key to get in the front of our

209
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,400
you know abode a house key has limited

210
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,199
utility

211
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,199
the person who has it has the ability to

212
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,880
access the house

213
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,880
it doesn't mean that's the right person

214
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,000
that's supposed to be coming through the

215
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,039
front door

216
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,560
so we have to be really cognizant of

217
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,680
this that when we're dealing with

218
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,800
computer systems

219
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,520
that we understand that this is a bit of

220
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,039
a misstep and we've got to do a better

221
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:45,919
job

222
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,440
be it multi-factor authentication

223
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,360
biometrics or you know in the future

224
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,639
passwordless

225
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,960
there is a open standard called webauthn

226
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,120
that was penned by the w3c

227
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,160
which is a great example of

228
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,039
how we can get to past this is it to be

229
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,120
and all no but it's a great step forward

230
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,599
so

231
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,960
if you take nothing else away from this

232
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,280
talk today besides you know visiting my

233
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,319
colleagues in their booth today make

234
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,000
sure that you go find this document and

235
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,120
read it this is a

236
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,960
open standard this is not any sort of

237
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,560
vendor thing this is a

238
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,680
something that is freely available

239
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,440
so when we have the tools and we

240
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,960
understand that you know there are

241
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,639
better ways to do things we have to also

242
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,360
be aware

243
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,840
that the attackers are looking for ways

244
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,720
to cause trouble

245
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,520
next slide please

246
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,159
thank you so dark patterns in user

247
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,200
interface design

248
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,360
are one example of this so when we're

249
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,640
talking about that sort of thing it's

250
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:41,440
sort of

251
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,760
how they manipulate the interface so you

252
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,279
go to click the x in the top right

253
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,880
corner which you know most people say oh

254
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,480
that's how i close the window

255
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,080
meanwhile if it clicks it it pops up

256
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,519
another box saying are you sure you want

257
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,279
to do this yes or no and both of those

258
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,959
are the wrong answer

259
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,040
this is one of those issues that we have

260
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,000
to understand that

261
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,320
when that happens that is helping to

262
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,480
erode the trust of the user

263
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,680
because they don't know what to trust

264
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,440
and as security practitioners we have to

265
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,800
put the tools in place so they can

266
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,200
learn how to you know better trust uh

267
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,000
next slide please

268
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,680
so this is a great example from my

269
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,279
friend corey doctorow's twitter feed

270
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,600
where he took a screenshot of an ad that

271
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,200
popped up in his feed

272
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,560
and if you look there in the yellow

273
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:24,160
circle you'll see a little what looks

274
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,760
like a smudge

275
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,120
and he went to wipe it and thought it

276
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,880
was on his screen it turned out that was

277
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,760
actually

278
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,720
in the image itself which erroneously

279
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,560
got the individual to click

280
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,880
on the ad which is not something they

281
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,080
would have otherwise

282
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,680
done next slide please

283
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,519
so the attackers know this and they know

284
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,279
how to prey on what

285
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,160
would other our sensibilities you know

286
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,120
what we would

287
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,519
normally do they can mess with us in

288
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,240
many ways

289
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,760
they can do bait and switch they do

290
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,600
confirm shaming like the box that pops

291
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,880
up saying are you really sure you want

292
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,760
to do that

293
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,279
uh misdirection you know and trick

294
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,959
questions and things like that

295
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,800
where you're causing them to make

296
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,240
choices that

297
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,920
you know by all rights they wouldn't

298
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,000
normally make

299
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,800
next slide please

300
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,880
another example of this is messing with

301
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,279
colors on or tick boxes and things like

302
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,000
that

303
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,519
there was one application that i was

304
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,360
working on just two days ago

305
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,279
and when i went to click on the button

306
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,279
to enable a particular function the

307
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,160
application

308
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,680
because there was a bug in it it would

309
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,600
actually move the little check box to

310
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,640
the left

311
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,279
i was like okay that's different so i go

312
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,079
over to click

313
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,519
the box again and it would go back to

314
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,240
the right and this was most insidious

315
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,440
pain in the

316
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,000
posterior that i could think of and it

317
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,279
really caused me a great deal of

318
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,800
frustration but this was

319
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,200
just a mistake in the code and i was

320
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,240
able to figure out what

321
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,360
was going on but that sort of behavior

322
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,200
is something the attackers will use in

323
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,880
their malicious attempts to

324
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,959
gain access to your system to steal your

325
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,000
data

326
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
and this really does create anxiety for

327
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,680
the user because

328
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,440
let's be honest the vast majority of

329
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,360
users that are working remotely

330
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,200
or on computers in general are not

331
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,880
necessarily technically savvy

332
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,320
they know how to open excel they know

333
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,640
how to open their email they know how to

334
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,519
get things done

335
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,399
for their job but if you ask them to you

336
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,680
know switch from

337
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,920
an ethernet cable to a wi-fi or whatever

338
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,279
it happens to be something very what we

339
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,880
would take as being simple

340
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,800
this could cause them a great deal of

341
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,440
angst and we have to always be cognizant

342
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,880
of this that we are there

343
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,240
to enable them to get their jobs done

344
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,079
the goal really is quite simple we want

345
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,760
to make sure that security is done in a

346
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,240
way

347
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,920
that doesn't fracture their best

348
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,279
interest

349
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,200
next slide please so malicious design

350
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,440
is something that comes up a lot and

351
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,800
unfortunately a lot of times only a

352
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,399
designer will actually be able to spot

353
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,160
this sort of behavior

354
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,480
and when we have things like that and

355
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,000
then we contrast that

356
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,440
against you know applications are

357
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,360
written by engineers for engineers

358
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,519
this makes it very very difficult for

359
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,200
the end user to be able to

360
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,200
use their applications um

361
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,920
sorry flash back to my earlier days and

362
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,279
when they can't

363
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,120
figure out something because it is far

364
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,800
too difficult to use

365
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,040
they may make mistakes and the same can

366
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,639
be said a malicious design

367
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,639
in that people will make mistakes that

368
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,399
they wouldn't be able to

369
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,880
discern what was going on next slide

370
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,200
please

371
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,519
what it fundamentally boils down to is

372
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,880
we aren't able to trust ourselves

373
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,200
to make the right decisions many times

374
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,360
and that's not because we don't get it

375
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,519
it's because we are built to trust

376
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,200
we are expecting things to work a

377
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,600
certain way and unfortunately nefarious

378
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,320
types we'll prey on that

379
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,720
next slide is because we all have

380
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,880
some sort of bias no matter how we put

381
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,000
it we all have

382
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,639
our individual biases and we have to

383
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,839
make sure that

384
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,760
those biases are not causing us or

385
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,440
others undo harm

386
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,120
we always have to be cognizant of this

387
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,440
because not only does that affect the

388
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,720
individuals

389
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,480
who are interacting with their systems

390
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,600
but we also have to look at how bias

391
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,160
negatively impacts technology next slide

392
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,399
please

393
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,760
so here is an absolute fantastic example

394
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,880
amateur elizari

395
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,720
was talking about creating a bug bounty

396
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,959
for bad algorithms

397
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,839
that's an excellent idea and this is the

398
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,360
kind of thing that we have to start

399
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,160
looking at

400
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,680
you know i was you know very fortunate

401
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,920
to see a talk by mikko heppenen

402
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,279
and sorry mikko if i got your name

403
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,040
pronounced wrong um

404
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,880
who gave a talk a couple years ago when

405
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,240
we were able to you know

406
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,959
go out in public and he was talking

407
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:41,279
about

408
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,040
applications that were writing other

409
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,320
applications

410
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,560
and this was really amazing but if the

411
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,399
initial application has

412
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,120
a negative bias built into it that can

413
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,959
then replicate and

414
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,360
change in various nefarious ways as it

415
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,120
goes along

416
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,000
we need to be able to better understand

417
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,600
how we are affecting our environments

418
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,279
around us and this very much extends to

419
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,399
algorithms

420
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,360
uh next slide please

421
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,880
so we have to really pray on pray on

422
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,760
pay attention to the capabilities that

423
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,800
we are trying to do

424
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
because we don't want to have negative

425
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,279
impacts as we go along because

426
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,079
yes we do security but imagine we put on

427
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,279
a different hat

428
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,360
imagine we went into a different role

429
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,760
next slide please

430
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,000
now here's a story from 2011 about a

431
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:30,959
former security

432
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,760
expert that became or secure security

433
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,399
expert

434
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,480
who went in to become a developer and

435
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,320
started his own application

436
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,680
and one of the things that he found out

437
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,600
rather short order that

438
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,880
everything he had been talking about

439
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,720
from a security perspective when it came

440
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,399
down to writing his own application

441
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,160
he ended up you know making the same

442
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,560
mistakes

443
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,360
next slide please and there's other

444
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,040
things that we have to look at on how

445
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,480
attackers can cause us trouble

446
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:58,639
and one is the you know the subtlety of

447
00:14:58,639 --> 00:14:59,920
corrupting data

448
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,440
now we always worry about data being

449
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,120
stolen or data being you know

450
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,959
compromised in some fashion

451
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,560
but we don't tend to spend a lot of time

452
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,639
on data being altered

453
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,399
now this is a great example here where

454
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,480
emails that were leaked

455
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,920
ostensibly were tied back to this

456
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,320
particular journalist and it's made it

457
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,440
look like he was a

458
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,279
you know talking to the cia as an

459
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,279
example in the united states

460
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,959
this wasn't the case but this is an

461
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,399
example of what

462
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,800
looked like a data breach turned out to

463
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,199
be actually just absolutely false flag

464
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,959
and these are the kind of things that we

465
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:33,360
always have to be on the lookout because

466
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,199
this could really change the narrative

467
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,120
with just a few short words

468
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,199
next line please here's another example

469
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:41,680
here

470
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,480
where you know a story was changed where

471
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:44,800
it

472
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,800
absolutely altered the meaning by just

473
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,040
changing a few words in the text

474
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,720
this is the kind of thing where trust

475
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,440
again is further eroded

476
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,480
next slide please sorry

477
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,000
we have to be able to defend against

478
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
denial of trust attacks

479
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,759
and these are attacks against things

480
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,040
that we expect to be

481
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,519
correct be it a user interface be it

482
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,240
data

483
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,079
be it how an application should be

484
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,279
behaving

485
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,440
we have to be always aware of this

486
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,199
because we have a fiduciary

487
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:14,399
responsibility to protect our

488
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,639
organizations to protect our staff and

489
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,680
our data and if we are not there to

490
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,519
enable them to do things safely and

491
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,399
securely

492
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,800
then unfortunately this is going to have

493
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,759
you know unfortunate consequences

494
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:32,639
next up so in order for us to trust

495
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,120
in ourselves we have to learn how to

496
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,120
earn trust from others

497
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,720
now there's been a lot of conversation

498
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,040
over the years about what exactly trust

499
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,839
is and a lot of times it is like oh i

500
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:44,800
just trust them

501
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,519
well have you earned it have you

502
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,360
verified it have you gone through and

503
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,959
said yes this is okay

504
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,399
if you log into an application with the

505
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,560
username and password does that mean you

506
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,800
are trusted to use that application

507
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,279
that just means you had the house key so

508
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,959
we have to look at doing a more

509
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,040
you know concerted effort to secure

510
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,039
those devices secure those applications

511
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,000
and protect the data

512
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,439
next slide please and we're able to do

513
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,439
that by earning trust through various

514
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,319
steps you know being

515
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,240
honest with folks when things go wrong

516
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,079
coming out and saying clearly that this

517
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,599
is what happened our particular system

518
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,599
was breached for x y and z

519
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,359
and this is what happened and these are

520
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,000
the steps we're taking to remediate it

521
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,600
trying to pretend something didn't

522
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,840
happen or being disingenuous with the

523
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,640
information

524
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,480
again further erodes the trust in your

525
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,960
customers and whatever it happens to be

526
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,200
we have to be transparent we have to

527
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,160
make sure

528
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,080
that we are the adults in the room as

529
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,600
security practitioners as security

530
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,840
professionals

531
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:48,559
because we need to establish that trust

532
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,160
you know in the past we may have had the

533
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,919
concept of yes we are the flaming sword

534
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,360
of justice how do we get to the answer

535
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,039
of no

536
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,919
that's a deprecated notion we have to

537
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:58,400
show

538
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,760
predictability we have to show

539
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,080
capability and a willingness to

540
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,400
correct mistakes when we make them i

541
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,400
built a career on making mistakes as

542
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,760
i've gone along

543
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,840
and i've learned from them so the key is

544
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,960
mistakes are okay

545
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,280
as long as you learn from them as long

546
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,640
as you're able to share those stories

547
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,520
with others

548
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,440
so that they won't make the same

549
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,799
mistakes as well

550
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,320
because we have an accountability not

551
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,400
only to ourselves to our organizations

552
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,160
but the security community at large and

553
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,679
by extension

554
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,840
everybody else next slide please

555
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,520
remember when microsoft said they were

556
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:32,720
going to do trustworthy computing and

557
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,080
everybody sort of jumped up and down

558
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,679
said nah it's not going to happen

559
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,080
they did it they did a really good job

560
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,200
security for that particular

561
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,240
organization has

562
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,679
absolutely improved but how do we extend

563
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,320
that beyond that to the wider audience

564
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,919
next slide please is zero trust one of

565
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,120
those answers

566
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,280
now this is a term that usually gets a

567
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,799
lot of

568
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:57,280
blowback as it were because of negative

569
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,240
connotations

570
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,360
because people say oh it's just a

571
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,120
marketing term all right let's flip it

572
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,320
on his head let's call it continuous

573
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,520
trusted access

574
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,799
makes sense um same thing the whole idea

575
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:07,440
here is about

576
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,880
reducing risk in the organization

577
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,760
next slide please

578
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,919
so is it the right choice yes no

579
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:22,080
there is a case to be made for the

580
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,760
maturity of the organization to

581
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,440
understand what it is they're trying to

582
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,960
protect

583
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,720
also understand where they are on the

584
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,559
roadmap for talking about continuous

585
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:31,840
trusted access and how they're going to

586
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,200
get to a better place

587
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,559
because they're working very hard to

588
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,320
protect the workplace the workforce and

589
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,760
the workload

590
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,520
and when we're doing this we have to

591
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,799
realize that

592
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,160
while we may have have erosion of trust

593
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,360
with the users

594
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,760
that we can help establish that at

595
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,440
moving forward and is it easy

596
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,080
no is it for everybody in certain

597
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,280
respects yeah

598
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,320
because this is about reducing risk it's

599
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,760
really that simple

600
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,679
uh we can go into talking about micro

601
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,280
zone segmentation talking about all

602
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,720
these different aspects of it

603
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,400
but the reality is it's really about

604
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,000
getting back to core fundamentals

605
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,600
and tackling things that we should have

606
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,280
been doing a long time ago user

607
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,720
management device management

608
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,679
application control as well as network

609
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,640
zone segmentation

610
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,960
these are just some of the examples next

611
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,640
slide please

612
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,280
because when we're born into this world

613
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:21,679
we

614
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,840
are you know crying we're hungry we're

615
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,320
scared we're looking for

616
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,880
to be safe we're looking for shelter

617
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,559
we're looking to eat

618
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,200
and you know malcolm gladwell talked

619
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,000
about this in his

620
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,159
book talking to strangers about how we

621
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,799
default to trust

622
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,880
unfortunately that does not translate as

623
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,840
we grow up

624
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,679
as we get into computer systems computer

625
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,120
networks and all the rest of it

626
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,080
because it just isn't something that

627
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,840
translates one to one there is no lift

628
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,840
and shift for trust

629
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,960
we have to make sure that we are working

630
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,039
very hard to establish controls and put

631
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:57,679
in place

632
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,039
that will enable people to get their

633
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,640
business done safely and securely and

634
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,600
establish that trust and maintain it

635
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,399
next slide please

636
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,520
always got to work in the breaks next

637
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,158
slide please

638
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,640
we have to move away from some of our

639
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,559
deprecated notions of how we saw

640
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,080
security overall

641
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,919
so in the past you know it was like oh

642
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,520
it's uh we have a firewall everything's

643
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,640
fine

644
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,320
nothing to see here i actually worked in

645
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,919
one organization many many years ago i

646
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:28,240
think

647
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,240
over 15 years ago where the cio looked

648
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,520
at me and said it's okay we trust

649
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,919
everyone's here we have a firewall

650
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,159
um after that particular meeting which

651
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,919
was reviewing the findings for a

652
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:38,880
penetration test

653
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,960
we realized very quickly that that was

654
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,159
not something that was going to hold up

655
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,880
next slide please

656
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,960
now when we're talking about trust when

657
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,960
about you know we could say granting

658
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,080
access without verifying you

659
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,159
say username and password that isn't

660
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,360
really trust

661
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,039
we could say trust is granted because

662
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,039
you've been verified one of those makes

663
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,400
more sense

664
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,320
we need to be able to be sure that the

665
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,360
people that are connecting to our

666
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,720
systems are the ones that are in fact

667
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,919
supposed to be there

668
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,520
another company i worked at years ago we

669
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,000
had various programmers

670
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,320
in a country overseas that were doing

671
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,520
code for us

672
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,200
and they would come into our network and

673
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,039
they would do their stuff and

674
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,559
nothing ever bad happened but my

675
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,080
co-worker said you know have we ever you

676
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,919
know checked to see how things are going

677
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:24,559
there

678
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,960
i'd been on the job for four days i said

679
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,280
i had no idea but i'll check

680
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,960
so we found out in rather short order

681
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,720
that people were coming in from this

682
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,159
country all over the different parts of

683
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:34,960
the country

684
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,320
accessing our network and doing their

685
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,159
jobs which was fine

686
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,080
the problem was they were using the same

687
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,159
key fob for all these people that were

688
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:43,280
separated by

689
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,840
you know very long drives so there was

690
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,200
no way that they were you know

691
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,880
sharing that particular token other than

692
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,320
calling in and getting something to read

693
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,159
the next number off to them to access

694
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,280
the system

695
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,200
they weren't doing this out of a sense

696
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,400
of malice

697
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,760
they were doing this to get their job

698
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,840
done and when we dug

699
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,760
into it we found out that our mistake

700
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,080
was ours because at no point in our

701
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,320
contractual language had we spelled out

702
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,880
that they needed to do various security

703
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,080
steps that we were

704
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,000
specifying because we didn't specify

705
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,240
them and that was a real problem so we

706
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,320
have to make sure that we're building in

707
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,520
an understanding as to what our

708
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,039
requirements are across the board

709
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:19,679
because

710
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,440
you know things are going to cause

711
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,039
trouble if they are not

712
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,320
clearly defined and that trust will tend

713
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,320
to erode over time next slide please

714
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,200
and there's different types of attacks

715
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,480
like i was talking about earlier you

716
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,280
know the

717
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,080
fake news i hate that term but it's here

718
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,120
to stay

719
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,200
um and various types of forms there are

720
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,400
people that are putting it out there

721
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,679
just to make their point

722
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,679
or putting it out there to further a

723
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:46,880
conspiracy theory

724
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,360
or governments trying to influence a

725
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,840
populist to vote a certain way

726
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,000
data misuse is another example and data

727
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,440
breaches are something that constantly

728
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,799
causes trouble

729
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,559
i i started paying attention these back

730
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,320
in about 2012 and i started tracking

731
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,039
these

732
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,960
and nowhere near to what troy does now

733
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,120
kudos to him um but when we're going

734
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,080
through and looking at those data

735
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,360
breaches they were pretty small back

736
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,799
then

737
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,039
now they're in the order of magnitude of

738
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,200
billions of records and they're

739
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,559
happening over and over again

740
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:22,080
and this doesn't have to be this way

741
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,639
next slide

742
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,240
so how can all of this become an attack

743
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,919
against the system

744
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,960
next slide please one great example of

745
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,360
this

746
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,240
is integrity attacks you know subtler or

747
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,000
or

748
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,120
or overt uh corruption of data you know

749
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,640
i talked about that a little bit earlier

750
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,279
with those

751
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,799
particular stories but if somebody's

752
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,559
able to go in and

753
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,880
change the spreadsheet for a financial

754
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,080
report to say

755
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,159
you know their accounts receivable were

756
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,240
x instead of y

757
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,320
and then they had their earnings

758
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,400
announcement the next day

759
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,039
i could have a real horrible effect

760
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,880
we're accusing somebody of a data breach

761
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,480
by dumping a whole lot of passwords on

762
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,679
the internet and saying they were

763
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,679
hacked and it turns out that it was just

764
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:08,880
a whole bunch of different data breaches

765
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,159
that were all stitched together and made

766
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,440
to look that way

767
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,039
in the meantime it had negatively

768
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:14,559
impacted the stock price of that

769
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:15,520
particular company

770
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,360
there's many different ways to look at

771
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,559
this

772
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,480
so when we're talking about securing all

773
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,400
of this we have to tackle you know three

774
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,360
core tenants

775
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,799
next slide please we have to look at

776
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,080
securing the users

777
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,559
the devices and the applications really

778
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,320
is the core fundamentals next slide

779
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,639
please

780
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,279
because our ecosystem has spread you

781
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:39,440
know the idea of the castle wall and the

782
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,279
moat we've all seen the castle

783
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,760
image on network diagrams over the years

784
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,520
this is something we need to do away

785
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,480
with because

786
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,919
that really isn't the way things are

787
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,159
anymore the perimeter is anywhere an

788
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,080
access decision is being made

789
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,080
and we have you know third-party

790
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,000
contractors coming in we have partner

791
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,320
systems we have various applications

792
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,760
that are facing the internet that may or

793
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,039
may not have been through proper

794
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,400
security vetting

795
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,080
these are all different things that

796
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,760
really have to have

797
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,000
a framework overlaid to reduce the risk

798
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,320
next slide please

799
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,320
so zero trust or continuous trusted

800
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,000
access is a great example of this

801
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,159
here's a quick five-step walk-through on

802
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,600
how we could tackle this first of all

803
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,919
you want to establish trust in the users

804
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,600
do you know the users that are in your

805
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,039
environment are they the ones that are

806
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,559
supposed to be there

807
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,240
do you have a manual staff ad remove

808
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,159
process or is it automated

809
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,080
um then the next step from there is you

810
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,520
want to gain visibility into the devices

811
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,679
and activity of what is it they're doing

812
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,520
you know is this dave sitting at a tim

813
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,360
hortons in toronto canada

814
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,840
or am i sitting on the beach in the gold

815
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,640
coast and

816
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,880
causing trouble from there like these

817
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,320
are the kind of things we really

818
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,000
really have to have some method to

819
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,600
verify

820
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,720
next up you want to ensure the

821
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,799
trustworthiness of the devices so is it

822
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,000
patched to current is it

823
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,679
past current or n minus one you know

824
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,760
what is the risk appetite for your

825
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,279
organization that you've set out in

826
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,400
advance

827
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,400
if it hasn't been patched in 30 days do

828
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,919
you have the ability to say okay

829
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:03,440
you can't come in until you address

830
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:05,279
these particular issues

831
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,559
and then being able to place you know

832
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,080
adaptive policies over top of that

833
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,600
saying oh you're in finance you get

834
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,559
these systems

835
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,400
you're in i.t you get access to these

836
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,640
systems and near the twain shall meet or

837
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,360
whatever your

838
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,279
issues are within your own organization

839
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,200
and then fundamentally you'll take us

840
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,120
to talking about a zero trust or

841
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,880
continuous trusted access framework

842
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,840
which is all about reducing risk and

843
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,520
this is definitely something that we can

844
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,399
do

845
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,320
because we have to implement best

846
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,520
practices next slide please

847
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,320
we have to look at verifying the users

848
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,760
verifying their devices

849
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,720
and protecting every application that

850
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,640
means same overly simplistic but

851
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,880
it really does tackle the lion's share

852
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,640
of what we have to contend with

853
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,679
next slide please because

854
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,520
if you've seen the dbir report that came

855
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,039
out today

856
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,880
there is a great example of you know a

857
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,559
higher

858
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,799
80 plus percent of the attacks were

859
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,000
involving you know

860
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,720
human interaction or stolen credentials

861
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,600
there was a high

862
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,240
number of organized crime uh statistics

863
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,440
in there as well

864
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,039
and when we're looking at this and

865
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,640
looking at stolen credentials this is

866
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,240
the stock and trade

867
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,919
of the attackers if they're able to get

868
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,120
user names and passwords from a

869
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,080
third-party website

870
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,320
and use that to attack another website

871
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,640
and then escalate their access

872
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,760
that's a problem so if we can remove

873
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,440
that by adding in another factor having

874
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,720
multi-factor authentication is a great

875
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,760
example of this

876
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:31,200
we can remove the attacker's ability to

877
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,520
really cause harm yes there would be

878
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,120
reputational risk of having username and

879
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,640
password exposed but they wouldn't be

880
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,480
able to do any real damage beyond that

881
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,440
next slide please and we have to be able

882
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,320
to enforce

883
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,000
the systems that have you know poor

884
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,840
security hygiene in a way that

885
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,080
they are not going to get in like in the

886
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,600
past when i used to be able to travel i

887
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,360
would be in a hotel and i hadn't been on

888
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,320
the road for a month

889
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,919
i go to log in it's like oh you have to

890
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:57,919
patch this before you can get in it's

891
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,279
like all right cool

892
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,320
a victim of my own design here but

893
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,000
these are the things we have to

894
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,440
constantly be vigilant about

895
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,919
because next slide please we are always

896
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,840
constantly trying to make sure we're

897
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,240
protecting the workplace the workforce

898
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,440
and the workload

899
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,720
that really does take all the aspects of

900
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,360
our business

901
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,720
into a different buckets next slide

902
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,960
please

903
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,799
so user trust see some repetition here

904
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,039
user trust we need to make sure we know

905
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,799
who the people are that are attaching to

906
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:31,840
our systems

907
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,520
who are the ones that are in our network

908
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,720
does somebody just happen to have a

909
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,360
password

910
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,039
or somebody that we truly know who they

911
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,559
are next slide please we have to be able

912
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,320
to do discovery of our network discovery

913
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,919
over assets and applications to

914
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:44,559
understand

915
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,080
what it is that we're taking the time to

916
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,240
protect next slide please

917
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,919
want to be able to verify is it a

918
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,240
trusted endpoint is it something that we

919
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,520
know is part of our corporate asset

920
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,480
inventory

921
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,799
um or is it a byod device that we have

922
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,039
previously seen or we've approved

923
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:02,799
to gain access to the network these are

924
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:04,720
things that we need to be able to check

925
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,200
or is it something that's untrusted like

926
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,360
in a previous job that i did years ago

927
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,799
i was able to vpn into our company using

928
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,399
a a web browser on an old first gen xbox

929
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:17,039
one

930
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,600
or xbox rather and i was able to check

931
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,720
my email

932
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,320
i did that only because i wanted to see

933
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,600
if it was possible this happened on a

934
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,159
sunday

935
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,760
i got into work on monday and nobody

936
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,760
said anything that was extremely

937
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,919
troubling nobody had noticed that i had

938
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:31,279
done this

939
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:33,520
so i came clean and they were very upset

940
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,960
about it and they wanted my head on a

941
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,320
stick but

942
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,080
this really spoke more to the fact that

943
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,159
we needed that endpoint visibility to

944
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,360
understand what it was that was

945
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,120
attaching to our systems

946
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,640
next slide please we have to be sure

947
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,000
that those devices that are coming in

948
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,200
are the ones that are supposed to be

949
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:49,679
there

950
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,520
we don't need old xboxes or we don't

951
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,679
need systems running windows me

952
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,080
which for whatever reason i saw one go

953
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,919
to my own personal website about a month

954
00:30:57,919 --> 00:30:58,320
ago

955
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,600
i don't know if somebody was trolling me

956
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,240
or they really were using that system

957
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,840
next slide please

958
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,320
oh sorry there's uh and security debt is

959
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,919
a great example of things we have to be

960
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:12,799
aware of

961
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,559
because when we're dealing with you know

962
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,000
establishing trust in the users and the

963
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,799
systems

964
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:19,120
and the data if we are using systems

965
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,279
that have not been patched in years

966
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,039
like you have an os2 warp system that's

967
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,720
running your hvac system and it hasn't

968
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,120
been rebooted in seven years

969
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,519
i've seen that before these are the kind

970
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,120
of things we have to be aware of because

971
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,080
the attackers will

972
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,919
look for these sort of really weird

973
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,399
systems or if it's something that hasn't

974
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,320
been patched in you know several months

975
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,919
but there's a known vulnerability in the

976
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,840
wild we're really doing ourselves a

977
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,039
disservice by not

978
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,720
addressing that a timely fashion

979
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,480
next slide please adaptive policies we

980
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,159
need to be able to go through and apply

981
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,159
policies that make sense

982
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,960
are you from business unit a b or c you

983
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,720
get the policy that works for you

984
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,880
so when they try to access systems that

985
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,240
they should have no

986
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,399
business going into then you're able to

987
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:05,279
control that

988
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,799
and be able to alert on that as well

989
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,080
next slide please now from a policy

990
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,760
perspective you can do all manner of

991
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,480
things

992
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,320
i mean there is you know geo-blocking

993
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,799
which only has limited utility because

994
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,240
you know the attackers can then move

995
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,440
through another system

996
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,720
you know you can't get me on behind

997
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,360
seven proxies um but you can also set

998
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,799
what level of hygiene you're expecting

999
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,480
systems to come in that are going to

1000
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,120
have

1001
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,960
what sort of flexibility for the hours

1002
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,039
of work or where they're coming from

1003
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:35,679
and grace period so if they're able to

1004
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:36,159
get

1005
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,519
into the system or there's something

1006
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,279
wrong and they lock themselves out

1007
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,039
you say okay you're locked out for this

1008
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:43,519
amount of time then we'll try again

1009
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,600
um and this gives the responders a

1010
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,440
chance to look at the system and say

1011
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,159
okay

1012
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:50,480
maybe not everything is entirely uh up

1013
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,919
to snuff here

1014
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,720
next slide please

1015
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,559
we want to be able to protect every

1016
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,799
application in our organization

1017
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,200
are you using office 365 or using g

1018
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,440
suite or whatever it happens to be

1019
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,080
there's no reason that somebody in new

1020
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:06,640
zealand

1021
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,120
or thailand or canada should be

1022
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,720
accessing your network if they don't

1023
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,000
work for you

1024
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,919
so why would you not have them go

1025
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,600
through a reverse proxy in order for

1026
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,200
them to access the system so you have

1027
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,640
them go to reverse proxy

1028
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,960
authenticate and then be able to access

1029
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,760
the systems

1030
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,240
rather than going to them directly this

1031
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,840
is again about limiting risk in your

1032
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,200
organization

1033
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,039
we can do better next slide please

1034
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,519
and when we look at this we realize that

1035
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,840
as we move towards a risk reduction

1036
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,679
framework as we move to continuous

1037
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:38,799
trusted access

1038
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,559
we're verifying all the users the

1039
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,240
devices and the applications in our

1040
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,120
environment

1041
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,960
and we're ostensibly getting a little

1042
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,480
bit closer to having

1043
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,600
that jet pack that has really

1044
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,919
eluded us for a very long time or at

1045
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,679
least me anyway

1046
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,880
um next slide please we have to talk

1047
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,880
about the ephemeral nature of trust

1048
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,240
it's neither binary it's neither

1049
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,880
permanent but it has to be constantly

1050
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,840
revisited and constantly verified

1051
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,120
when we're doing this we have to do it

1052
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,879
in a way that's enabling the users to

1053
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,079
get their jobs done

1054
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,679
to understand the process and

1055
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,760
democratize security by making it easy

1056
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,000
easy as possible for them to do things

1057
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,399
without negatively impacting them

1058
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,639
now what conditions need to be true in

1059
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,159
order for them to gain access to the

1060
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:22,800
system

1061
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,159
and how long are they allowed to be able

1062
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,000
to come in how long are you allowing

1063
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,679
that trust to be in effect

1064
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,280
you say yes you're good for the next

1065
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,440
hour you're good for the next 18 hours

1066
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,839
that's really something that is germane

1067
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,520
to the conversation about risk within

1068
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,480
your own organization

1069
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:41,280
next slide please

1070
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,040
so what happens in a community without

1071
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,000
trust i think we all know that

1072
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,520
if we don't have trust the community

1073
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,040
falls apart

1074
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,560
what happens about a society without

1075
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,079
trust

1076
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,639
the society falls apart it's not a good

1077
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,079
place to be

1078
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:01,119
next slide please revisiting this from

1079
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:01,599
earlier

1080
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,440
we established trust with honesty

1081
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,280
transparency parenthesis

1082
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,119
predictability capability willingness to

1083
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,640
correct the mistakes we've made

1084
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,800
and accountability to ourselves as well

1085
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,720
as to our organizations and the wider

1086
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,480
audience overall

1087
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,359
next slide please we're able to do this

1088
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,119
by having prevention detection and

1089
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,079
correction

1090
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,480
having the right tools in place after

1091
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,680
you've done your homework

1092
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,760
you've looked at all the assets in your

1093
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,720
environment

1094
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,119
the users the devices the applications

1095
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,960
the systems the networks

1096
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,720
once you understand that then you can

1097
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,240
have the conversation about tools

1098
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,480
next slide please

1099
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,320
we have to make sure that we are able to

1100
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,079
have trustworthy data and trustworthy

1101
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,680
systems and we have to make it in such a

1102
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,599
way that they cannot be separated from

1103
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,040
trustworthy people

1104
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,520
we don't want to negatively influence

1105
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,880
how things are going to do

1106
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,119
happen how they're going to roll out

1107
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,640
because we missed a step

1108
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,560
because we didn't do our job because we

1109
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,920
missed a patch

1110
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,240
it's a constant battle but we have to

1111
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,599
understand that mistakes are going to

1112
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:04,720
may be made

1113
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,240
next slide please and you know

1114
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,200
mistakes happen all the time we have to

1115
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,800
understand that what may seem like a

1116
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,160
small mistake could have a horrible

1117
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,240
knock-on effect

1118
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,079
next slide please so as we're getting

1119
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,599
further along the conversation of

1120
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,440
talking about continuous trust taxes and

1121
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,119
talking about reducing risk on our

1122
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,160
environments

1123
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,839
we realize that we're getting a little

1124
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,599
bit closer to that dream

1125
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:32,240
of having a personal jet pack maybe i'll

1126
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,000
be able to expense one one day

1127
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,640
and be able to have that future that we

1128
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,520
were promised all those many moons ago

1129
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,200
i would like to thank everyone for being

1130
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,200
here today i really do appreciate the

1131
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,520
chance to be here if only as a giant

1132
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,960
floating head on your screen

1133
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,560
and thank you once again i really

1134
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,240
appreciate your time today next slide

1135
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,479
please

1136
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,480
thank you very much if you want drop me

1137
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,960
an email or follow me on the twitters

1138
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,320
and i hope you have a great rest of your

1139
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,960
conference today

1140
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,839
hopefully you can hear the clapping

1141
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:06,079
thank you very much um

1142
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,160
anyone else lodged any questions on the

1143
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,680
app

1144
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,440
if you have let me know because i can

1145
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,800
only see the one that i lodged on the

1146
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,520
app

1147
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,040
uh and i just thought i'd throw this one

1148
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,640
at you as a sort of side

1149
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,599
issue how do you feel about one identity

1150
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:20,800
to sort of rule them all

1151
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,560
i'm talking about identity not directory

1152
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,920
here

1153
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,920
so based on real world id or something

1154
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,920
because governments like you to have

1155
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,280
one id um so that feeling of one

1156
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,280
identity versus having many identities

1157
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,800
like a government one a corporate one a

1158
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
social one you know do you see that one

1159
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,040
b

1160
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,240
is safer than many or do you see it the

1161
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:40,800
other way

1162
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,440
or is there some other ground in there

1163
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,320
okay so

1164
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,240
we here in canada we do have something

1165
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,560
similar about that sort of subject

1166
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,079
where they're talking about creating

1167
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,000
this sort of digital identification

1168
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,400
where i lean more to it is if that is

1169
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,000
going to be created it should be

1170
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,720
controlled by the user themselves

1171
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,160
i don't believe that the government

1172
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,760
should be the ones controlling that

1173
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,680
particular identification

1174
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,800
okay oh that's my echo um so we want to

1175
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:07,920
make sure that

1176
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,920
we are giving them the ability to

1177
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,760
control that and i you know i wrote a

1178
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,280
paper about it at school where i was

1179
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,280
using dna as part of the marker for the

1180
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:15,920
key

1181
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,280
you know there are different ways to do

1182
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,720
it and that's just it we want to make

1183
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,839
sure that the key

1184
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,760
belongs to that person could not be

1185
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,599
cannot be taken from that person

1186
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,520
and they have the ability to revoke it

1187
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,520
if they need to

1188
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,520
that's just my personal event yeah cool

1189
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,720
well that makes sense

1190
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,960
i like the dna comment you made there i

1191
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,400
mean that one you can change but it just

1192
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,520
takes lots of time and

1193
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,440
uh mutation that you don't necessarily

1194
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,800
want yeah
