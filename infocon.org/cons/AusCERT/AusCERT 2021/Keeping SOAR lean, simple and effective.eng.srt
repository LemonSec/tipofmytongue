1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,120
with the um hybrid people so take your

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,480
seats and i just have to get going

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,000
good morning and wasn't the first day of

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,160
ulcer 2021 our 20th year at the

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,280
conference

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,920
um as we are a virtual event or virtual

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,519
hybrid event this year everything's

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:16,239
going to be

9
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,240
streamed live and the way the streaming

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,480
platform works is it's a very hard start

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,160
and stop deadline

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,160
so bang on the start time and right on

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,920
the stop time we literally have to stop

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,359
so one of the key things we need to do

15
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,720
both to make sure it's fair for both

16
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,400
people in person and remote

17
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,920
do use the conference app to actually

18
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,360
submit your questions and that way at

19
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,559
the end of the session if there's time

20
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,440
for questions

21
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,200
the presenter can actually answer those

22
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,360
questions then but can also answer those

23
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,120
questions at a later time

24
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,480
okay for a first session here in the

25
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,480
southport room um we've got

26
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,640
dushyan satharaju who's the cyber sec

27
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,399
ops league for deakin university

28
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,879
um secops manager for deakin university

29
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,160
i'm going to be telling us how to

30
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,280
actually do soar

31
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,360
in as lightweight a manner as possible

32
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,559
but to make it effective

33
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,039
please welcome thank you thanks thanks

34
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,800
for the nice introduction

35
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,280
um so i'll be talking today about a bit

36
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,119
about our experience our our journey

37
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,320
about how we've

38
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,560
managed to get around to implementing

39
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,320
our security operation center or

40
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,880
security strategy at deakin

41
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,000
so my name is ashant i

42
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,240
work in i work for deakin university

43
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,000
have been there for quite some time now

44
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,200
and

45
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,720
our security journey has has been fairly

46
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,280
recent so we've gone through a four-year

47
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,680
journey of security maturity

48
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,200
recently and i'm going to talk a bit

49
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,439
about that so before we start

50
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,880
just to give everyone a bit of an

51
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,880
overview on who we are

52
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,920
we are a university based in victoria

53
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,079
regional and in melbourne so we have

54
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,600
about 64 65 000 students

55
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,479
about 19 000 staff both sessional and

56
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,759
continuing

57
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,840
and we spread across four campuses in

58
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,360
victoria

59
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,680
we we have about 15 000 managed to work

60
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,399
stations

61
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,759
and about 30 000 servers across two data

62
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,439
centers in victoria so we

63
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,960
are a fairly on-prem organization um

64
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,479
and in it about 250 staff

65
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,680
and 10 staff in security and

66
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,720
uh four in security operations

67
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,760
so and then this our scope

68
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,040
is uh managing security for all of the

69
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,879
university that includes

70
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,400
uh everything from critical

71
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,480
infrastructure within the university

72
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,440
through to um you know managing security

73
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,959
for researchers

74
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,040
uh in the organization so there's a

75
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,120
broad diversity within

76
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,840
within the industry and that's that's

77
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,599
where this actually becomes

78
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,040
more and more challenging and

79
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,760
interesting at the same time

80
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,879
so a bit about our journey in the

81
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,680
university

82
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,440
so we've started a security maturity

83
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,519
uplift program about four years ago

84
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,959
called deakinshield

85
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,280
uh which is where we've you know started

86
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,879
from from scratch

87
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,680
said uh implemented a few technique uh

88
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,720
technical

89
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,080
controls so that was the the exercise

90
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,239
that we've embarked to prepare

91
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,720
for uh going for setting up a security

92
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,080
operation center

93
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,599
and then uh this is um by no means a

94
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,080
phased

95
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,000
approach we're still doing a lot of

96
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,400
preparation work uh to try and get

97
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
uh some of the use cases and controls in

98
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,440
place but

99
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,159
essentially we've picked a few uh low

100
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,040
hanging fruit

101
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,360
uh started uh putting in some tech

102
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,720
secured uh technical controls in place

103
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,400
and we've tuned them

104
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,040
implemented secure configuration to

105
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,879
ensure that there's preventive controls

106
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,000
in place to

107
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,360
prevent from cyber attacks and

108
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,599
we've then started doing some law

109
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,519
collection and analysis

110
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,040
and then starting to respond so a very

111
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,239
straightforward approach there and while

112
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:57,519
we were doing that we were

113
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,840
identifying rooms for improvement and

114
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,560
automate

115
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,120
the analysis and response where possible

116
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,720
so today i'm

117
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,280
going to go through a few use cases

118
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,239
where we've actually

119
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,200
done some automation uh something simple

120
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,519
uh

121
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,200
something that we've done with the tools

122
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,280
that we've already had licensed

123
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,079
for uh have already had license for or

124
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:18,399
uh

125
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,079
open source tools that we've leveraged

126
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,199
so a very lean approach there

127
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,000
uh just talking a bit quickly about uh

128
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:26,880
preparation

129
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,680
so we've uh we've basically put in

130
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,479
controls in

131
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,680
in different parts uh of the network

132
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,320
and the organization so um parameter

133
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,720
controls so board of firewall

134
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,759
body firewalls f5 load balancers that

135
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:42,000
also

136
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,280
work as web application firewalls um

137
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,120
we've put some controls for people so

138
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,320
we've done uh

139
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,240
training awareness and training programs

140
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,440
that we've set up

141
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,800
for uh for staff and students

142
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,639
we've also set up you know things like

143
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,240
multi-factor authentication

144
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,800
which we've rolled out to all staff and

145
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,080
almost about

146
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,360
we're currently rolling it out to

147
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,840
students with almost 50 percent there

148
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,120
and hopefully by the end of the month we

149
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,479
would finish our rollout for all

150
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,080
students as well

151
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,080
uh and we have you know endpoint

152
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,840
protection um

153
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,479
uh protection in the network layer so

154
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,080
we've

155
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,759
done some work there implementing

156
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,360
technical tools like

157
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,400
stealthwatch which gives you a good

158
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,560
overview and netflow traffic

159
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,600
uh and we've also had uh put in some

160
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,880
controls for

161
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,000
uh securing information um as such which

162
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
i'll walk through in a bit

163
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,120
so once once some of those technology

164
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,680
uh tools were put in place we've looked

165
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,720
at what

166
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,720
are the quick wins that we can actually

167
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,759
get from

168
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,039
from those controls so as you can see

169
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,240
we've started putting together some

170
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,960
basic security controls for dns so the

171
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,600
first

172
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,600
product that we or tool set that we

173
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,199
started working with was

174
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,560
cisco umbrella for dns protection and

175
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,280
we just did the bare minimum we said we

176
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,479
will start with

177
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,919
blocking uh malicious sites and

178
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,280
uh blocking uh adult content

179
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,160
uh as a starting point and you know like

180
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,280
universities um

181
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,199
if you've exceeded any experience

182
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,560
working for or with

183
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,639
your university you would know there is

184
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,000
no one rule that fits

185
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,199
all so at every stage we had to actually

186
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,800
identify how we would

187
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,360
manage exemptions for for some of those

188
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,479
rule sets so

189
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,039
once we've done some dns protection and

190
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,360
content filtering based on dns

191
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,520
uh we started implementing we started

192
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,520
with implementation of uh

193
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,479
email security so we've we've basically

194
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,319
started blocking known bad

195
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,360
spam that that we've

196
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,919
when we started dropping malicious

197
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,599
emails as we see fit

198
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,120
and then we've implemented endpoint

199
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,759
protection and application whitelisting

200
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,280
on endpoint and lock

201
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,240
uh locking down admin rights uh where

202
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,080
possible so i think that was

203
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,280
a really good win so this is like

204
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,960
it's it's a good starting place if

205
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,560
you've not done

206
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,240
a lot of security in the organization

207
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,840
this is a really good place to start

208
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,319
and then we started then we started

209
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,479
seeing then we started collecting logs

210
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,400
so we started

211
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,479
logging information coming out as some

212
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:29,520
of these tool sets

213
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,639
into uh our logging platforms

214
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,840
and we tried to set up a few playbooks

215
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,319
so we

216
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:37,840
tried to understand from a business

217
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,840
point of view what are the things that

218
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,639
we need

219
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,639
that we're most concerned about so

220
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,160
identify use cases

221
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,000
and prioritize the ones that we need to

222
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,520
start working with

223
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,960
and we started writing a custom place

224
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,919
to to mitigate that so this was when

225
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,680
before we actually had

226
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,759
multi-factor authentication rolled out

227
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,960
to our students

228
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,639
uh where we had a play that basically

229
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,800
looks at uh authentication logs on our

230
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,479
single sign-on platform

231
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,680
and shows you uh impossible it's an

232
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,000
impossible travel use case so

233
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,599
looks at login sessions and

234
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,000
the time or distance that it takes to go

235
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,800
from one

236
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,599
point to another and we've been using

237
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,080
this

238
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,280
as a means to identify any

239
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,039
um account compromises

240
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,039
and we started that as a starting point

241
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,519
so some of these use cases instead of

242
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,000
actually putting an energy on automating

243
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,080
uh response to this use case we spend

244
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,080
that energy in trying to

245
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,599
fix the problem by introducing

246
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,760
multi-factor authentication so

247
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,080
uh half the time some of the plays that

248
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,800
you see

249
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,320
there are probably better and more

250
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,760
efficient ways of actually addressing

251
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,519
the problem so it doesn't always have to

252
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,080
be

253
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,200
how can we get this to the analysts this

254
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,560
alert to the analyst as quickly as

255
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,640
possible and what buttons do they click

256
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,680
to make

257
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,320
uh this an actionable response so that's

258
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,839
that's a very different way of looking

259
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:04,240
at

260
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,519
um security automation so that's why we

261
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:08,000
we

262
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,600
started looking at how can we make this

263
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,279
more efficient for the business overall

264
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,279
and then we started we've implemented a

265
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,720
tool that does some

266
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,080
machine learning so we what we struggled

267
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,959
with was

268
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,519
prioritizing these alerts so for

269
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,160
instance if we actually had a

270
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,760
user who's reached out who's

271
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,680
visited a malicious website

272
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,720
identifying what that malicious website

273
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,200
was

274
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,200
and what that user was that a legitimate

275
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,320
dns request to that website is actually

276
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,000
a challenging thing to do because we

277
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,920
also have cyber security researchers on

278
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,680
the same network as we have financial

279
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,720
staff

280
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,120
so if there's a staff member in accounts

281
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,880
payable

282
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,160
visiting a an infected site

283
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,279
a known bad site as to

284
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,920
someone in the school of i.t uh doing

285
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,600
research and cyber security

286
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,519
you'd want to prioritize those alerts

287
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,279
differently so that's where we bought a

288
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,320
machine learning tool

289
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,959
in place which gave us that context so

290
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,320
which gave a

291
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,880
risk score for these alerts based on the

292
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,079
peer group so

293
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,760
is this normal behavior for that

294
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,680
particular user is it normal behavior

295
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,320
for

296
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,440
the users around them in the pe group

297
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,880
which is how we've started to prioritize

298
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,160
these alerts so the

299
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,640
i have i have two examples here the

300
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,160
first one is

301
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,079
um are you a non-executive user logging

302
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,000
into an executive machine so

303
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,320
like we were really uh trying to target

304
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,600
and identify

305
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
uh if there were any malicious login

306
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,680
into uh

307
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,600
workstations that owned by executives in

308
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,360
this use case it was a

309
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,279
support staff member logging in and

310
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,560
trying to help

311
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,640
an executive but it's it's still a good

312
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,399
alert to actually get some

313
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,760
visibility on and the second one um is

314
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,920
is one of those uh impossible travel use

315
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,040
cases where

316
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,000
we've had a student who's um who's

317
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,839
basically a staff member sorry in this

318
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,040
case who's actually

319
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,480
uh logged in from a new country that

320
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,279
they've never locked in from before

321
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,480
and we've also seen that there was

322
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,000
email there were emails sent to

323
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,680
disposable email addresses so

324
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,560
suspected data breach but when we

325
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,279
actually

326
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,279
created the user they were just doing

327
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,800
something um

328
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,200
dodgy with setting up some subscription

329
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,279
services using a vpn that they couldn't

330
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,120
access from australia so

331
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,800
it's interesting to see it's not a

332
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
breach but this this sort of data is

333
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,000
really interesting

334
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,800
uh to look at and once we started doing

335
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,079
a lot of this analysis

336
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,240
was we struggled to figure out how we

337
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,000
actually respond to these

338
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,040
uh events one of the biggest issue we've

339
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,079
had where we

340
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,880
thought we need to improve improve

341
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,440
quickly

342
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,800
was uh was actually doing the response

343
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,279
part so if we actually had to block an

344
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,760
ip address for instance

345
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,079
on the board of firewall we had to log a

346
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:10,959
service ticket

347
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,800
for the networking team to do this for

348
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,040
us because we didn't have access to

349
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,320
every appliance

350
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,440
in the uh in the infrastructure this was

351
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,959
getting more and more challenging for us

352
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,320
we wanted a more

353
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,360
efficient way of doing this

354
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,760
and that's when we started looking at uh

355
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,079
use cases that where we can actually

356
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,720
improve so i'll talk through uh three

357
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,240
different use cases that we've looked at

358
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,360
where we've actually done some

359
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,279
automation to make it more

360
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,600
efficient for us one is one of our

361
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,720
biggest pain point

362
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,440
and i think most most of you guys would

363
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,800
also agree with me

364
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,839
is uh phishing emails getting people to

365
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,040
identify

366
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,399
um spear phishing emails getting

367
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,639
your staff or your users to actually

368
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,160
report it to you

369
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,959
and responding to those alerts so this

370
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,959
was one of our biggest pain point

371
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:03,200
and the way we actually did this was we

372
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,240
uh we

373
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,760
implemented an add-on on outlook

374
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,639
that allow people to easily report an

375
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:11,360
email

376
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,079
when we first started doing campaigns

377
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:14,959
for

378
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,480
staff to report emails they would just

379
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,240
forward it to us

380
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,160
which didn't make a lot of sense from a

381
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,760
security analyst point of view because

382
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,200
you don't have the right headers to do

383
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,639
any analysis

384
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,320
so we started then um

385
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,959
then getting everyone to use this fish

386
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,079
alert button

387
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,639
uh which they would uh which which would

388
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,360
just

389
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,560
uh forward the email as an attachment

390
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,519
to us and would give them a quick prompt

391
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,440
that the the forward was successful and

392
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,279
deletes the email from their inbox

393
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,079
so it was a very easy way for our staff

394
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,240
to be able to report emails to us

395
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,120
and then we we used to uh like literally

396
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,519
manually go through every single email

397
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,839
that got forwarded to a shared mailbox

398
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,199
and do analysis

399
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,320
and it was getting noisy by the day so

400
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,920
if there was a phishing campaign that

401
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,800
went to uh you know 3 000 staff in the

402
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,680
organization

403
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,399
and 500 of them reported that's 500

404
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,920
emails to go through

405
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,399
so this was very draining for us in

406
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,240
terms of resourcing we were spending a

407
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,360
lot of time on this

408
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,160
and we wanted to to find a more

409
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,320
efficient way of doing this

410
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,040
that's where we did our first automation

411
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:25,839
use case

412
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,959
so what we've basically done was we

413
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,040
implemented a tool called fish er which

414
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,880
is a no before

415
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,839
tool set and um that would basically

416
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,760
receive this phishing email

417
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,000
and it will group the you can actually

418
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,639
group phishing emails together

419
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,760
based on subject based on sender so you

420
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,760
can actually respond to them in a group

421
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,320
um which is great and you you can

422
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,800
actually

423
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,240
look at uh this it extracts domains and

424
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,279
urls for you

425
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,399
as you can see as you can see on the top

426
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,720
and it also look uh pulls out the

427
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,600
attachments

428
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,920
uh which we sent to then a sandbox

429
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,000
environment to deploy safely

430
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,320
and interact with so this was a really

431
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,240
good way for us to actually

432
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,959
identify uh phishing emails and then we

433
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,880
started prioritizing based on how many

434
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,240
people have actually received those

435
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,279
emails

436
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,480
um and we were able to get to a point

437
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,240
where our response time

438
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,800
went from uh three to four business days

439
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,000
to respond to a phishing

440
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,839
email down to a few hours um

441
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,920
and that was a that was a massive win

442
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,959
for us

443
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:34,800
and then we started getting to a point

444
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
where we were like uh

445
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,639
not everyone who receives a phishing

446
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,240
email reports it

447
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,399
in my organization fortunately majority

448
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,240
of them do

449
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,440
but then we started identifying that

450
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,639
there are a lot of people who actually

451
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,880
don't so how do we deal with that

452
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,600
and then we've implemented a new add-on

453
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,000
to this

454
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,600
tool um that basically so as you can see

455
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,639
here if that's

456
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,519
clear at all um we've you can actually

457
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:02,880
see that

458
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,000
we can run a query against o365

459
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,519
and we can actually see how many users

460
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,720
have actually

461
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,800
seen this email before so this is the

462
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,160
view that we get

463
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,800
so uh in this section you can actually

464
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,759
see

465
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,560
um how many people have actually read

466
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,240
the email

467
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,480
where the email is is currently sitting

468
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,959
in the in the 365 instance so

469
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,959
have they deleted it is it in there in

470
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,800
their junk email folder

471
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,759
or have they archived it so you can

472
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:34,639
actually see that

473
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,279
quickly and you can also respond so you

474
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,519
can proactively go and delete the email

475
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,040
from everyone's inbox

476
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,199
from here so which is which is really

477
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,040
good we've done this for a few phishing

478
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,480
campaigns where we

479
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,279
we thought the risk is too broad uh

480
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,079
because

481
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,360
you know people are working from home

482
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,639
they're not necessarily going through

483
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,160
the corporate network

484
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,000
they don't have the same level of

485
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,519
protection because some of them are

486
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,680
actually using vio devices

487
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,079
so we need to act quickly so this is

488
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,360
where we were able to do this at the

489
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,720
click of a button

490
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,039
and um that's that's how we actually got

491
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,000
value in

492
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,119
automating our our first use case

493
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,000
for phishing emails what we then started

494
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:14,400
seeing

495
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,720
like uh you'd see that there's actually

496
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,599
a pattern here

497
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,720
like we identify a pain point we try and

498
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,119
address that pain point and then we

499
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,240
um we try and improve that over time so

500
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,880
it's it's not a set and forget uh like

501
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,960
we've heard in today's keynote

502
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,720
uh soar or any automation is not a

503
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,160
certain thing you have to

504
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,240
constantly keep improving this

505
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,320
and you you constantly have to try and

506
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,000
make this more efficient

507
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,039
to to your security analysts then

508
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,799
what we started doing is we started

509
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,240
looking at emails

510
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,240
um that are actually being sent by

511
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,480
different parts of the organization

512
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,919
um that that don't really look legit

513
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,160
uh so we recently had a marketing

514
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
campaign that went out a survey link

515
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,280
that went out to

516
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,120
a bunch of staff members to click on a

517
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,400
survey monkey link and

518
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,880
most of them ended up reporting it to us

519
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,600
so

520
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,240
we will we were like we need to condone

521
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,000
the bad practice

522
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,320
but we also need to figure out a way to

523
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,240
automate so the automation that we've

524
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,600
done where we don't actually have a

525
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,039
security analyst

526
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,200
um manually looking at emails was

527
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,160
automate

528
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,440
uh known false positives so we we

529
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,960
knew that uh servicenow emails um

530
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,640
a couple of months ago we we had

531
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,400
servicenow emails going through

532
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,640
from a service in our domain and doesn't

533
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,480
look come from a deacon domain and a lot

534
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,840
of people were reporting

535
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,600
them if they've never seen them before

536
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,080
so we created the other rules to

537
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,720
try and address that so we created the

538
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,640
rules to respond

539
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,840
to known good emails so to identify

540
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,600
those false positive and respond to the

541
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,880
users

542
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,080
so that's that's the first use case that

543
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,480
i want to talk about the second one i

544
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,840
wanted to talk

545
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,120
through was is automation for

546
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,160
reducing risk of data breach so

547
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,679
one of the biggest risks that we've

548
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,440
identified lately is

549
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,640
uh people over sharing files with uh

550
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,400
accidentally so without actually having

551
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,240
the knowledge of what those

552
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,640
file share commissions mean uh we're

553
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,120
seeing this more and more in the 365

554
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,080
platform where you know users are

555
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,440
generating public links

556
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,360
to um to files in their personal

557
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,360
onedrive folder and sharing that with

558
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,960
other staff members because they

559
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,760
think that's the easiest way interesting

560
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,960
enough we recently had a

561
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,080
a breach where someone has put in a a

562
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,039
sensitive file

563
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,080
in a meeting invite and their

564
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,559
calendar was accessible to other staff

565
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,440
members

566
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,000
in their organization and that link was

567
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,840
a public link to a onedrive folder in

568
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,960
their

569
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,520
file share so this was an outstanding

570
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,760
risk that we needed to address

571
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,640
and the way we went to do uh addressing

572
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,600
this risk was

573
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,960
uh to we basically leveraged two tools

574
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,280
that we had already uh been licensed for

575
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,640
with the microsoft suite

576
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,600
one was the microsoft cloud app security

577
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,320
portal

578
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
um which was something that we were

579
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,679
already licensed for

580
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,200
and the other which we used for

581
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,960
automation was

582
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,679
the microsoft power automate platform

583
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:26,880
i had to really think of the name

584
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,159
because they keep changing their name on

585
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,400
me all the time

586
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,880
so this what you see here are basically

587
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,799
alerts that are generated by policies

588
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,240
that we've set up in the cloud app

589
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,600
security portal

590
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,280
um so cloud up security has actually

591
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,960
been really good for us because it gave

592
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,559
us visibility to

593
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,640
uh sas solutions and cloud solutions

594
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,880
that we had no visibility for we

595
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,400
couldn't get logs for

596
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,559
what was happening within uh tools like

597
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,480
workday 365

598
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,840
but we were able to do that do that here

599
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,000
so as you can see there's an alert that

600
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,679
gets generated every time

601
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,760
a file is shared with the entire

602
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,960
organization

603
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,320
or has a public link

604
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,120
and what we do then is we actually pass

605
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,080
that alert

606
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,480
through microsoft power automate so we

607
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,000
basically extract

608
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,480
our key information from these alerts

609
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,120
and

610
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,080
um and forward that alert back to the

611
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,840
user in an email

612
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,400
um asking them to confirm if this was

613
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,360
actually done

614
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,159
intentionally or was done accidentally

615
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,520
so this was really good

616
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,440
uh to uh promote awareness uh about file

617
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,159
sharing so

618
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,240
what we realized with awareness was if

619
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,919
you're trying to give people examples

620
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,120
that they can relate to

621
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,960
or that are that is really close to what

622
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,280
they're doing uh it's it's much

623
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,840
better received than just broadcasting

624
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,760
information about security

625
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,480
um and this is the actual end user's

626
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,120
view

627
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,400
so they basically get an email um that's

628
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:54,799
that's

629
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,840
requesting for input and it has three

630
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,200
different options at the bottom so it

631
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,120
has some information there about

632
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,880
how to uh share information so

633
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,200
we call we call that a campaign sharing

634
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,120
with care

635
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,880
and we basically had three different

636
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,720
action items for the end user

637
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,039
so do you want to keep sharing this file

638
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,400
do you want to remove

639
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,640
five sharing permissions so you might

640
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,400
look at the file path and the file name

641
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,159
and realize

642
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,919
oh my god this shouldn't actually be

643
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,559
public and then you can remove the users

644
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,159
or you can just choose to remove any

645
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:29,600
external sharing permissions

646
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,240
so you might think um i don't actually

647
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,280
don't want any

648
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,960
anyone outside the organization to view

649
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,799
this but i don't really care if

650
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,960
it is internal only so these are the

651
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,240
sorts of things that we had to do

652
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,159
because we can't have a policy that

653
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:42,960
applies

654
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,679
for everyone we can't say no users can't

655
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:46,080
share

656
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,159
files with externally because we're a

657
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,760
university at the end of the day so we

658
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,799
have to deal with

659
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,840
the limitation of what the organization

660
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,000
offers

661
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,120
so this this is uh this has been a very

662
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,280
powerful automation tool for us

663
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,240
and again this kind of gives it i hope

664
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,159
this gives people perspective that

665
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,159
automation doesn't necessarily have to

666
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,640
be an alert that goes to

667
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,480
your sock analyst to be able to respond

668
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,440
this alert our stock and list don't even

669
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,280
see them so it goes straight to the end

670
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,080
user

671
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,760
and if they don't respond to within a

672
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,080
certain time frame we remove permissions

673
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,600
on the file anyway

674
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,600
so this has been really good for us

675
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,760
because uh the other challenge

676
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,919
being in security that we've had is

677
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,280
we've educated

678
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,480
our users not to click on uh dodgy links

679
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,480
not to talk to people who

680
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,320
they don't trust and not respond to call

681
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,080
calls and when we are

682
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,799
trying to get in touch with um staff

683
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:43,440
members

684
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,760
asking them to you know either reset the

685
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,559
password

686
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:51,200
or do things they don't trust us anymore

687
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,799
which is which is a really good problem

688
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,039
to have because you don't want them to

689
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:57,120
just randomly respond to anyone who

690
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,639
calls them out of the blue

691
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,240
so the last use case i want to talk talk

692
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:04,640
about

693
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,039
is uh bringing all of this together like

694
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:07,679
the

695
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,720
the important thing is um that we

696
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,279
like i said in one of my previous slides

697
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,400
that we are

698
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,159
struggling to actually respond because

699
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,360
we actually don't have

700
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,120
access to some of these tool sets so we

701
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,440
want to be able to respond

702
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,840
more efficiently and to be able to do

703
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:26,720
that you need

704
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,320
uh you need to be able to bring all the

705
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,760
data together in a tool

706
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,440
where your staff can access and analyze

707
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,559
information

708
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,400
and be able to respond from the tool

709
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,840
itself so

710
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,760
one of the big shifts that we're doing

711
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,200
is to actually

712
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,279
centralize all the indicators that we

713
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,440
have within the organization

714
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,159
so um when something gets blocked

715
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:48,799
somewhere

716
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:51,679
everyone knows where it was blocked and

717
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,039
why it was blocked

718
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,159
um because we've had instances where we

719
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:57,120
block a

720
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,760
malicious ip address that an amazon ip

721
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,600
address or something

722
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,200
that's that's that belongs to a shared

723
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,039
service and then it

724
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,760
two days later it breaks something else

725
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,960
so we need to understand

726
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,799
if something is blocked why it's blocked

727
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:13,760
and be able to give users that feedback

728
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,440
so to be able to do that we've used it

729
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,080
we've set up our misp instance to

730
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,440
um to have all the indicators that we

731
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,480
are concerned about listed in there and

732
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,679
then

733
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,440
we have been integrate we have

734
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,120
integrated that with uh

735
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,679
an open source project called the hive

736
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:32,159
um

737
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,559
and we basically if anyone has attended

738
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,520
the yesterday's

739
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,400
tutorial on hive you you see that this

740
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,039
it's a

741
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,159
it's a good value tool it's open source

742
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,200
which is great

743
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,440
and you're able to pull in all the

744
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,880
information all the alerts to one

745
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,080
central place

746
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,919
where you can actually respond because

747
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,520
your traditional ticketing services

748
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,200
don't really cater for security use

749
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,080
cases

750
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,960
so they don't have like a triage making

751
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,720
this a video service now it doesn't like

752
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,039
i really have a triage mechanism to

753
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,480
filter through alerts

754
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,880
um every alert is the case so over here

755
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,480
or at least you can actually pick which

756
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,240
alerts that you actually want

757
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,919
to add to a case and you can group

758
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:11,760
alerts together

759
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,520
in the example here i have a use case

760
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,159
where

761
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,320
we have a splunk search that goes

762
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,520
through and looks at

763
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,880
newly created domains with combinations

764
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,080
of the words deacon

765
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,559
in it uh to identify phishing campaigns

766
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,000
and phishing urls

767
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,320
uh for those who actually don't report

768
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,679
them to us

769
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,080
and uh this basically does a splunk

770
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:34,799
search i

771
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,039
i wish it was a bit clearer but this

772
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:38,080
basically does

773
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,640
uh does a long search and it extracts

774
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,320
that information through here

775
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,360
and it identified two domains um

776
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,200
and you can see that one domain is

777
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,000
actually a legit domain that was set up

778
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,760
by

779
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,200
a university student club and at the

780
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:57,120
other domain is a malicious domain that

781
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,000
was set up to

782
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,679
send it hasn't fortunately been used so

783
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:03,039
far but we blocked it in our

784
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:05,200
organization

785
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,679
and you can see we've we're able to uh

786
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,360
enrich this data by

787
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,960
um pulling in information from uh

788
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,760
talos and our umbrella instance to see

789
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,440
if this is already blocked

790
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,279
because more often than not you'd see a

791
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:20,880
phishing campaign and you look at the

792
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:21,840
domain

793
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,399
and you think uh this domain we need to

794
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:25,360
block this

795
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,080
but you know your security provider

796
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,679
probably would have already blocked it

797
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,039
so this is a good way of actually

798
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,399
looking at which ones are already

799
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:33,120
blocked

800
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,799
so over here you can actually see that

801
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,399
this is all this was already part of our

802
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,279
blacklist

803
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,799
and it was already blocked so we don't

804
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,720
actually need to take an action

805
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,720
but if we needed to so there's a

806
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,399
responder that we've actually

807
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:48,159
set up where you can click here and

808
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,720
um and blacklist that domain with an

809
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,320
umbrella and then you actually have a

810
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,520
reference point

811
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,919
to why the domain was blacklisted and

812
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,520
who's actually done it so

813
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,919
there's there's a case attributing to it

814
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,640
so our next steps are to actually expose

815
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,480
some of this data

816
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,600
to areas like our service support team

817
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,200
where if someone calls in saying they

818
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,120
can't access a certain resource

819
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,320
the service team is based able to query

820
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,320
this data and able to say

821
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,640
that this was blocked for this reason so

822
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,399
it's always good to be able to

823
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,120
give people feedback on why something is

824
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,080
is blocked

825
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,000
and the next is to actually expand this

826
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,200
to appliances

827
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,279
that we don't have responders for

828
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,559
already so

829
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,039
um we hoping to get to a point where we

830
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:33,760
have

831
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,200
a central uh repository to have all

832
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,279
these indicators rather than

833
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,960
uh blocking different things in

834
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,880
different appliances and and never going

835
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,799
back and revisiting them

836
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,480
so um that's pretty much

837
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,440
it uh the end of my presentation i just

838
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,720
have a few minutes

839
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,360
for everyone for questions so if you

840
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,799
have any questions if

841
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,880
any questions have come through i'm

842
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,679
happy to answer

843
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,799
do you have any questions first of all

844
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:13,120
um

845
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,880
i'd like everyone to thank dushan for

846
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,240
informing an interesting talk on what

847
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:19,440
they're doing at deakin university

848
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,880
so far we haven't actually had any

849
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,480
questions come through the app but

850
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,240
if anybody does have any questions

851
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,240
either call out and i'll repeat them or

852
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,880
put them into the app personally i'm

853
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,679
interested in

854
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,039
how you're looking at extending what

855
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:33,919
you've already done

856
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,320
integrating with other intelligence

857
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,600
that's out there

858
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,279
things with um sending maybe your

859
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,200
service now validation

860
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,559
potentially you've already looked at the

861
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,080
way servicenow was actually now coming

862
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,760
from a deakin university address rather

863
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,279
than a servicenow address

864
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,799
but things like automated analysis of

865
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,840
dmarc authentication results against

866
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,170
pre-approved or known valid um

867
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,640
[Music]

868
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,159
private keys and signers within that

869
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,240
infrastructure and how

870
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,520
how and whether or not you're looking at

871
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,440
maybe doing that as part of your

872
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,799
automated

873
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,320
authentication validation of some of

874
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,919
these reports

875
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:12,000
or when you're looking at um some of the

876
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,760
other emails that might come into your

877
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,320
system

878
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,679
yeah so um i think

879
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:19,520
i'm sure i'm not going to make a lot of

880
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,960
friends by saying this out loud

881
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,279
but we don't really trust email that

882
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,240
much so

883
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,520
i feel like organizations or users put

884
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,000
in so much trust in email

885
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,840
that they're like oh you know dmacc is

886
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,360
going to be your silver bullet but we've

887
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,159
actually

888
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,919
found out that there are organizations

889
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:38,080
so we've had an organization

890
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,240
a couple of months ago uh that has all

891
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,080
the right uh security implementations

892
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:42,880
for their

893
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,640
um mx address but they have

894
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,480
staff whose accounts were compromised

895
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,559
and we're sending phishing emails

896
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,200
so how do you stop that so i think

897
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,159
putting trust

898
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,519
into the actual workflow itself is

899
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,039
is hard so what we're trying to do

900
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,200
within the my organization at least

901
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,919
is to try and shift the approach and to

902
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:05,440
to basically say

903
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:08,080
um from deakin university just like

904
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,840
banks do from deakin university you're

905
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,720
not going to get an email to change your

906
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,880
payroll information so you're not going

907
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,200
to get an email to action a certain

908
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,799
thing or share your credit card

909
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,080
information so

910
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,679
that's the sort of education that we

911
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,679
actually want to give to our end users

912
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,440
rather than saying oh this is how you

913
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,440
actually trust an email this is how you

914
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,360
don't trust an email

915
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,000
that would be my approach and i'm sure

916
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,880
other people will have different views

917
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,279
so what uh what are the challenges that

918
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:38,480
you experience when it comes to

919
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:42,480
prioritizing which use cases to

920
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:45,200
perform first or to automate first

921
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,880
that's that's a really good question

922
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,200
um i think the way we've actually done

923
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,640
that we've looked at a few different

924
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,440
things

925
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,440
so uh we have a very mature um

926
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,039
um okay we we call it a grc function but

927
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,880
we have have a very mature

928
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,600
way of uh identifying risks and

929
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,039
registering risks in

930
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,399
a centralized risk register so

931
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,320
which task it prioritizes from a

932
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,080
business perspective on what needs to be

933
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:12,960
addressed

934
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,760
so we are using those risks so the over

935
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:16,720
sharing permission

936
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,880
is a good good example where that was

937
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,200
actually identified as a business risk

938
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,320
and it was it was a medium to high

939
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,000
business risk that we were wanting to

940
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,559
address

941
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:27,919
and that's how we prioritize that

942
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,760
automation there

943
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,279
we've got a few people interested in uh

944
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,880
why aren't using splunk to bring it all

945
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,640
together

946
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,919
uh cost i think we

947
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,360
we're trying to keep it as lean as

948
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,440
possible we know that the tool sets that

949
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,559
we're using

950
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:46,240
um will we will have uh instances where

951
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,679
we will hit

952
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,320
a brick wall and we would want to mature

953
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,039
enough but

954
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,960
this is a starting point for us we want

955
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,120
to start somewhere we want to be able to

956
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:58,159
uh show value in in automation and

957
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:58,960
orchestration

958
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,159
and that hopefully will give us the

959
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,320
uh give us what we need to to get splunk

960
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,640
or whatever tool on board

961
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,799
okay so somebody else is asking what was

962
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,399
the platform you used to search

963
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,840
and uh delete emails from office 365

964
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,039
we use a product from no before called

965
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,840
fish er it's been really good for us

966
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,799
because the

967
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,559
the one good thing that it actually does

968
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,320
really well is if you

969
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,080
run phishing campaigns through the same

970
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,600
portal um

971
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,840
it does not send those phishing campaign

972
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,640
emails to your analyst review

973
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,200
the user gets a pop-up saying thanks for

974
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,640
reporting the phishing email and the

975
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,000
email gets deleted that's

976
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,240
it so it's a good end-to-end solution

977
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,080
okay just going through some of these

978
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,080
other questions here

979
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,760
somebody's asking how do you enrich your

980
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,080
data and iocs to keep automation from

981
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,439
blocking legitimate domains

982
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,480
it is a challenge i know it's not an

983
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,760
easy answer

984
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,559
um it is a challenge we've just made

985
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,080
sure that our analysts are trained

986
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,080
enough to be able to identify

987
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,079
uh which ones are legit domains and

988
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,359
which ones aren't

989
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,760
uh we have been looking recently on some

990
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,359
of the white lists that are available on

991
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:14,239
miss

992
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:17,520
miss that we can use to identify those

993
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,440
microsoft ips and stuff but they're not

994
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,879
really up to date

995
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:24,480
so we're trying the best we can i guess

996
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,960
so with your unrealistic travel

997
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,760
validation

998
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,079
and usage of those login statistics are

999
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,918
you both alerting the sock and the end

1000
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:32,639
user that

1001
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,879
they're having unrealistic travel yeah

1002
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:36,159
at this stage

1003
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,159
um at this stage we basically decided

1004
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,599
that we will work through

1005
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,199
to our mfa roll out and revisit

1006
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,839
the issues so in the past we've had a

1007
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,679
lot of account compromises in the staff

1008
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:48,480
and student

1009
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,199
remains when we didn't have multi-factor

1010
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:51,918
roles

1011
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,679
and i feel like that's a better way of

1012
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,918
solving the problem rather than

1013
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:03,839
alerting users

1014
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,960
you
