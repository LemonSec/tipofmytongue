1
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:38,879
okay

2
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,200
i hope you had it all had a good lunch

3
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,480
um next up is

4
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,120
simon cowley he's a principal cyber

5
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,160
security officer

6
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,160
at the department of health victoria

7
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,840
i've done a lot of good work

8
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,120
um with ulcert over the years and he's

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,640
here to talk about medical device

10
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,480
security challenges

11
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,160
and practical solutions and i'm sure

12
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,760
there's no short challenges there

13
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,879
yeah there is a few all right well thank

14
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:03,600
you very

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,360
very much everyone for having me speak

16
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,280
today um

17
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,240
so i'm happy to just spell some nips and

18
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,520
provide some practical

19
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,240
solutions in uh this particular area of

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,119
security

21
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,360
um i also could re-title this

22
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,320
presentation

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,000
um medical device security uh what you

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,720
um may not want to know about but need

25
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,400
to really know about

26
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,720
so let's get started so i'm going to be

27
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,759
going to start from

28
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:31,840
basics here because i know that a lot of

29
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,840
people may not be aware what a medical

30
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,840
device really is

31
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,200
it's a regulated health care

32
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,759
uh technology used everywhere um they

33
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,079
use for the diagnosis

34
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,680
prevention treatment of disease and

35
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,960
injury and uh there's many makes and

36
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,920
types and thousands of devices out there

37
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,159
in healthcare um

38
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,799
who's got a fitbit or one of those

39
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,200
devices that send all your data to some

40
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,000
type of

41
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,840
data ocean somewhere um yes so

42
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,960
do you think it's a medical device

43
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,399
no it's not um it's pretty good about

44
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,680
doing quite accurate uh by biometric

45
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,520
and bio biological um data gathering

46
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,920
but it's not a medical device because if

47
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,680
they wanted to regulate that device make

48
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,800
it regulated you'd probably have to add

49
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,440
a one or

50
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,760
a zero at least to the cost of that

51
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,720
device

52
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,840
medical device is actually quite

53
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,120
expensive because they actually got to

54
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,319
go through a very

55
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,440
rigorous regulatory process to

56
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,480
ensure that they're safe for and and can

57
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,760
be used in a clinical environment

58
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,040
all right so here we go this is a um

59
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,000
nice shiny looking operating theater uh

60
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,480
this is stock photo uh

61
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,319
looks really swish got some pretty cool

62
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,760
tech there

63
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,440
these are all the connected medical

64
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,840
devices in this room

65
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,239
surgical microscopes x-ray systems

66
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,480
ultrasound systems connecting to packs

67
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,040
at picture archiving and communication

68
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,480
system that's a

69
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,560
basically a massive data storage array

70
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,159
one of the earliest

71
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,040
um uh integrated medical systems in a

72
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:13,680
hospital

73
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,080
that stores your medical imaging you've

74
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,080
got a electro surgical generator there

75
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,519
that actually cuts tissue

76
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,760
cuts so people open with electrical

77
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,879
surgical current

78
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,560
you can do software updates that with a

79
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,120
laptop that computer

80
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,560
that a biomedical engineer can bring

81
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,239
into the room

82
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,000
um pretty critical

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,400
piece of equipment and you want to make

84
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,799
sure that that software update is uh

85
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,440
a nice trusted source uh endospee

86
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,319
systems

87
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,400
and the anaesthetic workstation so when

88
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,760
you're having a surgical procedure

89
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,879
that's the thing that's actually keeping

90
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,840
you breathing

91
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,840
and making sure you don't die and keeps

92
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,680
you that that nice sweet

93
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,720
bit from being awake anesthetized and

94
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,840
brain dead so um

95
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,760
pretty important machine it's driven by

96
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,959
a very very

97
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,319
uh well-trained professional but that

98
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,760
is the device that is interconnected and

99
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,799
is doing your ventilation for you and

100
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:11,280
also

101
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,959
deal believing you an anesthetic agent

102
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,160
so i'm going to take this time to sort

103
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,680
of just let's look at a few medical

104
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,040
devices

105
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,358
what they do and what's under the hood

106
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,120
so this is a patient monitor

107
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,639
so this these are used right for our

108
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,160
hospitals this is what monitors your

109
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,880
vital signs

110
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,360
your ecg your heart your heart rate your

111
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,560
blood pressure your

112
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,400
your oxygen saturation and

113
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,560
they're attached on wide scale networks

114
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,680
in hospitals

115
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,040
they connect to multiple hospital

116
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,520
systems and they

117
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,199
uh integrate with a lot of systems as

118
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,639
well so

119
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,960
let's have a look under the hood they're

120
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,160
actually pretty good

121
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,440
security-wise um i've tried to do some

122
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,880
colored dots here to sort of indicate

123
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,000
what's really good and what

124
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,440
yeah you could got to be aware of but

125
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,680
you can control it with other means so

126
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,440
those patient monitors run a proprietary

127
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,039
operating system real-time operating

128
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:05,600
system

129
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,880
it's not as challenging not as

130
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,320
much of a threat surface as say a

131
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,840
windows operating system or something

132
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:12,639
like that

133
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,160
uh the manufacturers typically harden

134
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,840
these out of the box

135
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,000
and they're installed on large scales

136
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,360
and hospitals so that means you can

137
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,039
really do the economy as a scale you can

138
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:22,639
put maybe put a dedicated network

139
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:23,680
infrastructure

140
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,039
or even if you're using the hospital

141
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,800
infrastructure it's installed

142
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,960
in a very controlled manner there's a

143
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,160
lot of

144
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,240
60 100 page documents on the network

145
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,000
architecture that should be used

146
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,360
because it's not about being secure it's

147
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,880
actually about making sure that these do

148
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,160
the job and

149
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,240
if a life critical alarm sends from

150
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,919
patient monitor to a central station

151
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:42,880
actually gets there

152
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,440
because it's someone's life and death uh

153
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,479
associated with it

154
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,759
but the things to be aware of that they

155
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,840
could be running n plus one enterprise

156
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,199
two hopefully understand my math there

157
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,800
but basically they're always running

158
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,840
one or two steps behind of what is the

159
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,759
current operating system

160
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,160
and they run 24 hours a day and seven

161
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,000
days a week so it might be hard to patch

162
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,880
them

163
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,520
not impossible but a bit more difficult

164
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,080
at

165
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,919
um unfortunately i do get often

166
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,360
installed with the factory default

167
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,800
credentials so

168
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,840
um got to watch that one arterial blood

169
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,280
gas analyzer this is

170
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,600
a single medical device that you might

171
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,880
just put in one

172
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,120
spot of the hospital a couple of key

173
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,319
areas but you wouldn't probably put the

174
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,000
minions on the same scale as a patient

175
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,280
monitoring system and

176
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,639
patient monitors um they're a little bit

177
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,479
more

178
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,720
challenging because when you do things

179
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,560
once or twice you may not do it to the

180
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,919
same

181
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,759
level that you can do on economies of

182
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,960
scale when you're doing a large whale

183
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,680
system

184
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,120
and so you often see these things just

185
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,880
check push in the corner

186
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,560
ticket gets to send to the it department

187
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,240
get it on the network it could be just

188
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,000
sitting on the corporate environment

189
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,280
and people don't really know or

190
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,880
understand much about it so it's

191
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,319
actually

192
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,720
a little little thing on your network

193
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,800
you know now i know much about

194
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,160
and right for the picking and

195
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,919
yes they have been picked

196
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,240
now this is where we get into the um the

197
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,759
era of implantable medical devices so

198
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,319
um these people get a bit afraid of

199
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,120
these things

200
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,240
um appliable medical devices um

201
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,560
have been around for a long time

202
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,160
pacemakers have been around since the

203
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,599
1960s

204
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,800
the royal melbourne hospital where i

205
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,039
used to work was one of the first places

206
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:26,800
in australia to actually develop and

207
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,240
design and implant

208
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,520
a cardiac pacemaker into a person uh the

209
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,039
department i used to work for actually

210
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:33,520
used

211
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,560
actually made these by hand um a

212
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,680
clinical engineering department at the

213
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,199
royal melbourne hospital

214
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,360
so they've been around for a long time

215
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,360
so they know what risk is

216
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,840
uh and what the challenge is and and uh

217
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,120
in that response

218
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,720
but then these devices are quite modern

219
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,160
now and actually communicate with your

220
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,240
phone you can phone and provides the

221
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,599
patient with information about the

222
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,280
device and also can

223
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,840
connect to a base station in the home

224
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,400
environment

225
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,560
sending telemetry back to your

226
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,919
cardiologist

227
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,680
as well and

228
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,680
people would think that they would be

229
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,360
quite risky you bet that they're not

230
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,800
they're actually quite secure

231
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,560
because they have to be because they're

232
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,080
in some quiet someone

233
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,199
and they have and they might be

234
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,039
connected to the wild wild west

235
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,960
but the manufacturers have to get this

236
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,440
right

237
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,240
and they do and cyber security is one of

238
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,680
other risks that a medical device

239
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,440
manufacturer needs to manage

240
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,840
and they know how to manage risk because

241
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,200
it's a whole lot of different thing to

242
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,958
making like a fitbit

243
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,679
to putting inside someone and making it

244
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,440
work for 10 years

245
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,240
in a corrosive environment and making

246
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,839
sure that it doesn't have to come out

247
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,160
any other time in 10 years and it comes

248
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,839
out in a controlled manner it's not an

249
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:48,640
emergency

250
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,480
procedure these people are involved in

251
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,080
coordinated vulnerability disclosure

252
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,920
programs they tell people when there's

253
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,200
an issue

254
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,800
they tell everybody that they need to

255
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,519
get get in and get a patch done all

256
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,920
and they are also always monitoring

257
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,680
their landscape in this regard

258
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,760
never heard of incident cyber security

259
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,279
incident on a device

260
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,440
of this nature it doesn't mean it can't

261
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,640
happen but

262
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,480
never haven't ended for everyone and

263
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,720
i've looked far and wide

264
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,720
so medical devices have an evolving

265
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,000
threat landscape

266
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,600
there's more and more with things we

267
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,160
connect up

268
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,279
we create this this emergent threat

269
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,720
landscape

270
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,760
but medical devices have two issues

271
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,040
they can be comp by connecting them up

272
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,519
they're exposed to an environment that

273
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,320
allows

274
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,519
them to be compromised like

275
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,360
unintended malware transversing onto the

276
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,600
micro devices however they can also be a

277
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,080
target

278
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,640
because of their vulnerabilities and you

279
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,040
used as a leverage point

280
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,560
so many may ask why would you

281
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,200
want to attack medical devices but um i

282
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,720
was sad to say that unfortunately some

283
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,279
people just like to watch the world burn

284
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,360
um there's financial political gain for

285
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,160
um i've been able to identify and access

286
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,440
information

287
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,640
um uh from these the the the data that's

288
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,160
in distorting these devices and i t

289
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,279
systems

290
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,399
um malicious alteration or denial of

291
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,279
service

292
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,800
to a hospital is another vector a

293
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,360
vector of motivation as a form of cyber

294
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,800
warfare

295
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,399
wild scale disruption of health care

296
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,880
services by making medical devices

297
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:31,760
unavailable

298
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,440
so don't know service attack would be

299
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,959
good examples uh

300
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,720
for that but also inoperable and that's

301
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,240
where it gets really uh

302
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,480
nasty where ransomware or some of the

303
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,279
destructive mel

304
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,399
that you can see in the industrial

305
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,800
control sector could

306
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,760
you know brick a three million dollar

307
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,120
mri machine

308
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,440
and higher education if you did that

309
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,880
you'd probably take you

310
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,320
weeks to restore it um and that's if you

311
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,560
had the parts in the country do it

312
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,880
and of course the curiosity and prestige

313
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,600
that may

314
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,240
be awarded to some threat actor by being

315
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,399
able to do this sort of stuff

316
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,360
so what kind of fun things are happening

317
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,959
in healthcare and what are our threats

318
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,480
well ransomware is

319
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,959
the threat the most highly prevalent

320
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,360
threat in health care at this time

321
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,320
um we had the first attribution of a

322
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,519
death

323
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,399
of a patient in germany in september the

324
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,079
prosecutors in germany did actually

325
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,079
explore this but they didn't find a case

326
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,320
to answer but it does actually bring up

327
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,959
the case that this patient was bypassed

328
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,560
from a hospital and it was compromised

329
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,480
by a ransomware attack and was unable to

330
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:36,880
deliver

331
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,440
it all their services it's a bit of a

332
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,079
could have

333
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,200
if it didn't if they went where they're

334
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,079
treated at the time would they have been

335
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:46,959
better outcome

336
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,440
don't know it's all you know could yes

337
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,160
maybe no

338
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,200
don't know but it has been attributed in

339
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,399
that regard

340
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,720
uh the u.s got smashed in 2020 with

341
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,760
ransomware

342
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,519
uh there was an alert that came out in

343
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,279
october that we then communicated with

344
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,800
our health services

345
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,920
in australia uh or victoria for uh

346
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,279
where i live um about uh

347
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,680
imminent ransomware attacks against uh

348
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,680
from information on the dark web

349
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,000
and uh yeah they did live up to their

350
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,360
what they were planning to do

351
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,000
um and uh yeah they were responsible to

352
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,720
see any players

353
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,839
center the tax in 20 in october 2020.

354
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:24,959
and in this year we

355
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,320
our acsc is highlighted in their sector

356
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,000
snapshot that

357
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,040
ransomware is currently the most

358
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,399
significant cyber crime threat to

359
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,040
australian healthcare

360
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,480
so um

361
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,760
this is going back to what i was saying

362
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,000
about you know that arterial blood gas

363
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,519
machine or that forgotten device a

364
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,279
single device in a hospital that people

365
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,399
have not really

366
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,480
you know keeping an eye on yeah well

367
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,920
threat actors can take that

368
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,079
and this is an example of one that has

369
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:53,279
this is a

370
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,800
advanced persistent threat where a

371
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,320
threat actor is actually leveraged off

372
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,079
the medical device with the

373
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,399
operating system that hasn't been

374
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,560
patched for a while or is running

375
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,200
xp when everybody's moved on and use

376
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,000
that as a

377
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,720
easy point to get into and then work on

378
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,480
orchestrating attack which then

379
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,440
exfiltrates data from a pax network from

380
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,959
all the medical imaging

381
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,480
and radiology reports

382
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,000
so far mostly been uh targeted for data

383
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,360
expectation but

384
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,399
could be easily exploited pool for other

385
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,440
notorious means so

386
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,360
uh security controls can be challenging

387
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,959
for medical devices

388
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,720
so what we have is we have a regulated

389
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,240
technology and

390
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,320
what you need to be aware of with

391
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,760
medical devices is

392
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,199
that manufacturer has gone through a

393
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,519
very extensive regulatory process to get

394
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:43,920
that

395
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,959
medical device approved for human use

396
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,360
you can't go in and start putting agents

397
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,880
and any malware products and stuff that

398
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,279
you've got free enterprise on it because

399
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,959
what if you put that on and it caused

400
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,160
that medical device not to function

401
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:56,800
properly

402
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,199
you would actually be potentially liable

403
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,240
and

404
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,639
calls for the patient harm that may be

405
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,560
caused by that scenario

406
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,480
so you do have to be careful it doesn't

407
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,399
mean you can't do stuff in that space

408
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,519
but

409
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,680
it's something i've got to be aware of

410
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,519
there's such a diversity of medical

411
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,320
devices

412
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,440
in healthcare you

413
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,600
all go out in it and standardize your

414
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:20,959
desktops and your laptops and your

415
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,240
operating systems

416
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,560
medical devices have every single

417
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,480
operating system and version and

418
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,880
hardware that you can think of because

419
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,480
medical devices are bought for their

420
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,880
clinical benefit and what

421
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,639
they can do for those patients or for

422
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,000
that cohort

423
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,760
they buy but they're not buying it for

424
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,600
standardizing of operations

425
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,440
not even on their radar so you have to

426
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,680
deal with that that's just what it is

427
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,519
they all have high up time retirements

428
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,040
no different industrial control

429
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,600
you've got to have they're run 24 7. you

430
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,199
just got to work with that

431
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,120
and and the legacy debt you're always

432
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,959
going to have in health care

433
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,279
medical devices that have got like a 10

434
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,160
15 euro

435
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,600
15 year life span with we

436
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,040
like for a like capital piece of

437
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,120
equipment that's built into a room

438
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,240
and you're gonna have to deal with that

439
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,399
because you can't really go out and just

440
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,120
suddenly just

441
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,120
put in your operating system because

442
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,240
it's not supported

443
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,120
so this guidance security has developed

444
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,279
over the last few years in

445
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,800
medical devices here's some here

446
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,800
and some have tried to apply this um

447
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,399
into healthcare organizations um

448
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,320
some in the us but with extensive

449
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,839
resources it's like they've tried to

450
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:34,240
play

451
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,120
nist and nist is great and i do like

452
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,079
nissan i like the

453
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,800
the five functions of this but applying

454
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
that to medical devices is like

455
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,639
um trying to use a forest to fund

456
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,670
the wood in the trees so um

457
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,800
[Music]

458
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,000
it is it is get its place but it is a

459
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,279
very broad

460
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,680
control control framework that is not

461
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,839
written from medical devices up

462
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,000
and the essentially it's actually

463
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,199
interesting little footnote for

464
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:04,639
essential light here is that

465
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,079
it's actually featured in the tga

466
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,000
guidance as a foundation

467
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,720
piece so we've got some good stuff here

468
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,399
here in australia

469
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,920
and medical device manufacturers are

470
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,120
embedding cyber security in their

471
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,480
products they have been for quite some

472
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,399
time it's not a new thing

473
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,600
and they now

474
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,279
got life cycle approaches to cyber

475
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,839
security they participate in global

476
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,759
information sharing networks to share

477
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:28,959
their best practices

478
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,680
and develop new practices and security

479
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,120
researchers are spending their time to

480
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,800
poke into medical devices and see what

481
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,240
they can actually

482
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,040
do and get to and then disclose those

483
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,600
with

484
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,279
economics manufacturers this is a really

485
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,800
good

486
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,800
piece in germany late last year the

487
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,079
report came out called

488
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,120
manumed manipulation of medical devices

489
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,600
and they funded some dedicated security

490
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,480
research

491
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,240
and found a whole lot of vulnerabilities

492
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,000
in devices which was then shared

493
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,440
with the medical device manufacturers

494
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,759
that participate in that program

495
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,240
and this amazing things came out of it

496
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,600
but really good work read if you ever

497
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,240
look at that

498
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,760
go out and buy it mannymed so

499
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,959
why am i talking about industrial

500
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,280
control well

501
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,640
um medieval advices but um

502
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,720
i actually worked in industrial control

503
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,880
then i worked in biomedical engineering

504
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,280
and then

505
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,559
now i'm working in cyber and

506
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,760
healthcare needs to look through other

507
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,119
industries for their guidance and

508
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,720
controls and medical devices

509
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,200
and that's where i got them from so i

510
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,039
see industrial control and medical

511
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,799
devices have many parallels

512
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:35,200
such as legacy operating systems their

513
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,960
critical infrastructure

514
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,160
if you do something wrong with medical

515
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,840
devices you do something wrong with

516
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,000
industrial control infrastructure

517
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,280
um you can cause harm to people

518
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,320
and to the environment and you've got uh

519
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,160
higher up time requirements in these

520
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,840
these technologies

521
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,320
uh and and also there's a standards and

522
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,760
regulatory compliance that you have to

523
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,240
work

524
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,799
under as well so that little photo there

525
00:17:58,799 --> 00:17:59,679
is um just a

526
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,520
footnote to um some of the stuff i used

527
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,039
to work on that's a rosemount system

528
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:03,760
three

529
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,679
uh industrial control system was built

530
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:07,919
in like the 70s or 80s

531
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,480
there's a few things that would survive

532
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,919
a nuclear

533
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,600
holocaust that would be cockroaches and

534
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,760
the rosemount system three

535
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,360
um or proprietary hardware so it was

536
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,120
like completely bulletproof

537
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,440
um so these are the controls that i

538
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,720
developed from the industrial control

539
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,200
sector

540
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,720
and from my own workings as a biomedical

541
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,360
engineer

542
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,400
number one is the collaboration between

543
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,679
clinical engineering

544
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:35,679
which is the discipline of biomedical

545
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,120
engineering but

546
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,679
being applied in a healthcare and

547
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,200
hospital environment the people who

548
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,080
manage

549
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,280
maintain and procure

550
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:47,120
and support medical technology in a

551
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,400
healthcare environment

552
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,520
so to achieve um

553
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,360
successful mitigation of cybersecurity

554
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,720
risk in healthcare you need a

555
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,799
collaboration between the it department

556
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:57,360
i t

557
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,880
security professionals and and

558
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,640
biomedical engineers or clinical

559
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,400
engineering

560
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,960
both them bring important important work

561
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,240
to the table

562
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,440
sharing and share knowledge and and we

563
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,240
can work

564
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,000
collaboratively what can and can't be

565
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,480
done to protect the devices and

566
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,640
organizations globally recognized this

567
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,160
uh over a decade ago

568
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,400
the healthcare technology alliance here

569
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,679
is a formation of

570
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,520
hymns the australian the american

571
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,720
um council of clinical engineering and

572
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,200
um this association advancement of

573
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,720
medical instrumentation another us

574
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,840
organization

575
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,440
recognized this over a decade ago that

576
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,120
they needed this collaboration

577
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,720
to drive cyber security

578
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,840
uh patch management now patching is hard

579
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,840
with medical devices but accessories

580
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,400
type

581
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,760
attack unpatched systems this needs to

582
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,919
be made part of the medical device's

583
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,000
plan maintenance cycle

584
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,320
so if there's any biomedical engineers

585
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,840
listening you do plan maintenance

586
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,960
already

587
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:02,480
medical software patching is your new

588
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,120
and should be now your patch part of

589
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,640
your manual patch

590
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,000
plan maintenance activities like if

591
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,640
you're changing a filters or batteries

592
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,159
on a medical device

593
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,559
like in a ventilator you also go and

594
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:16,159
patch the software

595
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,280
as well also use best practices as

596
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,159
getting where

597
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:21,919
where you download that from trusted

598
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,600
sources and

599
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,240
if you have to use a laptop to go and

600
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,440
download

601
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,280
an update to a medical device and sure

602
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,120
that laptop's got its own

603
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,400
uh very strong anti-malware protections

604
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,240
and other things on that device

605
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,000
you don't want to take that laptop into

606
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,440
a trusted network

607
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,840
and drop malware because your laptop's

608
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,960
just a piece of

609
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,960
garbage reduce your attack surface

610
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,280
you isolate your medical devices from

611
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,360
untrusted networks particularly internet

612
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,120
there are so many medical devices have

613
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,799
no business being talking to the

614
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,080
internet

615
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,880
turn it off you really just then cut

616
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,240
down your run

617
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,039
your your threat surface by such a

618
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,039
significant amount by doing that

619
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,960
only allow real-time communications when

620
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,360
you need to and make sure it's essential

621
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,200
if it has no business talking to

622
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,640
anything else don't

623
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,960
connect it we like connecting things up

624
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,960
but why if it doesn't have a business

625
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,679
requirement

626
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,120
don't do it also then build a defendable

627
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:21,919
environment

628
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,440
so limit your limit if you have to

629
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,039
connect it up

630
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,640
limit it by using a good tech like a

631
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,520
next generation

632
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,559
firewall and um

633
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,320
talking from a very speaker before never

634
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:38,000
turn your firewall into a router

635
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,039
or none of this any any crap

636
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,520
always use it to its fullest potential

637
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:44,960
don't put it in and don't actually

638
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,559
use the annie packet and malware

639
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,400
inspection capabilities yeah

640
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,120
yeah use it to you turn it turn it up to

641
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,240
11.

642
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,200
and um also segment your medical devices

643
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,120
in a logical enclave based on either the

644
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,960
make or the modality so you might have a

645
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,559
patient monitoring system

646
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,919
makes sense vendor x put that in one

647
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,440
network vendor and i put that in one

648
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,240
network

649
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,000
segment and then your packs might be its

650
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,120
own network because you've got a mix of

651
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,880
medical devices and other

652
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,679
non-medical systems and workstations

653
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,200
that need to talk together so but you

654
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,000
still put it in an

655
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,559
enclave of its own by doing this

656
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,640
if one of them gets compromised you

657
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,919
don't get uh

658
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:26,320
all compromised it's about being you're

659
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,919
going to get pwned but how prone do you

660
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:29,919
want to be

661
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:33,360
and manage your authentication so every

662
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,919
adversary is after high privileged

663
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,600
accounts and access

664
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,840
use mfa where you can reduce the

665
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,520
privileges to those

666
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,919
that are only necessary for the duties

667
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:44,640
principal

668
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,919
least privileged and

669
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,360
i could strongly recommend having

670
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,960
separate credentials and trust draws

671
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,120
between your medical device networks

672
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,000
and you and your enterprise or corporate

673
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,720
network

674
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,559
because again it's back to it you're

675
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,240
going to get capone but how pained you

676
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,200
want to be

677
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,919
so you might lose some stuff that's like

678
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,600
like on your jaw corporate network in a

679
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,039
ransomware attack but do you

680
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,200
really want to let that also happen to

681
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,240
you your

682
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,280
core critical infrastructure

683
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,480
and that is something you've got to

684
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,799
really think about there

685
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,039
implement security access every medical

686
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,320
device vendor out there is going to say

687
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,840
i need remote access to do

688
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,960
x y and z is it really essential

689
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,880
um this is one of the things that i'm

690
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,559
going to try to

691
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,360
break this uh uh with with the program

692
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,559
in victoria

693
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,720
because i feel that many that medical

694
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,159
device vendors have come in and

695
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,520
said that they need access and really

696
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,520
it's not essential because what it does

697
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,200
it just creates another attack surface

698
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,799
that may not necessarily need to be

699
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:43,679
there

700
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,080
for an essential function but if you do

701
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,279
have to do it

702
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,159
do it securely encrypt it and don't make

703
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,240
it persistent it should actually be used

704
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:52,880
on a

705
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,679
time-based purpose you should be able to

706
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,440
be a position to say oh

707
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,480
a clinician at that mri machine in the

708
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,039
in the radiology department say i need

709
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:04,799
some support from the medical device

710
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,720
manufacturer on a particular clinical

711
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,799
issue they call them up

712
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,480
you work out who that person is and you

713
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,840
authenticate them right out of bad

714
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,640
communications

715
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,600
then you grant the access it shouldn't

716
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,000
be

717
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,840
shouldn't be difficult but it leaves you

718
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,919
that great deal

719
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,440
greater level security when it comes to

720
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,679
remote access

721
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:24,799
and then you've got to have something to

722
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,240
monitor and respond because you've got

723
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,520
to be able to monitor

724
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,880
if you do the segmentation and the

725
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,840
and and uh you can then monitor those

726
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,679
control points of medical devices very

727
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:36,559
well

728
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,880
and they have a very very very small

729
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,120
operating range of what they actually do

730
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,159
and don't do

731
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,760
so if you're just monitoring the the

732
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,279
very if you've got a

733
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:46,960
ability to monitor what's normal network

734
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,559
traffic everything out the

735
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,000
side that is abnormal and then you've

736
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,080
you set that up right you can have alarm

737
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,600
trigger on that and then you go and

738
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,080
send someone to go and investigate that

739
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,000
suspicious activity

740
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,600
but you've got to do that to get to that

741
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,760
point

742
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,000
and

743
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,679
there's deception technologies has a

744
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,000
place also uh in medical iq network

745
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,559
segments

746
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,039
actually provide that extra canary

747
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,960
canaries in the mind

748
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,400
and you should have a medical device

749
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,000
security incident plan

750
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,440
shouldn't be like a separate one it

751
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,880
should be incorporated into your

752
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,159
organization's

753
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,120
cyber security incident plan but you

754
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,320
will have an incident with medical

755
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,919
devices at some point you need to

756
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:30,720
actually

757
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,400
hopefully have things in place what you

758
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,320
need to to who to talk to

759
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,760
do you need to call the tga yes

760
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,880
um and uh also

761
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,520
uh report it to the tga and you also

762
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,000
have to

763
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,679
you know who's the medical advisor

764
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,200
manufacturers because you might need

765
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,559
their expertise to actually help you

766
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,840
with the insulin response recovery

767
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,799
because

768
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,279
your your hospital will not have the

769
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,120
resources within it

770
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,720
your biomedical engineering teams may

771
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,240
not have the specific knowledge for that

772
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,360
particular system

773
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,960
you need to have those people and know

774
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,039
who to call on that

775
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,799
um you've got to have backups of all

776
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,400
your stuff um

777
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,600
you've got to have and you've got to

778
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,440
have the configuration so unfortunately

779
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,440
what gets mixed with medical devices is

780
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,559
you need a

781
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,640
config to rebuild the clinical

782
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,400
configuration all that time and effort

783
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:16,960
has been

784
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,840
to tune that sys that that system in

785
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,279
that clinical environment you need to

786
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,240
have that

787
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,840
at hand to help in the research creation

788
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,960
place it's not bad at just having the

789
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,760
software

790
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,480
to restore it's actually that that that

791
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,120
tuned

792
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,880
configuration that's specific to that

793
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,480
health service and all even that

794
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,279
hospital

795
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,880
that you would lose if you had a

796
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,279
complete um

797
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,559
blow away of that system

798
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,840
so and now i'm going to talk about the

799
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,360
timeline of these controls so what i've

800
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,400
just shown you is just

801
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,120
some stuff that got adapted out of an

802
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,640
industrial control

803
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,720
um best practices in 2018.

804
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,080
so i i i actually talked about that at a

805
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,279
conference

806
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,840
when i was a biomedical engineer in 2018

807
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,760
and we took that and

808
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,880
um i had a chat with a couple of uh uh

809
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,840
someone

810
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,520
at the department by the names of james

811
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,279
fell and one of my other colleagues at

812
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,480
the royal melbourne hospital andrew

813
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,440
oldecker

814
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,760
who been working for years on medical

815
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,440
device security and what we can sort of

816
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,799
do in that space

817
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,679
and we came up with a paper on top 10

818
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:26,960
strategies for biomedical device

819
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,399
security and thought oh yeah this

820
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,000
sounds like a good thing and we just

821
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,679
sent that out for our working group

822
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,960
in victoria for cyber security uh and

823
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,799
the tga picked it up and thought it was

824
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:37,600
pretty good

825
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,640
and they went into the um tga

826
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,320
guidance for medical device security

827
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,640
that was released in

828
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,720
uh july 2019 uh and yeah

829
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,880
if you want to have a look it's it's in

830
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,399
there and

831
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,520
um so i thought well must be something

832
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,279
good about it if they wanted to use it

833
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,200
at their record as a regulator to say

834
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,880
that you know doing some of this stuff

835
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,320
is the way to go

836
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,600
so took that and in 2021 we launched

837
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,760
a medical device security program for

838
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,080
victorian public health services

839
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,640
and so we now have in victoria for the

840
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,000
health services a medical device

841
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,080
security working group

842
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,399
which meets monthly and it's a working

843
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:19,360
group that's

844
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,520
chaired and run by the health services

845
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,679
the department of health facilitates

846
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,520
but its membership consists of

847
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,600
biomedical engineers and i.t security

848
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,600
professionals from health services

849
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,279
so it's an environment to help try to

850
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,960
drive that control number one

851
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,799
ceit collaboration and um

852
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,799
uh what we're working on now is doing

853
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,720
just a baseline assessment to a control

854
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,279
set that's

855
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,720
uh seven controls that you saw before

856
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,399
and a few other things

857
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,440
um to see where we're all at

858
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,679
um

859
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,600
so the program in victoria oh i've

860
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,960
you've seen that diagram too many times

861
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,960
sorry about that um

862
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,039
that's what happens when you pull a

863
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,480
presentation together from multiple

864
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,559
sources you just keep repeating things

865
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,880
um so the program focuses on medical

866
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,320
device product life cycle

867
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,960
so it's the cradle to grave approach so

868
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,520
you

869
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,520
the regulators do their cyber security

870
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,960
and the manufacturer

871
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,279
in the matter and that we're looking at

872
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,039
the post

873
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,679
post phase of the supplies of the

874
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:24,960
manufacturing device

875
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,080
so when you procure it when you put it

876
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,679
into operation when you then

877
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:30,960
take it through the hospital and then it

878
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,720
comes into a legacy phase

879
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,080
and we're leveraging off industrial

880
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,919
control security

881
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,159
or system best practices because they've

882
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,760
wrote a really good approach to

883
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,640
to defense and depth and threat modeling

884
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,000
particularly things like the mitre

885
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,279
attack framework there's actually a

886
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,000
specific one for

887
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,200
industrial control systems and what

888
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,640
we've done is with

889
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,480
with a security program we've already

890
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,720
got a baseline control set

891
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,320
we're not going to enter the wheel we

892
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,080
put this little subset over top but it

893
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,000
links into our main control set

894
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,360
so the people who've done the work on

895
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,520
this in hospitals can then

896
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,600
see where they can leverage off that to

897
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,240
drive the medical device security

898
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,559
so we've got a practice of practice yep

899
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,360
thank you

900
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,440
there is a practice security controls

901
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,039
and we've also got a framework um

902
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,720
now in place the practice areas are

903
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,120
these are the ten practice areas so this

904
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,480
is the crate this is the cradle of the

905
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,399
grave so it's the risk management

906
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,600
the collaboration and then from

907
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,559
procurement through to asset management

908
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,240
endpoint protection yes it is a thing

909
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,399
you can do it for some medical devices

910
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,720
some manufacturers actually have

911
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,600
validated

912
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,880
things like anti-malware some of the

913
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,200
more advanced ones too um

914
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,200
in their products so you could use it

915
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,240
but they're also

916
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,480
it's about knowing what you can't and

917
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,919
where you can't put it and then having

918
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,840
that in a risk register

919
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,080
because you know then well i can't use

920
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,880
that as a tool

921
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,039
but what can i do around it to protect

922
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,399
it

923
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,799
application control is also part of

924
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,000
practice area number five important

925
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,120
protection

926
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,279
um network management that's all about

927
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,120
the stuff on

928
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,519
um you know defendable environment i've

929
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,880
talked about before

930
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,480
i identities access management

931
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,080
vulnerability management as well and

932
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,919
that's about having coordinated

933
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:18,640
management

934
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,240
voluntary management program threat

935
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,840
intelligence coming in but also

936
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,360
potentially using vulnerability scanners

937
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,120
in a controlled manner

938
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,440
and uh dealing with legacy debt and

939
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,960
legacy devices

940
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,080
as as well and having a way to deal with

941
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,919
it when you get the uh when you when

942
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:36,960
when when when you have the incident

943
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,399
so ongoing we're going to do a

944
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,799
gap analysis based on the assessment and

945
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,559
we're hoping to do our first exercise on

946
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,000
medical of a medical device cyber

947
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,600
security incident

948
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,360
uh exercise in uh late 2020

949
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:54,960
if things going well but future wise for

950
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,880
medical device security

951
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,279
um the medical devices will continue to

952
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:00,240
improve

953
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,519
as a at the device and hardware level as

954
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:05,279
manufacturers move to new platforms and

955
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:07,440
technologies uh

956
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,039
it takes a long time for medical device

957
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,559
manufacturer to move from one product to

958
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:11,279
the next

959
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,880
it takes a long time to validate the

960
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,720
next generation of technology through

961
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,000
regulatory processes

962
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,880
but it is exhilarating nowadays uh the

963
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,640
fda and other organizations

964
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,960
if the european uh organizations that do

965
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,159
uh regulation as well have tried to

966
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,720
work on those processes in that regard

967
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,399
but the driving factor for that improved

968
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:33,760
insecurity is because more medical

969
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,399
devices are leaving the home environment

970
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,080
uh the hospital environment and are in

971
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,000
the home environment so they actually

972
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,919
outside of that you can't put those

973
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,360
protections around that you could do in

974
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,840
a hospital that you can't do in the home

975
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,720
and there will always be a legacy debt

976
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,640
to manage medical devices and

977
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,720
particularly for the big expensive

978
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,840
things so

979
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,399
an mri is a three three million dollar

980
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,240
machine

981
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,240
and it costs a lot probably a good

982
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,000
proportion or more of that

983
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,080
a good chunk of that same cost per year

984
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,240
to run it's not something you can go and

985
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,120
say ah

986
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,320
i'm getting rid of it because the os is

987
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,559
obsoleting underneath it it's a very

988
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,840
expensive piece of kit

989
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,200
so you're going to have to always deal

990
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,039
with legacy at some somewhere

991
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,559
and if it's not windows 7 it'll be

992
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,600
soon wednesday 10. so um

993
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,640
it's always going to be something you're

994
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,760
going to have to work on

995
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,200
and that's just references and

996
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:39,840
yep that's it so questions

997
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,440
thanks simon and if anyone has questions

998
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,880
it's probably best to chuck it on the

999
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,480
app just so

1000
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,480
people at home can see the questions as

1001
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:51,600
well

1002
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,080
so simon are you aware of any

1003
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,840
implications or issues to medical

1004
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,880
devices

1005
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,960
as a result of recent cyber attacks in

1006
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,840
victorian health

1007
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,120
no so we've had there has been some

1008
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,320
incidents

1009
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,599
um in uh recent times there's

1010
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,079
particularly one in eastern health

1011
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:18,079
uh now there weren't any medical devices

1012
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:18,960
implicated in

1013
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:23,359
in that but um what i can say is that

1014
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,480
there are um there are components of a

1015
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:27,359
medical device

1016
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:32,078
system that you need to

1017
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,560
understand that uh and other working

1018
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,359
parts that

1019
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,119
uh can continue to compromise and a good

1020
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,359
example would be an integration engine

1021
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,839
so your medical master manufacturer will

1022
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,839
have a

1023
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,960
um a system and they have the the true

1024
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,000
medical device the

1025
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,159
funds regulated and it will talk to

1026
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,040
equipment

1027
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,560
in a centralized environment like a

1028
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,639
central working station that

1029
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,079
like my patient monitor is a great

1030
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,160
example all the telemetry from those

1031
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,280
patient models has come back to a

1032
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,520
central workstation the clinicians can

1033
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,440
look at at the staff base

1034
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,880
and there might be databases to connect

1035
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,800
to that and all of that

1036
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,240
side yeah um could be

1037
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,480
found in cyber cyber incident but it's

1038
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,400
that integration piece which connects

1039
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,079
that to electronic medical record

1040
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:21,119
or another system that that middleware

1041
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,040
uh often provided by the same medical

1042
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,960
device manufacturer but not technically

1043
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,400
a medical device because it's actually

1044
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,200
translating and

1045
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,079
removing the data it's actually you

1046
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:31,680
don't make a date you're not making

1047
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:34,720
a direct diagnostic decision

1048
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,839
off that uh the other things that can

1049
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:38,240
get

1050
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,880
compromised and the reason is is that

1051
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,079
when those get middleweights get

1052
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,640
installed they maybe get middle

1053
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,680
they maybe have the same credentials and

1054
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,800
domain level

1055
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,480
connectivity of um other systems in the

1056
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,119
in the

1057
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,440
in the organization now they're not

1058
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,720
actually that hard to restore those

1059
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,440
things

1060
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,520
because it's actually just a it's like a

1061
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,960
lift and shift sort of device it's not

1062
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,960
actually storing anything

1063
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,920
but it's an example of where back to

1064
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,359
their trust and going what

1065
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,760
if i've got a medical id network and a

1066
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,200
trust relationship in that

1067
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,880
i don't want to share that and have the

1068
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,160
same credentials that could be in a

1069
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,280
corporate environment because i know

1070
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,800
that's what's going to be

1071
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,960
hit first and someone's going to get to

1072
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,560
mainly privileges i don't want that

1073
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,280
same thing to be they're not able to to

1074
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,480
own the other devices as well

1075
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:31,200
that's the question so in addition to

1076
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:31,920
ics

1077
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,680
this seems to fit into a similar frame

1078
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,359
as pci dss

1079
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,440
is there a need to development to

1080
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,880
develop a specific industry

1081
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,400
industry-wide framework

1082
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,640
instead of more generic ones such as

1083
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,839
essential 8 or nist

1084
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,280
yeah well it could be a place to

1085
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,800
actually have a industry-specific

1086
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,560
control set and um i've actually built

1087
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,280
one because there wasn't one

1088
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,000
i mean you've got nist out there and

1089
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,200
it's great

1090
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:07,440
and the control set that i've got is

1091
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,160
based on nist and i actually the frame

1092
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:10,640
the old

1093
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,119
framework is built on the five pillars

1094
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,200
of the uh this framework and

1095
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,520
what there's a basically a diagram that

1096
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,800
we've built that

1097
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,200
what health services do what department

1098
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,400
does under those five pillars

1099
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,960
but and and really they you know there

1100
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,320
would be a place i feel that

1101
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,400
if this go and goes moves on forward

1102
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,079
that you could actually have a

1103
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,960
industry standard controls framework the

1104
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,240
tga tried that

1105
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,240
and have done that really they've it's

1106
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,839
got they've got

1107
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,440
do these things in their in their in

1108
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,280
their guidance but it

1109
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,040
it's it's it's uh

1110
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,960
you can take that pretty much as a

1111
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,119
pretty solid standard already

1112
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:54,320
but again this is really still an

1113
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,599
emerging area

1114
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,800
and more work needs to be done

1115
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,200
and um i'll just go one last question

1116
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,280
from myself

1117
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,040
when it comes to these manufacturers

1118
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,640
making these devices it's

1119
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,599
it's highly regulated but um you know

1120
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,040
most of the stuff that's currently

1121
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,119
in places as you said the older devices

1122
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,359
of up to 15 years

1123
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,440
is the newer regulation starting to

1124
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,119
target stuff like

1125
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,079
not being able to implement a device

1126
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:22,640
with

1127
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,520
default credentials in terms of like is

1128
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,280
the regulation targeting more

1129
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,200
implementation instead of just the

1130
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,359
manufacturing of the device

1131
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:34,880
yeah so that's where a lot has happened

1132
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,400
and quite quickly in cyber security

1133
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,320
medical devices because

1134
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,920
um the best best opportunity to

1135
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,200
influence a change is when it is in the

1136
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,040
the design phase and embed the security

1137
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,079
from

1138
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:51,200
in in the device from day one and

1139
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,200
that's where the regulator regulatory

1140
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,440
agencies globally have been

1141
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:59,520
um uh able to really drive that is that

1142
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,359
cyber security is one of the risks that

1143
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:03,119
is par that it needs to be managed as

1144
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,880
part of the essential principles for any

1145
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,640
medical device

1146
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,119
you can't put it into the you can't put

1147
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:10,240
it in

1148
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,280
willingly with a massive security holes

1149
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:13,599
and

1150
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,640
those those things because and

1151
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,200
the manufacturers of their medical

1152
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,000
devices also

1153
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,760
are rather risk adverse and they they

1154
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,200
understand risk

1155
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:26,320
um more than many of you may think

1156
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,119
because

1157
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,520
these things are used on people they

1158
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,440
make life-saving

1159
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,720
functions or decisions or report

1160
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,920
life-saving information

1161
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,000
so they've managed risk for a long time

1162
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,040
in a whole lot of different other

1163
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,240
factors with medical devices

1164
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:46,560
in terms of quality and

1165
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,040
methods to report and recall devices and

1166
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,760
such

1167
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,040
cyber security is just another one of

1168
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,079
them they just have to put on their

1169
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,640
radars they've got the processes there

1170
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,560
and it's just about making sure that

1171
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,680
they cover

1172
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,200
cover all the bases and have the people

1173
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,119
because again

1174
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:02,720
when you look at cyber security you've

1175
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,880
got you've got this small group

1176
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,200
and then you start distilling it down

1177
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,400
when it comes down to people who are

1178
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:08,880
actually

1179
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,880
doing stuff in medical device security

1180
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,240
at the

1181
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,880
regulator manufacturer and

1182
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,079
state and department level very very

1183
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:22,960
small number of people

1184
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,720
okay get one more round of applause for

1185
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,250
simon

1186
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,520
[Applause]

1187
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,640
thank you so
