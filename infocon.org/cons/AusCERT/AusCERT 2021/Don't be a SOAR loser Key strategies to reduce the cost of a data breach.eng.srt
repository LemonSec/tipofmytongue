session

23
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,239
um just quick housekeeping in terms of

24
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,280
questions please

25
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,440
lodge them via the app because i'll be

26
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,200
moderating that and asking the questions

27
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,640
at the end when we get to it and we can

28
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,159
all upvote them and

29
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,360
you know get the questions in that we

30
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,519
want to get in but now we have ashwin

00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,840
who's the cyber security evangelist at

33
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,519
checkpoint to tell you about how

34
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,200
well key strategies to reducing the cost

35
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,280
of a data breach welcome ashwin

36
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,040
thank you well hello i hope

37
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,200
you have all been enjoying the session

38
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,400
so far

39
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,879
if we haven't met before my name is

40
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,480
ashwin ram i'm part of the office of the

41
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,439
cto at

42
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,599
checkpoint and it is my absolute

43
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,040
pleasure to be sharing

44
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,440
his insights and strategies on how to

45
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,160
reduce the cost of a data breach

46
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,520
now much of what i will be sharing with

47
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,440
you are recommendations that we've been

48
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,880
making for a very long time but it's

49
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,400
really good to see that

50
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,240
independent studies are now validating

51
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,240
our our message

52
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,919
so the insights that i will be sharing

53
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,600
with you are from various different

54
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,240
sources

55
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,280
the first one is from the 2020 cost of a

56
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,560
data breach report

57
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,040
now for this the pointman institute

58
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,840
carried out

59
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,240
a uh in-depth study by interviewing more

60
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,560
than

61
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,840
3200 individuals from

62
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,680
524 organizations that

63
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,360
had been breached between august 2019

64
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,720
and april 2020 in

65
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,400
this study well my view on this study is

66
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:04,800
that

67
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,960
it provides some very very good insights

68
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,400
that we should be using

69
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,400
to either formulate or update cyber

70
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,479
resilience strategies

71
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,120
now the study gives us insights into the

72
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,199
top attack vectors that was being used

73
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,560
by threat actors

74
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,560
so i think it's important that we talk

75
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,000
about this

76
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,880
and understand where the failures were

77
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,520
so that

78
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,720
you guys can prevent these attacks

79
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,840
i will also share with you key factors

80
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,240
that

81
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,639
influence the cost of a data breach

82
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:35,280
which

83
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,039
must be part of your cyber resilience

84
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,120
strategy now at checkpoint we have an

85
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,560
insulin response team as well

86
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,919
and last year we responded to more than

87
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:44,960
three and a half

88
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,000
thousand calls for help globally from

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,600
organizations that were either under an

90
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,080
attack

91
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,800
or had just been breached so i think

92
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,919
it's important to

93
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,720
learn the lessons from our response team

94
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,680
because

95
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,120
they see what is working and what is not

96
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,960
now everyone knows that sock teams play

97
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,800
a vital role in

98
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,360
containing breaches so we'll take a look

99
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,120
at some of the important

100
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,600
factors that influence the effectiveness

101
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
of stock teams as well

102
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,840
so for this cost of a data breach report

103
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,039
the researchers

104
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,720
use an accounting method called

105
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,319
activity-based costing

106
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,280
which identifies activities and then

107
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,560
assigns a cost

108
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,680
according to the actual use so as you

109
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,400
can see here

110
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,360
there are multiple different activities

111
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,479
under each of these four

112
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,759
cost centers that was taken into account

113
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,400
for the

114
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,680
costings of the the data breach

115
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,680
okay so now that we have some background

116
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,000
let me first start by

117
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,319
sharing with you where the state of play

118
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,080
is today what's the current state of

119
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,880
play

120
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,440
and what i want to start with is sharing

121
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,680
with you the average

122
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,319
time it takes an organization to

123
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,280
identify

124
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,080
and contain a breach anyone want to have

125
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,759
a quick guess at what the average time

126
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,080
would be

127
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,479
yes

128
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,160
correct so it's 280 days to identify

129
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,599
that's a global average

130
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,240
and when we look at australia it's the

131
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,360
results even worse

132
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,919
right in australia threat actors are in

133
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:22,960
our environment

134
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,280
for 296 days before their identity

135
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,759
before the activities are identified and

136
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,479
contained

137
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,680
so that means 296 days threat actors are

138
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,560
creeping around you

139
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,319
our environment in australia australian

140
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,319
organizations moving laterally

141
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:40,319
trying to understand their victim and

142
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,919
understand how they can monetize the

143
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,400
activity as much as possible before

144
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,479
their activities are identified and

145
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,800
contained so we need to do a better job

146
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,680
at this right

147
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,759
because well obviously the longer threat

148
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,120
actors are in your environment the more

149
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,440
it's

150
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,560
damage they can cause and another reason

151
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,599
why we want to

152
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,080
reduce this time frame is because time

153
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,520
is money

154
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,080
in this study researchers were able to

155
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,440
work out the average

156
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,280
cost of a data breach based on the

157
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,199
breach life cycle

158
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,879
so you can see here the longer it takes

159
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,720
to identify and contain a breach

160
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,479
the more it will cost your organization

161
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,720
in 2020 for example you can see here

162
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,639
that the breaches with the life cycle

163
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,240
of more than 200 days so that's

164
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,400
basically the time taken to identify

165
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,599
and contain a breach right so that

166
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,520
on average costs us 1.12 million dollars

167
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,320
more

168
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,399
than if a breach was identified and

169
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,799
contained in less than 200 days

170
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,559
so this is another reason why you need

171
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,159
to implement tools

172
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,919
that will help you process and identify

173
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:44,959
and reduce

174
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,399
the breach lifecycle and

175
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,240
when we look at the when we look at the

176
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,480
average change

177
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,560
of the total cost of a data breach from

178
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,680
previous years

179
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,959
again it's not very good news for

180
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,040
australian organizations right because

181
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,800
the cost of the data breach has actually

182
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,720
gone up by nearly 10

183
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,880
not a trend that we want to be

184
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,920
maintaining

185
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,279
and if i can draw your attention to the

186
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,360
bottom you'll see that uh

187
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,839
organizations in south africa italy

188
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:12,399
france

189
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,760
and germany have all managed to reduce

190
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:16,959
this trend

191
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,720
they've actually been able to reduce the

192
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,560
cost of a data breach

193
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:24,560
from previous years so it is possible

194
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,360
and the big question is then what are

195
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,000
they doing that we are not

196
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,560
right and so the answer is that they are

197
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,279
doing

198
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,200
a better job of addressing some of the

199
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,560
big ticket items that i'll be sharing

200
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,040
with you just a little later

201
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,480
now the appointment institute actually

202
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,839
has also provided us with the root cause

203
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:45,760
of many of the breaches in fact all of

204
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,600
the 524

205
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,160
breaches that they investigated so we

206
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,200
can clearly see

207
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,760
what the big ticket items are that need

208
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,320
the most

209
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,360
urgent attention

210
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,800
these are where most organizations are

211
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,360
still

212
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,839
failing to implement effective security

213
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:05,200
controls

214
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,279
so the number one attack vector for that

215
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,240
now by the way

216
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,640
just want to be very very clear that

217
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,399
most of the organizations will have

218
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,519
security controls

219
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,920
to address these vectors but the problem

220
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,160
is that the tools that are using

221
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,680
are not very effective so the real

222
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,279
question i want you to be

223
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,399
asking yourself is how effective are my

224
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,760
security controls

225
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,920
and policies for these big ticket items

226
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,760
so the number one attack vector

227
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,920
that for data breaches according to the

228
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,440
appointment institute

229
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,720
is compromised credentials 19

230
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,320
of organizations that had a data breach

231
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,160
failed to prevent corporate credentials

232
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,279
from falling into the wrong hands

233
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,959
and another 19 of the breach that's

234
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,839
nearly one in every five breach

235
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,600
is due to cloud misconfiguration

236
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,680
almost every company now has a cloud

237
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,880
adoption strategy

238
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,959
our incident response team have also

239
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,959
seen a huge spike

240
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,200
in cloud-based attacks over the last

241
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,120
five years

242
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,880
sixteen percent of the breaches is due

243
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,720
to vulnerabilities in third-party

244
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,680
software

245
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,800
so you must have a robust vulnerability

246
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,000
management game plan having a

247
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
well-segmented network is also

248
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,120
essential in preventing a attacker from

249
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,240
moving laterally

250
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,240
once they've compromised your

251
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,079
infrastructure using vulnerabilities

252
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,800
next i've actually grouped phishing

253
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,760
attacks and

254
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,680
business email compromises together

255
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,880
because typically a business email

256
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,519
compromise starts with a phishing attack

257
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,959
so these two attack vectors were

258
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,800
responsible for another 19

259
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,880
of breaches these five attack vectors

260
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,680
are being heavily utilized by uh threat

261
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,200
actors and are responsible for nearly

262
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,040
three quarters of the breaches

263
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,480
so make sure you ruthlessly prioritize

264
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,920
security controls for these top five

265
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,000
attack vectors and re-evaluate the

266
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,360
security effectiveness

267
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,079
of your tools and your processes the

268
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:06,800
checkpoint

269
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,440
internet response team have also worked

270
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,000
a number of

271
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,519
cases where businesses have had these

272
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,240
controls

273
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,920
but were ineffective

274
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,560
so as part of your cyber security risk

275
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,360
assessment

276
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,800
i urge you to identify the effectiveness

277
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
of these security controls

278
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,240
i know it's a lot of work it's a lot of

279
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,800
heartache but make sure that you do this

280
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,519
because it will be worth it

281
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,959
make sure you understand where you are

282
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,160
vulnerable and deal with it

283
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,440
now please also make sure that you're

284
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,800
addressing all of these other tech

285
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,920
vectors as well

286
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,680
right so make sure these receive

287
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,440
priority in your cyber resilience

288
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,000
strategy

289
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,279
okay now that we've looked at these

290
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,760
vectors where do we start

291
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,279
i think it's really important to start

292
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,279
with the right mindset

293
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,480
and when it comes to cyber security it's

294
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,399
a prevention mindset

295
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,639
the more threats that your security

296
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:01,519
controls

297
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,720
will prevent the less your team has to

298
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,120
run around and remediate

299
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,279
now anyone know the difference between

300
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,560
between

301
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,120
prevention and detection you know what

302
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,760
it looks like

303
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,200
this is what it looks like our incident

304
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,959
response team

305
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,839
have worked many cases where post breach

306
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:22,399
analysis

307
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,920
has revealed that the threats

308
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,680
could have been prevented in many many

309
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,200
cases right

310
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,200
most of the so-called sophisticated

311
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,560
attacks that we hear about

312
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,560
that compromise environment environments

313
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,360
and organizations every day

314
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,240
are not that sophisticated now i want

315
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,880
you to

316
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,199
i want you to understand that the most

317
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,720
that most of these breaches

318
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,440
could have been prevented so you have to

319
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,279
change your mindset

320
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,040
now i'm not saying that you would be

321
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,560
able to remediate or

322
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,440
be able to prevent successfully 100 of

323
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,199
the attack no

324
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,760
but where you are using defense

325
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,880
detecting threats

326
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,839
you've got to then automate that so

327
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,000
you've got to automate your response

328
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,040
so if you have manual processes you must

329
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,720
automate them as much as possible

330
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,160
now let's look at the top five attack

331
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,440
vectors right so the number one attack

332
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,959
vector that appointment institute said

333
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:17,680
was being

334
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,519
was being leveraged was compromised

335
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,120
credentials

336
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,480
so make sure that your security controls

337
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,760
will prevent or alert your your sock

338
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,639
team

339
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,760
when a corporate user exposes their

340
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:32,959
corporate credential

341
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,120
on a site that doesn't belong to your

342
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,959
organization

343
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,320
these security controls exist

344
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,760
now to address credential

345
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,760
compromise it's essential that you focus

346
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,040
on

347
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,680
protecting not only laptops and tablets

348
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,199
but also mobile phones

349
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,720
because phishing links are being

350
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,320
delivered via whatsapp

351
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,680
as well as sms's so make sure that

352
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,680
you are addressing this right do you

353
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,519
have a way to

354
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,079
scan for example links that are received

355
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,680
in whatsapp message

356
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,720
do you have a way to scan links that are

357
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:13,040
received by your corporate users via sms

358
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,519
and make sure again that you're

359
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,480
addressing

360
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,279
all of these different tax surfaces so

361
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:20,160
if you

362
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,920
do these three things here this will

363
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,839
help you organization address the

364
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,519
three of the top five attack vectors

365
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,600
that are being currently exploited

366
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,199
so again make sure you have security

367
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,600
controls to to prevent access to

368
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,399
phishing sites

369
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,000
especially those that are trying to

370
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,480
impersonate your corporate domain

371
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,079
implement security controls to block

372
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,240
phishing emails look for browser-based

373
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,880
solutions as well because your end users

374
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,800
are also likely to be phished by

375
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,360
personal emails and again it's

376
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,720
absolutely critical

377
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,959
that you have security controls to

378
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,639
prevent corporate passwords being

379
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,000
exposed on non-corporate

380
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,199
site the other prominent attack vector

381
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,720
that we saw in the cost of the data

382
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,279
breach

383
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,880
was cloud-based configuration now in the

384
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,320
last five years of working cloud

385
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,839
incidents

386
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,240
we see that most organizations still

387
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,079
don't understand shared responsibility

388
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:11,040
model especially as they move from

389
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,639
infrastructure as a service to

390
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,800
software as a service to the containers

391
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,320
and the serverless stuff

392
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,000
right sure you've got faster ways of

393
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,839
doing things but security is still your

394
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:22,480
responsibility

395
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,480
we see organizations make the same

396
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,399
mistakes over

397
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,000
and over and over again and all of these

398
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,279
center around two things

399
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,199
vulnerabilities and misconfigurations

400
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,920
nine out of ten calls for help that we

401
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,399
receive

402
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,480
our response team receives around cloud

403
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,519
breaches

404
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,199
are something as stupid as bitcoin

405
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,120
miners

406
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,600
right so again attackers are doing the

407
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,720
same thing they've been doing for the

408
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,800
last 20 and 30 years of the internet

409
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,120
which is to look for vulnerable services

410
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,800
find a way to exploit them for their own

411
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,160
game

412
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:00,160
and if we if you have legacy systems

413
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,279
please understand

414
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:04,079
be aware that attackers will and can

415
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:05,520
exploit them

416
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,439
if you have active directory for example

417
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,799
and it's connected to your cloud

418
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,760
infrastructure

419
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,839
be very careful we're seeing a lot of

420
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,520
attacks a lot of organizations

421
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,959
that are being compromised this way

422
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,000
now we worked a recent case where an

423
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,760
organization called us and wanted to

424
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:22,400
understand

425
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,439
how they had complete data breach

426
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,240
and uh they had fairly tight security

427
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,039
controls

428
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,640
but within a very small amount of time

429
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,480
we were able to tell them

430
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,559
that one of their admin panel was

431
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,678
exposed to the internet

432
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,840
the attacker was able to access the

433
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,880
admin panel

434
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,280
get root on the server and started

435
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,480
mapping out

436
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,320
their um the cloud environment and how

437
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,679
they could move laterally

438
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,919
in the organization and what they found

439
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,679
is that the victim actually had a vpn

440
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,679
connection back to the corporate network

441
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,840
which led to a database server and well

442
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,840
it didn't really end well for this

443
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,000
organization

444
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,160
a new trade that we're seeing also is

445
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,000
more and more attackers are now

446
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,320
looking to try and go after your api

447
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,360
keys and

448
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,039
and i'll be honest with you we don't see

449
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,320
a lot of uh good hygiene around this

450
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,880
so make sure you focus on this as well

451
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,880
now we've started our managed service

452
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,440
i manage detection and response service

453
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,480
here at checkpoint

454
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,840
and one of the first things that we did

455
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,720
was actually turn on our cloud posture

456
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,080
management solution

457
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,640
and it became very clear to us that most

458
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,840
organizations

459
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:33,039
just don't appreciate how dynamic cloud

460
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,480
environments are the rate at which

461
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,840
things are being torn up

462
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:40,000
spun up and shrunk is just incredible

463
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,559
and so the key to cloud security is

464
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,760
visibility and control

465
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,080
make sure you have a way to visualize

466
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,640
all your cloud assets

467
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,480
and a way to automatically remediate

468
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,480
misconfigurations

469
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,280
if you have a cloud adoption strategy

470
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,600
then cloud posture management solution

471
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,559
right must be a non-negotiable tool in

472
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,520
your cyber strategy

473
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,440
now vulnerability in third party

474
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,440
software is the other big ticket

475
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,200
it's not just the zero day stuff that

476
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,120
you need to be worried about right

477
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,799
as you can see here threat actors are

478
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,039
still exploiting vulnerabilities from 10

479
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,000
years ago

480
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,720
and they're being successful at it these

481
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,960
vulnerabilities are just software bugs

482
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,400
that threat actors weaponize

483
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,280
so virtual patching must be part of your

484
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,960
vulnerability and patch management

485
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,600
strategy

486
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,679
now we get it it takes a lot of time to

487
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:34,640
patch systems but

488
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,679
cyber criminals don't care so you have

489
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:38,320
to

490
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,280
focus on preventing attacks before they

491
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,280
reach vulnerable systems

492
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,440
now make sure your intrusion prevention

493
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,559
systems

494
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,160
are configured in line with vendor best

495
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,919
practice make sure that you are

496
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,600
automating the download of ips

497
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,960
signatures

498
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,640
don't be the low hanging fruit for

499
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,880
attackers use virtual patching to

500
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,360
prevent

501
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,120
as much of the attacks as possible

502
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,320
okay now let's look at key factors

503
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,520
that impact the cost of a data breach

504
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,840
i cannot stress how important it is for

505
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,640
you to

506
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,360
make sure that all of these factors are

507
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,720
taken into account for your cyber

508
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,640
resilience strategy

509
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,400
so what you're seeing here in the green

510
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,640
are the various factors that will reduce

511
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,320
the cost of the data breach

512
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,480
and the cost associated with each of

513
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,360
them

514
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,280
so according to appointment institute

515
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,480
the 2020

516
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,120
cost of a data breach report testing and

517
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,039
fine-tuning your incident response plan

518
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,679
has the most largest impact in reducing

519
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,880
the cost of your data breach

520
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,799
implementing an effective business

521
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,640
continuity has a second

522
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,120
largest impact in reducing the cost of

523
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,280
your data breach

524
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,600
just having an incident response team

525
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,400
will help

526
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,520
in reducing the cost of a data breach

527
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,760
and running up the top four is ai-based

528
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,960
platforms

529
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,440
what we're really referring to here are

530
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,200
platforms that can automate

531
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,919
and orchestrate cyber security response

532
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,240
to

533
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,679
take the burden of your sock team

534
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,720
so if you are not doing this already

535
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,280
i recommend that you invest your time

536
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,080
and understand

537
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,640
the benefit of automating your incident

538
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,480
response and

539
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,760
and the benefit that it could deliver to

540
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,919
your organization

541
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,919
investing in red team testing security

542
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:26,960
awareness training

543
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,840
security analytics encryption tools and

544
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,760
threat intelligence sharing also all

545
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,440
yield very large

546
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,280
positive return in reducing the cost of

547
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,280
a data breach

548
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,600
now let's look at some factors that

549
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,840
actually increase the cost of a data

550
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,400
breach

551
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,600
so the worst thing that you could do

552
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,520
with your server strategy

553
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,720
is to keep throwing point products at it

554
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,400
because you can see that this leads to

555
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,360
security complexity

556
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,760
getting your cloud cyber strategy wrong

557
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,600
adds a lot more to the

558
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,440
cost of a data breach and again this is

559
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,799
why it's so important

560
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,960
to have that visibility and the

561
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,600
automatic remediation capability

562
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,679
right so that you can address security

563
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,120
oversight

564
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,919
skill shortage is another factor that is

565
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,799
costing organizations a lot of money

566
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,480
so it's important that you have a

567
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,360
strategy to address skill shortage

568
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,360
all of these factors are important and

569
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,480
your cyber strategy

570
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,120
must take all of these into account

571
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:28,559
let's now take a deeper dive at some of

572
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,440
the big ticket items here

573
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,240
now as you saw earlier the most

574
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,240
important factor in reducing the cost of

575
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,520
a data breach

576
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,799
is testing your incident response plan

577
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,640
many of the organizations that called

578
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,880
our incident response team for help

579
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,679
had incident response plan but when it

580
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,200
was put to test

581
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,120
they failed miserably so make sure your

582
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,000
incident response

583
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,480
plan your playbooks are validated by

584
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,600
external

585
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,320
incident response teams who do this for

586
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,080
a living

587
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,919
they've seen more incident response

588
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:06,559
failures than you can imagine

589
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,640
so they can help you fine-tune your

590
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,440
incident response

591
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,320
you have to do tabletop exercise and

592
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,840
especially under these new

593
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,400
new conditions one of the key learnings

594
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,159
from our incident response team

595
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,600
is that most organizations don't have a

596
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,919
platform to enable efficient

597
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,760
cross-company communication

598
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,360
and collaboration between every

599
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,159
stakeholder during a crisis

600
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,960
the legal team your pr team your hr your

601
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,640
sock team your executives

602
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,799
don't actually have platforms that they

603
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,799
can use to communicate during this

604
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,480
crisis

605
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,960
if you are if your email system and your

606
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,200
active directory is hit with ransomware

607
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,799
then how is your instant response team

608
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,880
going to communicate

609
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,559
we've actually seen organizations having

610
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,480
to revert to whatsapp chat groups

611
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,120
because they had no other choice so ask

612
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,240
yourself

613
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,960
do we have a platform for crisis

614
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,200
management

615
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,520
that will allow all of our stakeholders

616
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,120
to be able to effectively communicate

617
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,720
and consult with each other

618
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,320
and if you don't have this then it's

619
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,080
time to invest in one

620
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,080
the next big ticket item after instant

621
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,320
response was business continuity that

622
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,440
so as the saying goes failing to prepare

623
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,120
is preparing to fail

624
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,360
now i think covert 19 has highlighted

625
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,960
just how underprepared so many

626
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,159
organizations were with their business

627
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,760
continuity plan

628
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,960
not testing business continuity plan has

629
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,440
resulted in a just do it mindset for

630
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,720
many organizations

631
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,760
as they try to be more agile and and

632
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,159
allow projects such as remote working

633
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,720
and cloud projects to to basically

634
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,960
finish as quickly as possible so

635
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,799
unfortunately what we've seen

636
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,679
is that this rush this just do it

637
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:50,640
mindset

638
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,600
has led to many projects being rushed

639
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,240
through

640
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,240
without proper governance and assurance

641
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,279
process

642
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,200
and this has led to a lot of security

643
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,559
oversight which

644
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,240
are being actively exploited by

645
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,320
attackers so make sure that you address

646
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,440
this

647
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,440
now test your business continuity plan

648
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,679
make sure that security is embedded in

649
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,039
your plan

650
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,080
be sure to identify

651
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,919
and plan for all types of threats

652
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,120
against your organization

653
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,440
have a strategy to effectively

654
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,320
communicate

655
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,799
your plan to all stakeholders the last

656
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,080
thing you want is your employees to

657
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,679
start speculating on what they should do

658
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:26,320
next

659
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,440
or what's going on have a game plan on

660
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,559
what systems

661
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:35,039
and resources must be restored first

662
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,120
now in my mind the most important team

663
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,880
when it comes to reducing the cost of a

664
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,799
data breach

665
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,279
for any organization is your sock team

666
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,039
they are the glue that often hold your

667
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,880
incident response together

668
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,440
but when we speak to these teams they're

669
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,279
absolutely flat out

670
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:53,440
they're drowning in the number of alerts

671
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,159
and mundane tasks

672
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,880
and the recent tale of two socks report

673
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,159
from the polymer institute

674
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,640
again highlighted just how bad the

675
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,679
situation is

676
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,360
for stock teams 78 of sock teams

677
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,480
uh stock analysts working in stock teams

678
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,440
say that it's very painful three out of

679
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,080
four

680
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,640
sock analysts are experiencing burnout

681
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,520
as a result of

682
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,320
increased workload the last line of

683
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,840
defense is calling out for help

684
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,919
information over overload is a huge

685
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:26,960
problem which

686
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,200
will continue to be more of a problem as

687
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,480
businesses deploy new

688
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,320
tools for security now this report also

689
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,919
confirmed what we learned in the course

690
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,520
of data breach report which is that

691
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,840
complexity is a major issue for stock

692
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,600
teams to deal with

693
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,279
every single one of these trend is going

694
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,720
in the wrong direction

695
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,120
so if you want to reduce the cost of a

696
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,320
data breach

697
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,679
then you need to make sure you're

698
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:53,840
addressing all of these challenges here

699
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,279
and so it's not surprising it's

700
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,640
not much of a surprise to us when we

701
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,640
speak to sock managers

702
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,559
and sock teams that they feel all alone

703
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,799
in their fight in their mission to try

704
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,279
and save their team from uh

705
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,640
from defeat in fact they feel very much

706
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,240
like this next guy

707
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,640
yes he does here he goes winding up for

708
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,120
the shot

709
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,640
the and has fired and hit sterling

710
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,159
directly to the face

711
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,200
here he goes with the approach oh

712
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,760
sterling with a fantastic time yes as

713
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,600
his trainer takes him off the field

714
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,240
like a mustache lion dragging a gazelle

715
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,600
through the serengeti

716
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,039
still waiting for the kick to happen

717
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,840
he's probably wondering when oh

718
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,039
sweet buttered crumpet the ball drills

719
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:43,840
sterling

720
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,840
right in the face he literally just has

721
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,880
to kick it anywhere

722
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,880
except we're selling a city there is no

723
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,960
possible way that north carolina can

724
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,960
mess up this shop

725
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,200
158 kilometers per hour this man can do

726
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,640
no wrong look at him

727
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,039
for mercy i think they have a lot in

728
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,120
common with sock tips

729
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,960
now all jokes aside the tale of two

730
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,039
stocks report has provided us with some

731
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,279
great insights into what makes sock

732
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,039
teams ineffective

733
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,360
and as you can see the survey validates

734
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,440
again what we've said before

735
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,440
lack of visibility is a huge problem for

736
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,960
stock teams

737
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,200
this report confirmed that to us that

738
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,039
the sock teams are ineffective due to

739
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:23,919
lack of

740
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,919
timely remediation and one of the

741
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,600
reasons for this is because

742
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,919
they spend so much time doing mundane

743
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:30,640
tasks

744
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,600
that chew up valuable time and they are

745
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,600
having to do this stuff

746
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,000
over and over and over again these are

747
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,520
very repetitive tasks

748
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,039
now speak to any stock manager and they

749
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,399
will tell you that it's next to

750
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,360
impossible

751
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,240
to find good staff in soft teams right

752
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:46,880
they're heavily

753
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,720
under under under resourced

754
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,080
and in addition sock teams often have a

755
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:54,559
lot of

756
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,320
tribal knowledge right these are

757
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,840
knowledge that basically are not written

758
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,320
down

759
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,919
but carried in the heads of the senior

760
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,679
analysts and so as these

761
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,760
analysts leave your organization that

762
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,840
knowledge that way of doing things

763
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,840
lives with them now another reason why

764
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,120
soft teams

765
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,919
struggle is because they have too many

766
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,760
tools

767
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,000
if you look at a sales organization

768
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,520
typically they'll have one dashboard

769
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,240
which is either salesforce or workday

770
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,520
and they can get all the information

771
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,840
they need to carry out their work

772
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,200
but for a sock team they have to

773
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,120
manually check multiple tools

774
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,720
validate against various different

775
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,679
systems all of these things take time it

776
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:32,880
increases the time

777
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,200
it takes to identify and contain

778
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,399
breaches

779
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,320
so the problem with having a lot of

780
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,559
these security tools

781
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,880
is that there is no connectivity fabric

782
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,240
between them

783
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,720
these tools don't talk to each other in

784
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,440
a way

785
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,000
a cohesive suite of products should

786
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,039
so if you want a high performance soft

787
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:55,679
team

788
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,080
you must find a way to address all of

789
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,480
these challenges

790
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,720
and so the best way to address these

791
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,960
challenges in my view is to utilize

792
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,360
security orchestration automation

793
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,320
response

794
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,159
uh response platforms right so a good

795
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:11,679
sole platform

796
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,159
can help you reduce the workload of your

797
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,360
soft teeth

798
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,840
by automating and orchestrating incident

799
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,919
response tasks

800
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,480
so that they can make important

801
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,159
decisions quickly

802
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:28,880
with much greater context and accuracy

803
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,000
it can provide a crisis management

804
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,279
platform for all of your incident

805
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,480
response stakeholders

806
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,360
to communicate during a crisis so

807
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,919
platforms can maximize

808
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,799
your return on investment with your

809
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,880
existing security tools

810
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,840
because it can provide that connectivity

811
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,799
fabric and importantly

812
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,360
it can help triage threats so that your

813
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,399
sock teams

814
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,640
are prioritizing the most dangerous

815
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,240
threats first

816
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,120
this is an incredibly important point

817
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,799
because human nature is that

818
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,000
we tend to work in a sequential order

819
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,080
what you want your sock team to do is

820
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,240
start to prioritize and focus

821
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,320
on the most dangerous threats first the

822
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,519
ones that's going to hurt your

823
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,480
organization

824
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:19,840
the most

825
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,519
and uh so as you're investigating your

826
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,279
soul platforms

827
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:30,399
make sure that the platform can

828
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,720
take all the alerts from different

829
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,279
different systems from different vendors

830
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,240
right and automate them in a way that it

831
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,640
puts

832
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,440
all the same threats in the same bucket

833
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:41,919
so

834
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,039
if basically if a threat

835
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,679
um if you've got multiple alerts those

836
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,200
alerts belonging to the same threat

837
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,440
should belong in the same case

838
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,120
so that the same analyst is working

839
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:54,799
those cases

840
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:58,159
so the platform must provide a threat

841
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:01,440
centric view rather than a alert centric

842
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,000
view

843
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,880
this is a really important point if you

844
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,399
are serious about

845
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,120
reducing the time it takes to identify

846
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,000
and contain a breach

847
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,399
and so my final thought on selecting a

848
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:15,679
saw platform

849
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,760
is uh that the platform must be very

850
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,679
diagnostic

851
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,200
this is why we've partnered with

852
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,720
simplify

853
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,640
now apart from us as you can see here

854
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,039
they've actually got over 200

855
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:29,120
integration partners and some of the

856
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,080
ones that

857
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,679
you may be familiar with are here on the

858
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:33,279
screen

859
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,440
which includes seam vendors includes

860
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,320
cloud players

861
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,919
includes network endpoint security

862
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,519
vendors and various other key

863
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,559
security solution providers so please

864
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,440
take the time and understand how a soar

865
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,080
platform

866
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,399
can help you reduce the cost of a data

867
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,399
breach

868
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,720
now before i wrap up one last thing i

869
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,600
want to touch on

870
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,640
is security complexity the reality is

871
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,360
that most of us

872
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,279
will have many different security tools

873
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,640
from different vendors

874
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,600
now as i as i showed you earlier

875
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,200
security complexity

876
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,000
was the largest factor in increasing the

877
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,320
cost of a data breach

878
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,559
so have a strategy on reducing the

879
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,880
number of point products you have

880
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,120
at checkpoint we have been helping

881
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,120
organizations secure their network

882
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,919
their endpoints their cloud mobile as

883
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,240
well as iot

884
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,120
we help secure users and their access no

885
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,399
matter where they are

886
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,640
and our instant response team can help

887
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,559
you with security assessment

888
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,399
we can help you fine-tune your instant

889
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:35,600
response label

890
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,399
we can actually help you also build out

891
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,360
your stock capability

892
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,919
so to wrap up very important that you

893
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,279
focus on preventing

894
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,440
attacks before they do the damage don't

895
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,120
be the low-hanging fruit

896
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,559
for the cyber criminals the big ticket

897
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,720
items to focus on to prevent attacks was

898
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,159
compromised credentials so have security

899
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,519
controls for that

900
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,919
cloud misconfiguration third-party

901
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,159
software vulnerabilities

902
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:04,080
phishing attacks and business email

903
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,519
compromise

904
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,239
please re-evaluate the security

905
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,320
effectiveness of the tools that you have

906
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,800
this is what is causing a lot of the

907
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,240
heartache for many organizations

908
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,679
and make sure that you've configured

909
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,960
your security in line with vendor best

910
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,719
practice

911
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,679
i shared with you 25 key factors that

912
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,879
influence the cost

913
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:27,760
of a data breach make sure that you

914
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,359
ruthlessly prioritize on these

915
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:33,918
test your incident response plan and

916
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:36,159
your business continuity plan

917
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,359
be sure to carry out tabletop exercise

918
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,359
especially under the news new normal

919
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:42,639
conditions

920
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,480
uh invest some time and understand how a

921
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,399
solar platform can help you reduce

922
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,000
the time it takes to identify and

923
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,639
contain a breach

924
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:53,440
and invest in a crisis management

925
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,239
platform

926
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,918
that can be used by all of your

927
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,839
stakeholders when

928
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:01,200
the unfortunate happens

929
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,200
look for solutions that can help you

930
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,280
build repeatable

931
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,440
automated security processes very

932
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,720
important

933
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,880
and finally start the process of

934
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,079
consolidating

935
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:17,839
and simplifying your cyber security

936
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:19,760
so thanks so much for your time we're

937
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,839
located at g11 come and say hello to us

938
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:22,160
we'd

939
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,000
love to have a conversation around how

940
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,280
we can help you

941
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,240
automate your incident response now i

942
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,520
think we can move to question and

943
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,040
answers

944
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,920
great thanks for that um tim actually

945
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,520
asks here and he's got quite a few

946
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,320
upvotes

947
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,640
can credential exposure be detected from

948
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,240
personal computers not on the corporate

949
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,119
network

950
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,599
and if so how okay that's a great

951
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,240
question

952
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,280
so the solution that we have is

953
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,760
uh corporate credentials being uh being

954
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,560
uh

955
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,640
identified and and stopped if it's on

956
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,000
corporate devices right because

957
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,760
it's there's an ad integration that

958
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,359
needs to happen there

959
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,560
yep so great tim also asked what

960
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,880
the sorry with the breaches that have

961
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,640
been investigated by checkpoint

962
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,880
do you have any comments on the role of

963
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,280
cyber insurance in reducing the cost

964
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,520
whether it's effective or not insurance

965
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,040
and the compliance requirements

966
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,880
that's a great question okay so here's

967
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,480
my view on cyber insurance right

968
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,079
you've got to stop using that as a get

969
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,599
out of jail card because

970
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,960
uh because we are now getting reports

971
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,200
that some cyber insurance companies are

972
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,720
going to stop providing

973
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,040
cyber insurance now and for example you

974
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,560
take the recent breach in the states

975
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:30,880
with

976
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,560
the pipelines but that breach will cost

977
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,640
in the billions for cyber insurance

978
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,320
companies to pay out

979
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,119
so so i think the trend will be that

980
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,800
you'll see less and less cyber insurance

981
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,079
companies offering cyber insurance

982
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:44,880
that's the first thing

983
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,040
the second thing on cyber insurance is

984
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,680
that we know threat actors are actively

985
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,400
targeting

986
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,320
cyber insurance companies because they

987
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,520
want to know

988
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,240
which companies are paying for cyber

989
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,760
insurance because they will get paid it

990
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:58,880
makes it easier

991
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,880
for them right if they know what those

992
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:02,800
targets are they'll go after those

993
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,240
organizations first

994
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,839
does that make sense yeah easier on the

995
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,440
ransomware if you know you can get paid

996
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,359
absolutely yeah one thing i also noted

997
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:10,720
in some insurance policies i've seen

998
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,839
recently is

999
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:14,240
there's an exclusion if you haven't

1000
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,359
detected it

1001
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,000
yourself so if somebody else detects and

1002
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,960
reports it

1003
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,200
they don't pay out so you actually need

1004
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,640
to stay on top of your stuff for those

1005
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,320
insurance policies

1006
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,920
that's a different one uh another

1007
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,599
question here is was

1008
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:30,560
from lee was malware involved in data

1009
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,839
breach research

1010
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,240
uh in the data breach research you had

1011
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,160
if so what percentage of attacks

1012
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,119
involve malware rather than maybe sort

1013
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,079
of more targeted

1014
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,480
attacks right so so i think these are

1015
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,839
the tech vectors that we were talking

1016
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:44,880
about here right so

1017
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,320
malware would definitely play a part in

1018
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,240
that so for example if you think about

1019
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,200
phishing attacks

1020
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,240
if you think about business email

1021
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,920
compromise especially phishing attacks

1022
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:52,880
100

1023
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,160
right phishing attacks will typically

1024
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,680
lead to a document or some sort of a

1025
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,720
file that you want

1026
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,560
uh your end users to double click on or

1027
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,560
maybe even just get to a site

1028
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,800
that has drive by downloads so you want

1029
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,480
to be able to so that actors will try

1030
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,000
and get you to those those sites

1031

1033
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,920

um with respect to burnout are there any

1039
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,960
metrics you gathered in

1040
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,560
what you know how much does a sock

1041
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,320
analyst how much can they actually take

1042
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,480
is there any metric where you know that

1043
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,839
if

1044
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,800
you know a sock is being hit by x amount

1045
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,560
you know six months later you see a lot

1046
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,079
of people leaving or going on stress

1047
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:35,040
leave or anything like

1048
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,400
are there any metrics around this

1049
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,480
because you you hear a lot about burnout

1050
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:38,800
and

1051
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,800
analysts just quitting or changing

1052
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,320
industry

1053
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,960
how do we detect that and then prevent

1054
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:45,520
it

1055
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,760
great question so i think the the tale

1056
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,880

1057
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,480
uh addresses that i don't have the

1058
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,320
numbers of off the top of my head but

1059
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,599
the tail of two stocks report does

1060
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:54,800
address that

1061
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:57,839

1063
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,800
