testifying in front of congress take us

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,200
back to where the idea for have i been

17
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,600
pwned first percolated was there a

18
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,360
eureka moment in this view

19
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,879
just a bit overwhelmed about seeing

20
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,800
people again yes

21
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,120
that's the first thing i mean my eureka

22
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,239
moment forever being pained

23
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,559
was probably the adobe data breach so in

24
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,079
2013 adobe got hacked 150 million ish

25
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,879
accounts and and i was in there twice

26
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:53,680
which

27
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,520
surprised me because i didn't think i

28
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,680
gave my data to adobe

29
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,719
and then i didn't think i gave it to

30
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,879
them twice but i was a macromedia user

31
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,640
and i had used dreamweaver from

32
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,080
macromedia and then adobe bought it and

33
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,119
my data went in there and i was like

34
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,479
well if i don't know my stuff's in there

35
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,119
what about

36
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,960
other people they mustn't know either

37
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,400
yeah oh this would be a bit of fun i'll

38
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,680
stand up and some of my mates will use

39
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:11,920
it

40
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,240
and you know see how it goes and and now

41
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,759
here we are with like

42
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,240
ncsc founder talking about it put some

43
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,320
numbers on it how big is have i been

44
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:20,880
pwned

45
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,799
now there's 11 i think 11.6 billion-ish

46
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,880
records in there at the moment 11.6

47
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,159
billion records

48
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,360
yeah yeah yeah it's a lot of a lot of

49
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,880
clouds

50
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,439
was there a turning point where it went

51
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,040
from being

52
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,200
a fun did it instantly go massive or did

53
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,560
it bubble along for a while and then

54
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,000
there was one big thing that

55
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,119
pushed it to the next level do these

56
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,040
things grow in a straight line or they

57
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,960
plateau then jump it's all kind of

58
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,159
relative it

59
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,320
it i mean it was december 2013 it

60
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,680
started very small but it

61
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,159
it got a lot of unexpected exposure

62
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,600
really quickly which i found

63
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,640
quite strange because there are a few

64
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,399
other services that did similar things

65
00:01:58,399 --> 00:01:59,680
and then over time

66
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,200
it's just gradually gotten bigger and

67
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,799
bigger and bigger to the point where

68
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,799
today there's about 300 000 people a day

69
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,399
that come to the service

70
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,080
but of course then there are there's

71
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,919
there are peaks right so the facebook

72
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,920
phone number thing a few weeks ago there

73
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,440
was about six million people in a day

74
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,319
that came to that

75
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,760
a couple of years ago when we had the

76
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,720
collection one stuff with

77
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,239
732 million i think uh unique email

78
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,520
addresses i've got about 10 million

79
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,400
people a day

80
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,400
to the service so there's always peaks

81
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,840
but it just keeps gradually getting

82
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,959
bigger and bigger

83
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,000
are there people are there nasty agents

84
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,120
out there who think it would just be

85
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,040
funny to bring down that site by

86
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,480
definition does it give much

87
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,560
and look it it probably does but to be

88
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,680
honest a lot of it

89
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,680
a lot of it just goes unnoticed partly

90
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,040
it's just behind cloudflare and i keep a

91
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,239
lot of nasty stuff out

92
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:45,680
but partly also it's like it's it's

93
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,200
super super simple i mean what you see

94
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,640
on the front page is basically what it

95
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,120
is it's a page and like an api behind it

96
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,480
and a few other things to try and stop

97
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,319
abusing the api and

98
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,319
and that's about it but it's a bit like

99
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,760
anything that you stand up on the

100
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,319
internet

101
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,840
will immediately start getting hammered

102
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,680
by bots trying to find

103
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,480
vulnerabilities and admin.php pages

104
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,599
somewhere other

105
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,159
what about more traditional uh you know

106
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,599
the old way of bringing things down is

107
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,000
through

108
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
legal recourse is it a universally

109
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,800
popular side or is it ever had

110
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,440
legal threats against what what what

111
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,040
would be criticisms or what would the

112
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,720
enemies of the site

113
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,040
want to do to it it's been pretty good

114
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,400
lately i think because people have been

115
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,360
preoccupied

116
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,879
and i like the last year and ever so

117
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,560
we've got bigger things to deal with

118
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,200
but i mean never anything serious most

119
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,480
of the time it's like

120
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,000
i didn't give you permission to have my

121
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,599
data and it's like oh yeah you didn't

122
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,720
give the hacker's permission either but

123
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,920
like here we are and it's all over the

124
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,040
place so what are we now going to do

125
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,000
about it

126
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
uh so look i've just added all the bits

127
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,840
i can in terms of it there's opt out and

128
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,680
there's multiple ways of opting out and

129
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,440
what gets really funny is people like i

130
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,680
would like to opt out so yeah no worries

131
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,120
and i would like you not to load any

132
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,400
more of my data in there but i don't

133
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,840
want you to have my data and then i'm

134
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,640
like

135
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,080
how am i going to know not to put you in

136
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,760
there again if i can't have you and the

137
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,959
fact that you don't want to be in there

138
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,120
later on so you get these weird kind of

139
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,920
little

140
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,159
little cycles but no look there's never

141
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,360
been anything serious

142
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,920
uh in in terms of legal stuff i had one

143
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,959
one company

144
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,879
it's a company called uh adult fan

145
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,959
fiction so if you can imagine like if

146
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,640
you really like to read

147
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,440
about like vampire and ewok porn like

148
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,238
together

149
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,959
you would go sorry just go back vampire

150
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:21,279
and

151
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,120
ewok porn oh together

152
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,280
it's a real thing okay after you go home

153
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,040
google adult fan fiction

154
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,120
so it's a real thing so they got

155
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,720
breached and uh and they weren't real

156
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,520
happy that

157
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,120
that i told people they got preached

158
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,400
stuff they wouldn't reply to my emails

159
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,080
so we're gonna like send the lawyers no

160
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,080
one ever sends the lawyers after him

161
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,880
that was about four years ago no lawyers

162
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,840
yet so it's all right

163
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,960
let's have a look at the photo here

164
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,320
here's you testifying in front of the

165
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,120
u.s

166
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,040
congress where did this where did the

167
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,560
overture come from

168
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,560
to be there at the uh this looks you and

169

it is you've got

172
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,320
like they're the three typical sort of

173
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,560
people who end up testifying before us

174
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,520
congress

175
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,000
dude in the middle looks like he's mafia

176
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,360
boss who's about to roll over and

177
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,400
incriminate people

178
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,680
dude on the right looks like the

179
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,520
old-time american

180
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,160
lawyer or congressman and you look like

181
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:14,800
the young

182
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,440
up-and-coming republican superstar who's

183
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,639
about to have some

184
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,960
hideous sex scandal just explode all

185
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,560
over him and completely

186
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,479
anyway that's just me how did how did

187
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,479
this how did this come about what was it

188
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,120
all about

189
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,800
incidentally check out my socks so i had

190
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,160
the coolest socks because i had these

191
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,600
socks i got from sophos and

192
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,280
then they say for those about to code we

193
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,320
salute you and it's just like this

194
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,120
bearded dude

195
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,080
on the socks i thought it was fun um

196
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,280
like it was kind of interesting because

197
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,880
i had to chat some people in congress

198
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,520
before

199
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,360
where they had just general questions

200
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,960
about data breaches

201
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,479
and we had a little bit of to and fro

202
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,000
and very often like someone reaches out

203
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,039
and they want to talk and particularly

204
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,400
if they're government or law enforcement

205
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,600
i always find that particularly

206
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,400
interesting

207
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,759
so be like yeah yeah we'll have a chat

208
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,280
and i'll i'll go and sit in my backyard

209
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,479
and have a little talk

210
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,240
and then at some stage someone's like oh

211
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,680
can you come and testify in congress i'm

212
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,479
like

213
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,000
you know i'm australian right like you

214
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,440
really want me to do that yeah yeah

215
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,360
it'll be fun you should just do it

216
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,360
and and uh and i did it it was yeah it

217
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,199
was just super super interesting

218
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,840
and yeah it's just kind of like one of

219
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,280
those momentous occasions

220
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,440
what was congress investigating at the

221
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,520
time what was on the agenda that you got

222
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,400
an invite to the dance so it was the the

223
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,680
impact of data breach and knowledge

224
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,880
based authentication

225
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,880
so their their position was you know how

226
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,479
when you you call up your bank

227
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,919
and you're like hey you know i need to

228
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,120
make an inquiry or something they're

229
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,319
like yeah we just need to make sure you

230
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,520
are who you say you are

231
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,720
what's your date of birth and you're

232
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,560
just going to ah crap you know like the

233
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,080
thing that immutable piece of

234
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,360
information that's just

235
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,840
all over the place so they were

236
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,720
interested in

237
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,440
in how to how do all these data leaks

238
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,560
impact our ability

239
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,960
to authenticate people so there's just

240
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,319
lots of questions around you know what's

241
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,599
causing these breaches what are we doing

242
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,080
about it is it going to get any better

243
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,240
and yeah i don't know that we we sort of

244
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,360
solved everything

245
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,800
while i was there but hopefully we gave

246
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,240
them some food for thought what were

247
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,680
some of the points you raised that that

248
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,720
you think

249
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,560
landed with them or they really needed

250
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,880
to hear what do you think you you got on

251
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,800
the agenda or on their minds

252
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,199
so i crowdsourced most of my answers

253
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,479
like i wrote a blog post and hey i'm

254
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,160
going to congress what should i say

255
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,960
and someone gave me a really really epic

256
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,400
quote that i've used over and over again

257
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,919
and they said what you should tell them

258
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,800
is that organizations look at personal

259
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,400
data as an asset and they never look at

260
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,840
it as a liability

261
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,319
so they accumulate as much as they can

262
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,000
because they feel that they can monetize

263
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,599
that or turn into something better later

264
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:30,000
on

265
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,360
and they never look at it and go well

266
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,680
this could actually increase risk

267
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,199
so that that to me was that the one

268
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,800
thing that always sticks in my mind

269
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,599
with it we saw the um those little

270
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:40,720
mash-ups and

271
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,240
edits of zuckerberg etc testifying

272
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,680
before congress

273
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,120
and and they were going you know how do

274
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,400
you how do you possibly make money out

275
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,720
of a free website or we run ads

276
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,599
yeah and so some of the congress men and

277
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,039
women looked

278
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,120
pretty silly in some of those edits and

279
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,960
like they really

280
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,039
had not even got their head around color

281
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,879
tv let alone

282
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,160
the internet is that

283
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,759
but then again i'm mindful that's like a

284
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,280
one minute edit that's being done

285
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,639
possibly with the agenda trying to make

286
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,639
some of these people look pretty silly

287
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,400
in your experience were they across

288
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,639
their turf were some of them remarkably

289
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,000
ignorant some were incredibly well

290
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,120
informed what was the

291
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,000
actual quality of the interrogation you

292
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:22,720
received

293
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,240
i think first of all there are one

294
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,080
minute edits of all of us that frankly

295
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,360
make us look pretty silly

296
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,160
you will you'll find it the my life is

297
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,519
just a series of one-minute editions

298
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,760
the thing i think is really interesting

299
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,599
when you particularly when you watch tv

300
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:38,958
and you see even politicians here in

301
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:39,760
australia

302
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:42,719
that these folks have got to go from a

303
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,560
hearing like this for its its data

304
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,480
breaches and cyber and things like that

305
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,680
and then they've got to leave that and

306
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,800
then they've got to go and they've got

307
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,160
to do hearing around

308
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,279
in this case the next thing they're

309
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,640
doing was like a hearing on the opioid

310
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,519
epidemic

311
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,680
and i i know absolutely nothing about

312
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,959
that topic

313
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,959
so these folks have got to be high level

314
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,399
enough that they can go across all of

315
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,760
these different things

316
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,200
and then what's really interesting is

317
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,959
that they have staffers behind them who

318
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,279
then go deep on each one of these topics

319
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:08,800
so i spent a lot of time staffers doing

320
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,560
the cyber stuff and they were

321
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,959
really really smart switched on people

322
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,160
you'll never see them because they'll

323
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,839
never be in front of the camera

324
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,600
but they're the ones who advise the

325
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,959
congressmen and the congresswomen who

326
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:19,680
are

327
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,920
inevitably grilling the three of us here

328
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,600
so i i guess i have a lot of

329
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,839
sympathy for how far they need to spread

330
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,600
themselves across things and the trick

331
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,480
then for

332
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,839
for me was like all right well how do i

333
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,760
talk to these people in a way that

334
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,320
they're going to understand me so it's

335
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,680
high level enough but then there's

336
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,000
enough

337
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,360
detail that they can take that to the

338
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,720
staffers and they can hopefully do

339
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,920
something useful with it

340
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,440
there's a great question here are they

341
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,080
rm williams boots in the photo if so

342
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,600
it's a nice aussie shout out yep

343
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,839
yep absolutely so a fun story i had to

344
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,440
buy every single piece of clothing you

345
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,800
see in there because normally like i

346
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,160
lived here on the gold coast i

347
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,040
got dressed up to come here uh so i had

348
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,279
to

349
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,480
except for the socks which we've got for

350
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
free of course but yeah i bought uh

351
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,320
i bought a new pair of rms and so yeah

352
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,519
let's take a little bit of australia

353
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,120
congress on that point taking straight

354
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,959
of congress so without you know

355
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:06,480
pissing in the pocket as they say people

356
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,680
here but you've experienced this on the

357
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,120
world stage so

358
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,800
i always industry by industry i'm always

359
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,240
fascinated with what's australia's

360
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,240
reputation internationally

361
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,040
and what's seen as our real strong suits

362
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,079
or weak spots so as an aussie testifying

363
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,279
on this

364
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,880
what are the thoughts about australia in

365
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,279
the cyber security area and are there

366
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,160
any particular

367
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,079
areas of strength we're seen to have

368
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,760
well i mean i think australia has looked

369
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,760
as looked at as a pretty innovative

370
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,200
uh country and and we've got good

371
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,880
success stories here all right casey

372
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,360
ellis

373
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,120
he's here bug crowd you know great

374
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,880
success story of folks coming from

375
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,800
australia talent coming from australia

376
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,360
and making big on the world stage so i

377
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,079
feel that

378
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,000
we get to punch above our weight i mean

379
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,120
we've got this tiny

380
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,600
tiny fraction of the people of somewhere

381
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,800
like the u.s

382
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,279
yet we we do get to represent through

383
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,480
initiatives like that

384
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,600
one of the questions that's popped up

385
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,640
here how long until i can look up if my

386
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,519
biometrics

387
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,040
have been pwned and that's i mean that's

388
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,640
the sort of that that's going to be a

389
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,000
space eventually isn't it that's going

390
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,399
to be

391
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,680
something we should be just as worried

392
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,680
about or well

393
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,200
yes and no i think the biometrics is

394
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,360
really interesting so people say

395
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,519
if your biometrics get stolen you can't

396
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:16,560
change it like it

397
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,839
all right first of all you can it's just

398
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,760
not much fun uh but you know you can't

399
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,360
change it like your password

400
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,000
uh so therefore we biometricus is always

401
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,959
identity it should never be

402
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,480
authentication but

403
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,920
these are not like interchangeable

404
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,440
things and there's a really simple test

405
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,160
why

406
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,560
if if you get my password now for a

407
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,279
service

408
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,560
you know immediately what to do with

409
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,920
that let's say you get my netflix

410
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,120
password you sit down there and you go

411
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,440
netflix.com put in the password job done

412
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,920
if you get a good look at my thumb print

413
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,120
what do you do next

414
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,279
right so you gotta and i've never done

415
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,720
this so i've just uh i've just watched

416
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,160
some james bond so i can kind of figure

417
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,560
it out

418
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,760
but what you do is you've got to get a

419
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,120
clean enough print and then you've got

420
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,240
to get gummy bears and you've got to

421
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,120
melt them down and then you've got to

422
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,240
turn them into prosthetic and then

423
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,040
you've got to try and

424
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,360
fool a biometric device and you've got

425
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,800
to do it within x number of goes

426
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,240
otherwise it locks out and falls back to

427
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,600
a pin or something like that

428
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,920
so i don't think we can ever sort of

429
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,480
compare these two the same way

430
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,959
and even if we could no i'm not putting

431
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:10,079
it in have a vampire

432
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,839
imagine sitting on people's fingerprints

433
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,360
or something in there

434
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,639
i've got a question that's just come

435
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,800
through um it's uh

436
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,240
troy you're pretty active on social

437
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,000
media with pictures of your personal

438
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,079
life as a security professional

439
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,720
does that concern you i got a really fun

440
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,440
story about this

441
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,720
so someone was trying to dox me the

442
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
other day and this was after i

443
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,320
i left commentary on gab so if you don't

444
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,639
know what gab is it's where all the

445
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,760
really right

446
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,839
wing particularly very racist leaning

447
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,839
folks went after trump got booted off

448
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:38,959
twitter and they're like oh we'll just

449
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:40,480
go to gab and we can

450
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,040
free speech just be as evil as we want

451
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,760
over there

452
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,600
so anyway uh they had a bridge whole

453
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,519
bunch of stuff leaked and i

454
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,120
i covered it on have a vampire and i

455
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,959
loaded data i left some commentary which

456
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,320
was like 90 percent

457
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,279
just here's the data and 10 here's my

458
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,639
views of gab

459
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,279
and someone got very upset about that uh

460
00:12:59,279 --> 00:12:59,839
and they

461
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,200
they went and they i'm going to air

462
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
quote this they doxed myself

463
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,959
and a whole bunch of other researchers

464
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,399
are involved in this trying to find

465
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,079
every piece of personal information they

466
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:08,800
could

467
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,560
creating a dedicated website putting

468
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,079
photos and stuff up there

469
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,519
and i looked at mine and there's like

470
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,360
photos of my kids there's photos of my

471
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:16,079
fiance

472
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,200
like every single one of these photos i

473
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,079
decided to publish

474
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,519
publicly and you're having so much

475
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,880
trouble now actually figuring out what's

476
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,000
meant to be out there

477
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,399
versus what's actually legitimate boxing

478
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,839
so i actually thought it was very funny

479
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:28,160
and i

480
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,680
it reminded me of something a few years

481
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,279
ago mate of mine said i said

482
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,200
look if you can never remove bad stuff

483
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,639
about you from the internet the only

484
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,440
thing you can do is

485
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,200
flood it with good stuff and then it

486
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,880
makes the bad stuff really hard to find

487
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,079
i'm not saying like there's bad stuff

488
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,279
about me it's rather than on the

489
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,240
internet

490
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,240
but i think when you willingly provide

491
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,600
that much information

492
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,160
it sets that the narrative around your

493
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,279
life

494
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,079
so uh yeah i thought that was funny

495
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,279
trying to dock me with photos i

496
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,920
published

497
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,560
anonymous asks as a regional director of

498
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,440
microsoft

499
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,279
how does or does it at all microsoft

500
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,800
affect the running of the site

501
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,639
or what you cannot do or say in the

502
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,000
public eye

503
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,760
so i'm a microsoft regional director

504
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,600
which means uh i don't have a region i

505
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,800
don't direct anything and i don't work

506
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,639
for microsoft

507
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,399
nice it's like it's a confusing title

508
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:14,959
and like

509
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,560
it's cool and that people go oh cool

510
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,000
this sounds really fancy and like opens

511
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,800
and doors

512
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,519
but it it is like an honorary title if

513
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,680
you go to rd.microsoft.com it explains

514
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,399
what it is

515
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,560
i am entirely independent it's very much

516
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,040
like the mvp program in many ways

517
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,560
and they have absolutely no influence

518
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,839
whatsoever and whatever i do and if

519
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,040
there was a database tomorrow

520
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,880
microsoft.com you'd see that on how i

521
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,000
been phoned

522
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,079
but i do do a lot of stuff with them

523
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,920
they give me some azure credits

524
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,240
uh i think i pay for pretty much

525
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,160
everything else from microsoft but yeah

526
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,079
it's just no influence whatsoever on the

527
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:46,959
way i operate

528
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,000
here's a question that was actually

529
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,519
posted for kieran martin but i'd like to

530
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,880
get your thoughts on it

531
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,199
do we see a time this is jay who asks

532
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,040
this do we see a time

533
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,160
where we'll have an offensive

534
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,160
coordinated response

535
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,079
to root out criminal organizations that

536
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,920
are doing the data breaches or

537
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,839
the hacking or will it always continue

538
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,240
to be this sort of well it's happened

539
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,160
is you know here's your name if you did

540
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,600
get affected um

541
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,519
well that's the way it goes it's

542
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,880
interesting isn't it because we've had

543
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,199
the

544
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,000
the fbi proactively removing web shells

545
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,760
from that exchange hefty and stuff

546
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,279
the other day so maybe that's like a

547
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,279
step in that direction but then

548
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,160
proactively

549
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,519
and offensively rooting them out outside

550
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,440
of a formal law enforcement construct i

551
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,240
don't know that would have been a really

552
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,199
good question for children

553
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,560
of steering actually so yeah where

554
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,800
where are we and what i find fascinating

555
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,320
about this whole space is that

556
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,360
one of the reasons i love coming to

557
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,680
oilseed is i see what you're talking

558
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,079
about

559
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,279
here that then becomes the mainstream

560
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,279
on an 18 month to sort of three year

561
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,560
time lag

562
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,160
you know get this gets out of the real

563
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,800
world and becomes standard practice

564
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,160
where are we at on that journey in this

565
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,920
space is it is it is it

566
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,920
is it static or we will will we be

567
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,199
dealing with these

568
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:00,880
things substantially differently in a

569
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,240
couple of years

570
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,560
i think to to syrian's point before

571
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,399
about learning from the 2016 election

572
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,519
and then things being very different in

573
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,160
2020

574
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,079
it's showing that we're evolving and

575
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,519
learning because everything around us

576
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,000
is evolving very quickly and i think

577
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,680
what makes this industry particularly

578
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,040
fascinating is that that

579
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,199
every day it feels like every day anyway

580
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,480
you get up and you go i didn't see that

581
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,079
coming like that was new this has gone

582
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,600
in a different direction

583
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,519
so i imagine if we look back at this in

584
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,519
18 months it will be like looking back

585
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,920
18 months in the past where we go well

586
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,440
things have progressed

587
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,399
some things have gotten worse

588
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,480
something's gotten better this one

589
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,920
considering the amount of invaluable

590
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,199
information you've received and held

591
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,160
over the years

592
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,560
how are you able to do this legally have

593
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,079
you had any problems

594
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,279
that's a good question are there any

595
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,839
other questions

596
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,240
i think it's a the answer is a

597
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,079
combination of things so as many people

598
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,440
know i was going through a

599
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:54,800
merger and acquisition process with have

600
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,240
a vampire a couple years ago i was just

601
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,680
getting so big i was all right let's go

602
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,240
and

603
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,079
find a new home fred a home that can

604
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,360
help it grow

605
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,040
uh and thank god that didn't happen for

606
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,559
various reasons come and ask me later at

607
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,839
dinner if you want to know

608
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,760
but uh one of the things we learned

609
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,000
through that as kpmg went through this

610
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,919
this sort of basically pitching the

611
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,839
whole thing and we had all these lawyers

612
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,039
pouring over it and everyone's trying to

613
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,720
figure out this question it's like

614
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,280
is it legal to run this service and

615
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,880
lawyers being lawyers they came up with

616
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,000
the position of

617
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,679
we invite bidders to form their own

618
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,520
opinion on the legality of the service

619
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,039
which is basically ah why don't i work

620
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,319
it out for yourselves

621
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,160
and even if we had got to a conclusion

622
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,400
it's like legal where we're

623
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,160
much more liberal with privacy law in

624
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,520
australia than what they are

625
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,120
in europe in europe in general is more

626
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,559
liberal than germany and that's

627
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,559
different to other parts of the world

628
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,240
so to be honest i just keep coming back

629
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,160
to this prior it's like look

630
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,520
data breaches have happened what's the

631
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,200
best thing that we can do now

632
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,480
and at the moment i think this is the

633
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,840
best thing we can do now and if it gets

634
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,120
to the point where someone says look you

635
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,880
just can't do that anymore well

636
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,400
okay we won't be able to do that anymore

637
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,360
and hopefully we'll be able to find

638
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,400
another way of doing it

639
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,520
is it the sort of thing you talk about

640
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,799
that making it bigger and having a

641
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,000
platform for it to grow

642
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,400
is there i mean has this ever had the

643
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,679
potential to be another one billion

644
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:04,320
dollar

645
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,320
unicorn it's going to be nice but it's

646
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,360
one of those interesting things isn't it

647
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,080
because i find

648
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,760
in in the broader sort of digital space

649
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,600
sometimes like you look at things

650
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,039
happening in cryptos and nfts at the

651
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,799
moment things that i struggle to see

652
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,640
what the actual value is being valued

653
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,919
off the planet

654
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,520
the same time something like this that

655
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,240
does such an important

656
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,000
job but possibly isn't that easily

657
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,640
i know i know that's not your drive in

658
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,760
doing it but is it the sort of thing

659
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,240
that would be

660
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,880
easy to monetize but it's a good

661
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,400
question because that came up a lot

662
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
during this this m a process which was

663
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,679
where was the value and

664
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,840
the really interesting conclusion out of

665
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,120
that was that a lot of the

666
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,160
is in in trust and brand of me running

667
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,840
hello bing pong because every time we

668
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,480
went well

669
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,320
what if you just took heavy bampon and

670
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,919
and you know i got from a jet ski for

671
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,360
the rest of eternity or whatever

672
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,640
and everyone's like nah like just

673
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,240
there's just there's just nothing in it

674
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,120
so that

675
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,880
it seems to be the trust in people

676
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,080
popping up and going i would like to

677
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,520
give this data to detroit so that we can

678
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,799
then do something with it

679
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,240
which is really interesting because then

680
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,919
you go okay well

681
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,160
monetization side aside like where do we

682
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,200
go with this how do we

683
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,039
how do we make this thing so ultimately

684
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,640
become self-sustaining

685
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,440
without me because i have like one one

686
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,039
bad jet ski accident and that's like

687
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,400
what happens now

688
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,160
i like that there was one question here

689
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,080
in when testifying before congress

690
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,160
how many variations of the word pwned

691
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,679
were there and someone else asked have

692
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:24,880
you thought of changing it to have i

693
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,280
been

694
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,480
wrecked rekt to keep up with the young

695
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,039
people

696
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,919
um i mean i love the use of the word

697
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:32,880
pwned

698
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,880
in it where did that come from and is

699
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,480
that that is part of the sort of

700
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,520
beautiful attraction of the whole

701
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,400
project

702
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,080
because i never expected it to do

703
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,520
anything i really didn't give it much

704
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,360
thought i was just like i need a domain

705
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,280
yeah i always try to buy a domain name

706
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,679
lately it's like this is so hard it's ah

707
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,440
this one's available i'll just take that

708
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,799
and i never really thought much more

709
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:51,440
about it

710
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,200
and then over the years of course people

711
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,480
have come up with all of these

712
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,480
variations in their pronunciation so i

713
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,720
own so many bloody domain names because

714
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,080
of the way it's pronounced it's like

715
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,559
i have have i been pawned spelt exactly

716
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,679
as you expected to be

717
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:05,520
i have have i been prawned because

718
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:06,960
americans

719
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,320
and then there's all these other kind of

720
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,000
strange variations and and every now and

721
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,600
then someone says oh maybe you should

722
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,840
change the name to be like more socially

723
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,720
acceptable

724
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,960
i'll be like no this is fun i like this

725
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,080
name why would i do that

726
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,200
couple of quick ones uh dushant asks

727
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,559
what's your opinion

728
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,480
on passwordless authentication

729
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,320
especially the two-factor authentication

730
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:26,880
shift

731
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,919
to what you have and what you are so in

732
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,520
in a nutshell i love the technical

733
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,880
implementation i think it's the

734
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,960
usability side of it which is difficult

735
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,159
if you don't believe me try and set it

736
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,360
up for my parents so here you go with

737
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,080
that

738
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,720
uh i think it will be a larger part of

739
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,799
things over time but the one thing that

740
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,280
passwords have going for them which

741
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,880
which so far nothing else has been able

742
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,640
to do is usability and i mean that's

743
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,400
simply because all of this can go to our

744
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,080
parents or our less technical relatives

745
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,280
or wherever else it may be

746
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,880
and go do you know how to use a password

747
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,400
and then they go yep fine

748
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,480
do you know how to use a uterf key a

749
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,919
what now or a soft token

750
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,919
try migrating someone's soft token after

751
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,520
they've migrated their phone and they

752
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,960
didn't migrate the token and they didn't

753
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,320
save the backup codes

754
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,480
and so yeah i think we're stuck with

755
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,679
passwords for a long time because of

756
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:10,159
that

757
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,600
anonymous how do you deal with gdp

758
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,159
r we invite bidders to form their own

759
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,880
opinion of gdpr

760
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,960
so i've actually had uh multiple

761
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,799
discussions with with regulators in the

762
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,559
eu and with folks in gdpr

763
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,480
and i've literally had this discussion

764
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,880
of data breaches are happening

765
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,559
they kind of don't comply with gdpr

766
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,080
because hackers

767
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,760
what should we do now what is the best

768
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,200
thing to do with the fact that there's

769
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,720
all this data floating around

770
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,559
and frankly even regulators can't wrap

771
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,840
their head around

772
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,760
what do we do after this illegal

773
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,039
activity happens

774
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,600
so it literally just boils down to that

775
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,440
the legal basis for processing

776
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,840
uh was uh it's one of the five and gdp

777
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,440
powers basically the one which is that

778
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,360
this is a a community service which

779
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,720
requires data in order to operate this

780
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,280
way

781
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,880
if anyone gets upset we provide the

782
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,320
provisions to be a we

783
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,240
may provide the provisions to be able to

784
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,440
remove the data

785
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,640
and then we hope it doesn't get worse

786
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,200
david o'brien asks why are we losing the

787
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,880
ransomware battle despite

788
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,120
all our good work and to quote our prime

789
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,640
minister do you accept the premise of

790
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,840
the question that we are losing the

791
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,799
ransomware battle

792
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,559
and if so why are we do we spot all our

793
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,480
good work i i feel like it's the

794
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,120
question of

795
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,280
of are we losing the battle against

796
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,960
clipping our fingernails why do i have

797
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,400
to keep clipping my damn fingernails

798
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,280
every time i do

799
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,520
i've got to clip my fingernails it's one

800
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,360
of these things which i think has to be

801
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,159
maintained

802
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,960
you're like you can't just stop or it

803
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,400
continues

804
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,840
you never get to the point where it no

805
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,280
longer happens anymore and i think what

806
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,559
we're doing with transformer is maybe

807
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,159
just changing some of the roi

808
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,360
and i mean as an example of that

809
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,760
ransomware in recent years has gone from

810
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,799
being attacks against

811
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,720
availability to attacks against

812
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,960
availability and confidentiality so we

813
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,080
get things like that finished

814
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,600
psychotherapy thing the other day where

815
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,120
it's like hey we've ransomed your data

816
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,080
please give us bitcoin

817
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,320
no okay we'll just go to every

818
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,600
individual in the data breach and ask

819
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,039
them for bitcoin otherwise we dump their

820
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,159
psychotherapy records

821
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,360
a couple of quick ones to finish do you

822
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,760
think cloud-based mfa services like

823
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,880
i think it says authy authy are a major

824
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,240
security risk i think they change

825
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,039
security

826
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,039
because you're saying would we rather i

827
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,960
mean auth is is usually soft taken for

828
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,320
two-factor authentication but if we look

829
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,400
at other means of authentication where

830
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,760
we consolidate both into one location

831
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,840
you put a lot of eggs in one basket but

832
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,440
then look at the places you take the

833
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,320
eggs away from

834
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,000
how good a job and many websites doing

835
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,919
of actually maintaining our usernames

836
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,600
and our passwords and everything so we

837
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,200
change the risk as opposed to

838
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,559
necessarily making it holistically

839
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,480
better or bad there were a couple of

840
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,600
different questions i'll alter them

841
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,159
together

842
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,919
one question was did you drive your jet

843
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,440
ski to the conference another question

844
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:41,919
was

845
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,279
are you still offering the guitar

846
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:44,799
lessons and another question was the

847
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,480
rest of us males are going bald

848
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,000
how the heck do you keep that perfect

849
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,080
head of hair can i suggest

850
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,279
the perfect head of hair has something

851
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,640
to do with the fact that you ride a jet

852
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,279
ski

853
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,279
and play the guitar is it just a general

854
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,720
lifestyle thing it seems like things are

855
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,159
working all right for you in 2021 you've

856
00:23:58,159 --> 00:23:59,200
got a fiance

857
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,039
you've got your jet ski you're given

858
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,720
guitar lessons you've got the perfect

859
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,640
head of hair we hate you

860
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:08,000
um i think it sounds like things are in

861
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,919
a good place for you at the moment

862
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,919
i don't play guitar if anyone wants to

863
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,760
know that like google my name guitarist

864
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,559
it's a ricky gervais joke but uh yeah

865
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,320
for the most part things are pretty good

866
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,159
excellent what's your take-home message

867
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,760
from all of this space

868
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,960
for for the audience here i

869
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,640
honestly i think the take-home message

870
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,480
is that this is a very good industry to

871
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,200
be in

872
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,520
at the moment i mean it is amazing when

873
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,799
you look at it right like the amount of

874
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,480
opportunity in this industry and it just

875
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:35,760
gets bigger and bigger and bigger and

876
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,480
bigger

877
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,080
and it's you know you could sit there on

878
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,520
the one hand and go is it crap we're

879
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,559
getting hacked by everyone and then

880
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,840
there's russians and all the rest of it

881
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,720
or you can go

882
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,080
isn't this wonderful there's so much

883
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,360
opportunity and it's such an exciting

884
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,039
place to be in

885
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,120
