1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:02,639
um and the next speaker is coming in

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:03,280
from

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,560
virtual space so we have a zooming in

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,559
so hopefully there's no issues with zoom

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:12,960
cool so without further ado we have two

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,160
speakers so

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,880
prescott pym and bruce biseka i'm really

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,199
hoping i'm pronouncing that correctly

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,640
around how not to run a sock so prescott

what we wanted to do

44
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,079
as uh the introduction has been doing

45
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,439
this for

46
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,640
decades now and we run nine

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,759
global security operations centers and

48
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,320
what we wanted to do is to talk about

49
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,560
how not to run a sock i think there's

50
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,799
we've seen lots of ways in which

51
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,799
socks are run and want to try to

52
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,000
share some of the knowledge and

53
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,159
experience that we have and the things

54
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,520
that you should try to avoid and

55
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,680
hopefully make it simpler for you

56
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,878

uh yeah usually i'm on the receiving end

77
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,239
of those sort of calls so

78
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,840
there's a bit of a bit of payback for me

79
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,920
but uh and also you've survived your

80
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,000
your covered jab the second one so you

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,200
know hopefully you can hold out for the

82
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,879
whole session

83
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,519
that'd be great thank you next slide

84
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,840
please

85
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,120
so what's a verizon uh

86
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,760
let's go to the next slide we uh verizon

87
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,239
is a

88
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,640
it's a household name in the us but uh

89
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,599
outside the us

90
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,440
not too much um 99

91
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,879
of the fortune 500 are points of verizon

92
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,000
we are a

93
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,239
global telecommunications companies

94
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,239
america we are a fortune

95
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,440
13 company and the business unit that

96
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,840
prescott and i work for which is

97
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,400
a verizon business group if it was cut

98
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,080
out from verizon

99
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,360
itself would be a fortune 100 company

100
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,879
we work in 150 countries

101
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,000
there's over 4300

102
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,040
networks managed globally our current

103
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,599
market cap is about

104
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:03,519
250 billion dollars

105
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,400
as stated earlier we and for the managed

106
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,159
security services

107
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,200
uh have nine security operation centers

108
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,560
and the reason i want to say managed

109
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,360
security services is verizon as a whole

110
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,759
we have multiple security teams there's

111
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,600
corporate security under the office of

112
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,040
the cso

113
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,120
that's working against and and helping

114
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,080
to protect

115
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,199
uh billing centers

116
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,520
you know end devices we have their

117
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,639
network team

118
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,680
uh to ensure that attacks that are

119
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,440
happening are not spreading across the

120
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,160
network

121
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,320
we have our professional services and

122
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,240
prescott and iron and managed services

123
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,240
where we are providing security services

124
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,639
to enterprise clients

125
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,000
on a monthly basis we see well over 2.7

126
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,120
trillion events that come through

127
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,880
our systems that we are processing and

128
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,320
handling

129
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,479
from the telecommunications standpoint

130
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,960
over 1.4 million kilometers

131
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,759
of fiber around the globe and we have

132
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,039
over 135

133
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:10,400
000 global employees next slide please

134
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,960
that's fine

135
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,960
so the complexity of security

136
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,240
right on here it's uh

137
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,479
off to the right you can see it is who

138
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,000
led the plans for

139
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,199
your security events this year right was

140
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,240
it the ceo is it the cto is the cso

141
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,960
or was it coded and i think we all

142
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,600
learned that

143
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,800
we had to had to deal with this

144
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,280
and it's the unknown unknowns that

145
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,039
really drive security

146
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,800
right the the thought that digital

147
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,280
transformation is someone else's job

148
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,479
uh the concern a lot of times that sock

149
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:49,199
teams are

150
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,880
disconnected from the wider business

151
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,160
and as we all had to deal with covid

152
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,360
and work from home remote access

153
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,880
services

154
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,520
we had to deal many times working with

155
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,800
clients where

156
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,479
they would tell us things that we had to

157
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,000
get the network up we had to get people

158
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,880
working

159
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,680
we'll worry about the security later now

160
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,759
security professionals

161
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,319
that was heresy but understood what they

162
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,680
were doing

163
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,880
and but it's also the complexity there's

164
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,400
so many things there's so many new

165
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,600
devices uh

166
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,960
you know moving to the cloud the

167
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,919
transformation and complexity

168
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,120
is also adding to the unknowns that are

169
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,720
out there

170
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,960
next

171
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,520
yeah and um yeah just to reinforce that

172
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,280
fact i think bruce that if you

173
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,960
had not to run the sock is to ignore

174
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,400
those unknowns unknowns

175
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,600
you've got to go uh seeking out

176
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,120
how can i how can i cover across all

177
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,960
those bases um

178
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,639
it's actually a really important day for

179
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,720
verizon uh today and we'll talk

180
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,840
a bit about this through the

181
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,160
presentation but each year for the last

182
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,319
14 years we've released the data breach

183
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,840
investigations report which is a bit of

184
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:02,960
a bible for

185
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,560
what's happening uh out there in the

186
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,160
security world

187
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,720
so one of the the charts i thought was

188
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,560
really interesting to pull out from here

189
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,560
uh from uh the impact of covert 19

190
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,479
was you know what what happened in terms

191
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
of trends of events

192
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,479
over the past 12 months and i don't

193
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:21,599
think it's going to be a surprise to

194
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,240
anyone

195
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,639
sitting in the room there uh around you

196
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,080
know the fact that there's been uptick

197
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,000
in fishing and ransomware

198
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,479
uh yeah these are the stats we draw

199
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:31,599
globally from

200
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,599
both as bruce mentioned our own network

201
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,360
our own managed services and then

202
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,840
partnerships with uh companies around

203
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,479
the globe

204
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,880
uh in australia here uh stake up in

205
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,759
victoria

206
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,240
paraflare have been contributing as well

207
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,680
as regional assets

208
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,919
from around the region so you know

209
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,520
fishing in ransomware have seen upticks

210
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,319
of you know

211
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,919
10 5 from from our stats from last year

212
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,479
but it's also interesting to see that

213
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,000
some of the misconfiguration the missed

214
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,039
delivery of uh uh uh

215
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,240
emails and things like that have

216
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,160
actually gone down i think that

217
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,319
bruce's point goes to show that a lot of

218
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,840
organizations are starting to

219
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,080
to think about this a bit more uh

220
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,440
putting in place the right government

221
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,639
structures to make sure that their

222
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,879
security operations teams are watching

223
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,560
for you know this can be good events

224
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,080
that are going on in the network

225
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,039
bruce anything you want to add to that

226
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:23,759
no i think

227
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,520
i think that look we're dealing with an

228
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,440
issue right now here in the states where

229
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,000
uh

230
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,319
one of the companies that's dealing with

231
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:32,799
the pipeline of uh

232
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:35,120
gas that goes from the gulf of mexico

233
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,719
all the way up to new york

234
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,360
and was shut down by ransomware just

235
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,360
came out today that they did end up

236
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,559
paying

237
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,080
5 million to the dark side for this

238
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,120
and there are gas shortages

239
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,959
on the east coast it also shows the

240
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,560
delicate nature of this and the

241
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,399
infrastructure and

242
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,880
how you know people are getting the bad

243
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,720
guys are getting smarter it's also it's

244
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,279
a business model if you look at this

245
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:04,880
and that's the other one that's driving

246
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,279
this which is it's a ransomware as a

247
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,839
service and you see ddos as a service

248
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,640
and they're you know they are really

249
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,320
they the hackers and the bad people are

250
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,480
turning us into a lucrative business on

251
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,440
their side

252
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,399
uh and you know on one hand it's very

253
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,200
scary to see how uh professional

254
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,800
they are at this and but it's uh

255
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,000
it's real impacting

256
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,720
next slide please

257
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,160
so on this one we might touch

258
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,680
base on input and just adding more

259
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,360
does not necessarily equal output

260
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,959
next slide please so

261
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,920
more visibility does not equal more

262
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,959
security

263
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,920
right garbage and garbage out what we're

264
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,040
seeing is

265
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,920
and prescott will touch on this later on

266
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,600
in the presentation is

267
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,120
there's the uh the false belief that if

268
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,040
i just get more logs

269
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,920
and i get that from every device and i

270
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,800
just pull this

271
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,360
in that suddenly i'm going to be

272
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,880
protected

273
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,519
you get the overload of the false

274
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,560
positives which

275
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,720
drive the sock then there now they're

276
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,240
responding just to more

277
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,720
and more and more and not necessarily

278
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,360
the

279
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,240
you know quantity does not equal quality

280
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,200
at all

281
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,040
and it's it is it's redefining the

282
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,120
needle in the haystack now

283
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,600
what you've done is instead of me making

284
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,200
it easier to find that needle you've

285
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,720
just made the haystack

286
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,279
10 times larger and you're still looking

287
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,200
for the needle

288
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,519
add to that the extra cost that you're

289
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,800
going to have of

290
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,680
the storage you have to index all of the

291
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:48,720
logs

292
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,920
and then you have to have the team

293
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,600
that's going to be running on this and

294
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,160
it's

295
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,880
totally inundating them so one of the

296
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,320
biggest

297
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,440
issues that we see out of socks

298
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,560
and the improvement is they need to work

299
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,279
with the

300
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,800
security engineers with the different

301
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,880
systems with it with dev

302
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,600
on the cloud and on the prem to define

303
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,760
what are truly the logs that they should

304
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,640
be getting

305
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:14,480
and pull those in so that they can take

306
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,560
action on those

307
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,359
next flight please

308
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,440
yeah so this is um something that i

309
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,880
wanted to to step through

310
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,040
uh just you know this is how my mindset

311
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,079
works when

312
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,160
uh i'm thinking about what is what is

313
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,760
information what is relevant

314
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,480
for for a sock so sort of starting at

315
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,360
the base here

316
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,279
i've actually used this sort of

317
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,720
well-known uh

318
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,560
you know information hierarchy triangle

319
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,399
uh sort of coined by akov in

320
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,440
1989 he was an information scientist uh

321
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,560
where we talk about

322
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,399
you know what is what is data how does

323
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,160
that become become wisdom

324
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,760
so if we're thinking about it from a

325
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,519
sock perspective you know at the bottom

326
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,639
of the triangle here

327
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,519
we've got a ton of data and it's

328
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,720
building up more and more

329
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,560
you know organizations now building data

330
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,760
lakes uh

331
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,160
to you know keep that uh that's

332
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,240
separated from their scenes because

333
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,680
it's too expensive to run a scene with

334
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,160
all the information you need to put

335
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:10,800
through it

336
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,320
we see a lot of customers these days

337
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,720
that um you're really scrutinizing

338
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,160
what's going to be the input into their

339
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,560
scene because it's expensive to pay for

340
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,200
it but

341
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,920
you know we're swimming in this uh this

342
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,639
c

343
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,440
or data lake of information and drowning

344
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,560
many cases

345
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,440
so i'm just going to sort of run through

346
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:29,839
how

347
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,000
how that's going to map to the stock so

348
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,959
let's

349
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,480
take for instance that we think about

350
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,800
the iocs that we might get from

351
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,639
for intel as raw data on the network

352
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:42,959
by itself without any context it's

353
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,079
really meaningless

354
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,680
uh yeah it's great we've got an id

355
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,200
address or a hash but

356
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,839
what does that mean uh if we move up

357
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,680
then into the information section if you

358
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,720
wouldn't mind

359
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,600
moving the transition thank you uh you

360
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,079
sort of got

361
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,320
the ioc you've got an information

362
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
information about what that threat might

363
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:00,959
be

364
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,639
that's starting to pull some of that

365
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,320
together uh to make

366
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,760
some context for for the sock and

367
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,200
the business environment there so you're

368
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,920
connecting you know maybe a couple of

369
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,639
information

370
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,639
correlating that together coming to some

371
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,160
sort of conclusion hey there might be

372
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,200
something going on

373
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,600
in the environment here that's great and

374
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,800
it's good to know

375
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,800
it's actionable information for for the

376
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,240
sock analyst we actually need to

377
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,600
go up another step uh and

378
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,360
you know think about okay what is the

379
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,959
actor and what are their

380
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,279
tactics techniques procedures that

381
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,639
they're running through

382
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,920
um how is that going to be a threat to

383
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,120
the business not just the sock this is

384
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,160
starting to get into the realm of

385
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,000
knowledge we've actually got

386
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,320
some sort of idea of what we need to

387
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,760
protect against

388
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,240
and then stepping up from that we need

389
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,160
to move from knowledge into wisdom

390
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,279
and wisdom is where you can take actions

391
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:56,240
that will protect you

392
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,920
into the future and this is where we

393
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,600
need to start to integrate

394
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,839
these sorts of things into as we the

395
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:02,800
theme of the conference

396
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,680
saw platforms uh protections in place if

397
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,440
we think about the nist framework

398
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,040
you know protect is right up there at

399
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,720
the front so uh

400
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,800
this is how we we get that base

401
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,560
information the data the is at the

402
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:14,959
bottom

403
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,959
alternatively into wisdom that provides

404
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,079
value to the organization

405
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,720
anything you want to add there bruce oh

406
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,680
i think it's

407
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,839
um it just goes to the point of the of

408
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:26,880
the data

409
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,680
and the overloading of the data and

410
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,880
clearly

411
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,959
what it is is as you've identified it's

412
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,639
pulling in the threat

413
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,600
and the knowledge and then getting to

414
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,399
that point

415
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,199
and as you see just adding more data at

416
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,880
the bottom doesn't get you to that

417
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,000
wisdom

418
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,040
and it's really about leveraging the

419
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,079
frameworks and definitely what we view

420
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:51,839
as a key differentiator is the sore

421
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,160
tools

422
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,639
next slide please

423
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,079
so empire state and the other big

424
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:02,720
mistake

425
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,760
is trying to uh

426
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,720
build empires just to handle the work

427
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,839
next slide please

428
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,240
so you know the a lot of people

429
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,399
think that uh you know automation right

430
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,079
destroy all humans and

431
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,760
uh as you can see it off to the right

432
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,000
there it's the uh unfortunately it's the

433
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,600
soccer analyst playing whack-a-mole

434
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,639
right trying to respond to the iocs

435
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,360
um you don't do automation just because

436
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,880
it's a buzzword

437
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,360
and what you really have to do is

438
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,199
you know people have to take a look at

439
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:38,839
this and you have to get the right risk

440
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:40,240
exposure

441
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,040
and just as throwing more data at a

442
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,000
problem

443
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,800
doesn't solve it you need to have the

444
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,519
you know

445
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,519
the defense in depth but also you need

446
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,519
to understand and go through

447
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,079
and identify right what are the assets

448
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:54,560
that are

449
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,639
most at risk i know this to this

450
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,560
audience especially sounds like blocking

451
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,920
and tackling not telling you anything

452
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,800
but

453
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,240
this really is overseen so many times

454
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,160
and you have to understand the assets

455
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,320
and then what is that exposure

456
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,440
um you also have to put in the time for

457
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,880
the processes

458
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,759
right if if you don't have a process and

459
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:17,279
it's not standardized and it's not

460
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,720
standardized globally

461
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,240
you're not going to be able to automate

462
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,079
the work the other downside about um

463
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,839
automation is if you don't do it right

464
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,360
the great thing about automation is you

465
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,160
can do something

466
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:30,639
ten thousand times in a minute the bad

467
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,360
thing is

468
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,600
if you don't do it well and correct you

469
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,279
can make ten thousand errors

470
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,560
in a minute and that's where you

471
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,519
have to have your automation and if

472
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,880
you're using soar

473
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,360
in playbooks you have to put that

474
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,160
through the same

475
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,519
itil process peer review change

476
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,800
management

477
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,160
into dev into staging into uh and into

478
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,360
production

479
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,120
you don't want to have someone just

480
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,959
sitting there designing a playbook on

481
00:16:58,959 --> 00:16:59,360
their

482
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,399
own you know hitting run and

483
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,359
you know takes down systems and finally

484
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,959
the the last one

485
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,000
and we'll touch on sort in a in a in a

486
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,520
few slides here but

487
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,640
throwing bodies is at the sock is

488
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,119
it's not the solution that is not going

489
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,000
to

490
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,400
get you anywhere yes there are times and

491
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,599
when you're going through explosive

492
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,039
growth you need to add it

493
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,760
but adding bodies just to handle that

494
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,199
data pyramid

495
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,000
is absolutely the wrong answer because

496
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,240
you're just going to be exacerbating

497
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,919
the problem the problem is not going

498
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,160
away if anything now it's worse because

499
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,840
now you have 20 people that are having

500
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,760
the same problem as opposed to 12 people

501
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,559
that were

502
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,280
having the problem next slide please

503
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,120
the prescott here you want to take this

504
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,679
one yeah that and going directly on from

505
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:50,880
what you said there bruce

506
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,640
yeah just throwing lots of bodies that

507
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,960
it just you know that contributes to

508
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,480
cycle burnout which

509
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,160
for many security operations managers in

510
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,760
the audience there um

511
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,679
you know no it's it's one of the

512
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,960
challenges of our time managing

513
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,559
technical teams

514
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:08,080
um yeah so soft turnover is a challenge

515
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,559
and

516
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,480
i'm sitting here and i was standing here

517
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,600
in our sock in

518
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,160
in canberra uh and we haven't automated

519
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:14,799
anything

520
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,160
everything you know that's not why you

521
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,919
don't see people in the background here

522
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,120
they're just hiding but

523
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,760
uh yeah i i found this a really

524
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,480
interesting

525
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,080
um graphic to talk to you know where do

526
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,640
you need to focus your sock resources

527
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,559
um this is from a report that was done

528
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,840
by the scientia

529
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,240
institute a couple of years ago uh wade

530
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,280
baker who

531
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,799
used to run the data breach

532
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,280
investigations report from verizon

533
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,080
went out to about 190 different socks

534
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,400
and

535
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,280
uh you know tried to get some uh

536
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,080
quantitative data not qualitatively data

537
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,559
around what's what's driving uh socks

538
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,080
where should people focus

539
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,039
and as we can see here hopefully you can

540
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:57,520
see that

541
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,360
on the bottom left you know what what do

542
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,799
you think you might need to automate

543
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,600
from your sock perspective and sort of

544
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,240
you know the

545
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,640
the reporting the really mundane sort of

546
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,520
stuff that

547
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,600
stock analysts hate doing um that's the

548
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,720
sort of stuff you can

549
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,200
drive through soil platforms then we get

550
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,200
up into the orchestration layers

551
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,039
where sort of you know your vau type

552
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,799
activity for the sock is but where we

553
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,480
really want to get to and

554
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,440
sort of thinking back to the the the

555
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,200
knowledge triangle there your wisdom

556
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,440
intuition that's what you want to be

557
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,440
driving from your sock analysts and

558
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,760
yeah bruce likes to use this one so i'll

559
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,720
use it here is

560
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,760
you know we want the analysts to be

561
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,240
using their big brains on on the right

562
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,280
activities

563
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,240
and um you know that that sort of the

564
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,440
hunting and

565
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,039
those type of activities up in the top

566
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,799
right corner there uh

567
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,679
yeah is is where the human analysts can

568
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,039
provide value and it's what really

569
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,120
drives the teams as well that's the sort

570
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,080
of stuff that they

571
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,640
they love doing so you know they're

572
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,559
focusing on those right areas

573
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,200
and also focusing on what is relevant

574
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,000
for

575
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,440
the business the organization that

576
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,120
you're trying to protect you know you

577
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,320
can't just think of it from a

578
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,400
technical perspective it goes back to i

579
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,679
think in the last slide we talked a bit

580
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:08,320
about

581
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,120
risks and yeah what's happening across

582
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,679
the organization

583
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,919
yeah on that one and i think it's it's a

584
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,840
great point on there about engaging

585
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,039
um smart people right so what do smart

586
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,880
people like to do they like to solve

587
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,919
problems um what the smart people

588
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,200
not like to do is just the the medial

589
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,159
tasks

590
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,520
and where we've been leveraging soar

591
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,640
is to take care of

592
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,480
you know the busy work right so an

593
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,400
incident investigation you might have to

594
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,000
go to iprep the url

595
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,400
wrap in you know dark web searches and

596
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,440
everything else

597
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,840
but going back to the standard to the

598
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,760
process and procedures we know the

599
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,200
things that we're going to look for we

600
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,720
know how

601
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,120
so we can take all of that and remove

602
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,480
the swivel chair

603
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,159
and the cutting and pasting and

604
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,640
everything else that drives an analyst

605
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,000
crazy because they're not

606
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,760
adding value they're not engaging their

607
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,880
cerebral material right the gray matter

608
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,960
what we want to do and what we've been

609
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,280
working on and successful at is

610
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,919
as those you know repeated things come

611
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:14,720
in

612
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,799
that's automated so when an analyst

613
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,559
looks at the incident

614
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,320
they've all that work's been done so

615
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,240
they can immediately engage and then we

616
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,320
can take this and put into a nist

617
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,679
framework a miter attack

618
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,320
framework whatever makes the most sense

619
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,480
for the client and the situation

620
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,559
but they can engage and immediately

621
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,400
start to work the problem so

622
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,760
not only is it saving time but it's also

623
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,400
saving frustration from the employees

624
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,480
and not having to do it you know

625
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,440
prescott was

626
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,960
pointing out on the bottom left where

627
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,039
you're doing you know the the reporting

628
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:47,840
and that stuff

629
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,640
you're actually getting up into um you

630
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,039
know that knowledge and then the wisdom

631
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,880
and then the continuous improvement on

632
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,120
that

633
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,320
next slide please

634
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,440
so now that we kind of told you the

635
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,880
problems some of the other stuff

636
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,039
how do we fix this next slide

637
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,480
so you have to understand your wrist

638
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,280
posture

639
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,919
if you don't know the company that

640
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:16,320
you're

641
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,919
in and the attack vectors

642
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,559
um is in the data breach investigations

643
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:23,200
report

644
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,039
in there and they've been doing it this

645
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,880
is the 14th edition they break it down

646
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:27,280
by

647
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,320
industries and different industries

648
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:33,679
have different attack you know vectors

649
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:34,159
on it

650
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,760
that doesn't mean that you can't have

651
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,080
one out of here but

652
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,280
no company has an infinite risk you know

653
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,200
amount of resources that they can throw

654
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,559
at all problems

655
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,679
so what we're trying to say is

656
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,880
take the money that you have and if you

657
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,520
were in

658
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,559
you know transportation and these are

659
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,640
the most common attack vectors

660
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,640
and you have limited budget then go in

661
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,240
and do the work and research and

662
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,480
understand and how to protect those

663
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,159
the other thing is that's on here and

664
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:05,840
you know once again we'll find is 85

665
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,480
percent of

666
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,120
involved a human element right there's

667
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,039
either that that's that's fishing or

668
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:12,080
it's a manual

669
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,679
air um you need to understand what these

670
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:16,640
are

671
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,280
ransomware uh you know it doesn't have

672
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,240
to

673
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,559
get as you know too successful but once

674
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:23,280
it gets in

675
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,120
it can spread and it can do a lot of

676
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,320
damage

677
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,880
there are and it's still financially

678
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,080
motivated right

679
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,480
well you know why did people you know in

680
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,000
wild west go and uh

681
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,559
you know hold up the the stagecoach

682
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,240
because that's where the money was

683
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,400
and now they're going after the the

684
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,559
banks and it's also the others we found

685
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,400
and talked about it earlier

686
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,960
some of the organizations now have you

687
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,520
know

688
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,240
criminals as a service or criminal

689
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,559
activity as a service ransomware ddos as

690
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:53,440
a service

691
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,559
so you need to understand that why

692
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,760
people are going to be coming

693
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,559
after you how to protect it and how to

694
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,120
drive

695
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,960
and how to take limited resources and

696
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,039
put it into the best possibility that

697
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,240
you can respond to that

698
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,000
yeah and the other thing i'll just i'll

699
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,760
just i'll just add there bruce as we're

700
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,400
transitioning

701
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,440
is yeah yeah um i'm i'm doing my my mba

702
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,679
at the moment and the bigger

703
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:20,080
to say for my it governance lecturer

704
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,120
that you know

705
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,799
uh what you're doing the socks should

706
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,320
link back to the organization's

707
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,000
enterprise risk management

708
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,799
uh strategy from a business perspective

709
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:29,760
not just from a

710
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,520
from an i.t perspective that's a that's

711
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,240
a critical link you're making sure that

712
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,240
you're addressing what specific needs of

713
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,400
the business are

714
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,520
now excellent

715
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,400
all right next slide please

716
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,240
so what does it look like for asia

717
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,000
pacific you know what are the types of

718
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,679
risks that that you might see and need

719
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,679
to be worried about um

720
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,320
there's a lot of fine print here by all

721
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,000
means go down download the report

722
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
send me an email i'll send it to you uh

723
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,120
if you like um

724
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,840
but uh yeah there's one thing that was

725
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,600
interesting in our data set was this

726
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,559
year there are actually

727
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,720
more breaches in asia pacific than they

728
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,000
were in any other region

729
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,320
in our data set and i think you know the

730
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,919
number of contributors in region was

731
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:14,880
around

732
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,000
20 out of 83

733
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,320
so as you can see they're regionally

734
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,360
focused

735
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,760
there's a much higher risk of exposure

736
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,240
to a data breach

737
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,360
70 of those attacks in apac had a social

738
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:30,000
engineering

739
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,600
action associated with them so that

740
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,679
could be a phishing email

741
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,279
it could be an attempted business email

742
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,360
compromise um

743
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,880
but the interesting part there is that

744
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,039
those attacks almost exclusively

745
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,039
harvested credentials that's that's the

746
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:43,919
focus

747
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,919
of where attackers are going after and

748
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,240
then using those credentials to escalate

749
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,960
um and compromise web-based applications

750
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,320
particularly in cloud

751
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,039
um as well so there's some really

752
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,320
interesting takeaways

753
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,080
um asia pacific is a little bit

754
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,440
different from from the rest of the

755
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,080
world

756
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,880
uh but comparing to the us for instance

757
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,799
i think uh social engineering actions

758
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:05,440
were

759
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,960
present in about 35 of uh of breaches so

760
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,240
it's definitely something

761
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,440
to be concerned out here

762
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,200
absolutely next place all right thanks

763
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,039
um so one of the other things we talked

764
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:20,240
about was

765
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,679
uh you know more logs does not

766
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,000
necessarily make more visibility to the

767
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,279
organization

768
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,840
and i'd really like to uh credit here

769
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,120
nathan clark who

770
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,960
was my sock manager up until recently

771
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,960
for enterprise customers

772
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,400
and uh he's got this methodology he uses

773
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:39,039
i call the richie charts and uh it's

774
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,720
really focused and i just wanted to

775
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,279
quickly

776
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,520
talk you through this as a as a way to

777
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,559
help your

778
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,039
same engineering crew look at what's the

779
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,559
best log sources so

780
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,000
what we're doing here is we're taking a

781
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,640
number of use cases that we've developed

782
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,480
for a particular customer to address

783
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,159
their risks we look through

784
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,000
what are the types of logs that we might

785
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,679
need to provision

786
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,520
into the same platform where are the

787
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,120
actual sources for those

788
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,440
and then what's available what's not

789
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,880
available and is it used in any

790
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,679
correlation

791
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,080
alerts there's a bit of scribble over

792
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,240
here that might be a bit hard to read

793
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,240
but then the really powerful thing is

794
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,520
looking at how

795
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,799
as a as a whole your scene platform uh

796
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,600
is performing and what log sources are

797
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,480
are critical

798
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,960
to driving those use cases which map

799
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,360
back to the organizational risk

800
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,120
um this is something we've we've

801
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,640
implemented in practice with

802
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,720
uh some of our customers we've found it

803
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,080
really valuable and

804
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,480
i'd recommend you to reach out to nathan

805
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,440
clark who

806
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,919
you may know and uh have a chat with him

807
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,880
if you want to find out more

808
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,760
next slide

809
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,200
yeah thank you prescott and that is

810
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,840
important right it goes back to

811
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,159
just because you have more devices

812
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,159
doesn't necessarily mean the volume logs

813
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,760
it just means you need to be smart about

814
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,480
how you go and which parts of it

815
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,080
the last thing here that we want to do

816
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,720
is you know and invest in your people

817
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,559
processes and technology you know

818
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,840
at the people level you need to continue

819
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,279
to it's like

820
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,080
you know the the care and feeding got to

821
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,600
give them interesting work

822
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,799
they have to be able to if you're not

823
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,080
eliminating the repeated work uh the

824
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,799
daily reports those types of things the

825
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,000
smart good people

826
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,320
are going to they're going to leave

827
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,679
because they are going to

828
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,120
they are in high demand and they're

829
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,120
going to want to go do interesting

830
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,840
things so you have to give them the

831
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,120
opportunities

832
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,120
um one of the things i think verizon

833
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,640
does very well and

834
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,720
part of being of a of a larger

835
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,919
corporation

836
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,799
is with our human resources and learning

837
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,200
and

838
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,399
development uh creating specific career

839
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,799
paths giving people lots of opportunity

840
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:55,679
to move

841
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,480
within verizon as a whole we have well

842
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:58,880
over

843
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,919
2500 security specialists

844
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:03,840
and what it is is there's different

845
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,840
teams so if you're on the managed

846
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,760
security side and you wanted to go work

847
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,799
at the corporate

848
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,720
cso you could do that or you could go to

849
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,320
the network where to ps

850
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,399
but it's creating those opportunities

851
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,399
those unique opportunities where people

852
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:17,600
can move around

853
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:20,960
and uh you know get greater exposure

854
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,919
keep interest move on to new projects

855
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:24,640
the other thing

856
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,960
it's it's it's about the processes and

857
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,240
this is the

858
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,440
unsexy stuff but this is the stuff that

859
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,760
really does matter this is for your

860
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,279
your iso 9000 your iso 27 000 your eye

861
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,520
wraps your hipaas your socks

862
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:42,640
and what we find and what we've done

863
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,600
is especially with our iso processes is

864
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,840
really identified this and embraced it

865
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,559
to

866
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:52,159
identify the risk from the grassroots

867
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,840
and then to to drive resolution of these

868
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,240
um by having the processes and having

869
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,919
them documented and doing in these

870
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,360
formats

871
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,080
it at first it's tedious but then you'll

872
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,399
find that it actually does reduce risk

873
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,080
it helps identify that then you get the

874
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,200
resources

875
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,520
the other one is if you don't have the

876
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,360
process and it's not standard you can't

877
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,360
automate because you can't do a playbook

878
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,200
if you don't know what you're doing

879
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,000
and then the final one is the is the

880
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,159
technology and it's the combination

881
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,600
of the people and the processes and

882
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,000
we are a huge advocate of soar we're

883
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,640
leveraging

884
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,399
soar across multiple teams we're doing

885
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:33,919
this can only help with the

886
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,320
ins um internet investigation but now

887
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,840
we're leveraging this on the device

888
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,799
management

889
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,240
we're not only doing on the security

890
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,760
side but on the network side where we

891
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,640
have 300

892
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,000
000 plus devices and 107 countries

893
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,720
but you tie that technology we're into

894
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,480
the processes of people

895
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,720
and then like i said earlier where you

896
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,520
have the

897
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,080
the change management the itil base to

898
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,000
do the playbooks

899
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,880
based on the processes people roll it

900
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,960
out and they'll use it and this is how

901
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,519
we feel that this is the best way to do

902
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:06,080
it

903
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,039
leverage the sword leverage the

904
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:10,320
technology but that can only be based on

905
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,279
the processes

906
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,799
and then you turn it over to smart

907
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:14,320
people and that's how you're going to

908
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,679
keep them engaged

909
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:17,200
that's got anything you wanted to add on

910
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,960
to that yeah

911
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,000
um bang on bruce um for me it always has

912
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,440
been the people the most important

913
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,360
and i know there's probably a few people

914
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,559
in the room here that

915
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,279
have worked with uh with us in the past

916
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,320
um

917
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,799
but uh yeah i think there's a lot to be

918
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:33,600
done around

919
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,919
you know psychology in how we manage

920
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:36,720
socks

921
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,360
looking at um behavior you know i think

922
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,399
one of those

923
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:42,559
things for for a soft manager is already

924
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:43,840
a leader in

925
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,080
you know in security operations is i

926
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,519
think you've bruce's sort of said before

927
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:48,320
it's getting

928
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,760
the right problem to the right person

929
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,120
engage their brain as quickly as

930
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,840
possible and then adding value to

931
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,840
to the organization into the to the

932
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,039
wider economy as well

933
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,679
absolutely

934
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,600
next slide please so

935
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,559
with that wanna thank all of you and

936
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,240
appreciate your time and attention

937
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,080
hopefully we gave you some

938
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,519
um key insights and some things to think

939
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,399
about

940
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:23,120
um once again appreciate your time

941
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,279
we are leveraging soar we're leveraging

942
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:28,159
process technology but at the end of it

943
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,080
i think you'll hear once again it's

944
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,360
really it is

945
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,440
the people that make the difference on

946
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,720
on all of this

947
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,679
and your job as a security leader is the

948
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,600
harness the best of the people

949
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,600
give them the tools and resources that

950
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,720
they need

951
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,240
help them kind of get in the right

952
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,559
direction and then stand back and you'll

953
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,320
be surprised at great things they'll do

954
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,360
so this i think we're ready to do uh q a

955
