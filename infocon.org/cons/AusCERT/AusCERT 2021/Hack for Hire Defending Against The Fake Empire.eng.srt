1
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,039
all right

2
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,399
welcome back for those that stayed

3
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,600
welcome for those that are new uh so the

4
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,000
next

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,960
speaker we have coming up is roger sells

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,840
i'm hoping pronouncing it all right

7
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,640
um and this one's a virtual speaker so

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,160
it's pre-recorded so unfortunately won't

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:46,879
be able to take

10
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,840
any questions i think time zones are not

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,879
really friendly

12
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,079
so this one's a hack for hire defending

13
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:54,879
against

14
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,559
the fake empire so

15
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,039
what do indian oil tycoons middle

16
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,559
eastern government officials

17
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,000
and qatari kashmiri chic

18
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,360
political groups all have in common

19
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,280
they are all targets of the behemoth

20
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,799
threat actor known

21
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,320
by the moniker bahumit bahamut

22
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,640
i hope i'm pronouncing that as rightly

23
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,520
as well

24
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,280
so defending against this specific

25
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,680
threat actor is especially difficult

26
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,880
because the group of suspected of

27
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,960
reusing the group's tools and imitating

28
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,439
their trade craft

29
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,200
so the threat actors also heavily

30
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,119
leverages public available tools that

31
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,759
further obscure attribution as well

32
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,520
so we've got roger cells is just about

33
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,880
to come up on the

34
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,799
on the screen there so roger leads

35
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:43,920
blackberry security

36
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,079
solutions for europe middle east and

37
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,040
africa

38
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,119
and serves as a trusted advisor to

39
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,360
clients c-suites with a focus on

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,799
maximizing their cyber

41
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,119
program value and impact he has more

42
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,399
than 20 years of

43
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,880
hands-on deep technical experience and

44
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,000
leadership

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,640
within the cyber security space before

46
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,399
joining blackberry silence

47
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,320
roger was a founding chief information

48
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,720
security officer at a fast-paced startup

49
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,520
where he acted as a trusted advisor and

50
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,160
a management consultant to executives in

51
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,080
several fortune 50 companies

52
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,959
over several years most recently with

53
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,239
blue chip

54
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,160
organizations including deutsche bank

55
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,040
axa technology services and ing

56
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,440
so can we please give a warm virtual

57
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,879
clap hopefully it goes over

58
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:37,840
to where he is welcome to roger

59
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,560
hi good morning everyone and thank you

60
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,280
for joining

61
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,560
my session regarding bahamut um

62
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,280
it would have been great to be there

63
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,640
physically with you

64
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,680
or or even life but

65
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,760
i hope you enjoy the presentation

66
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,920
regardless so today i have the honor of

67
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,120
presenting

68
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,440
the research that our team did

69
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,560
regarding this threat actor and i need

70
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,239
to first share some

71
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,120
historical context with you because

72
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,159
different

73
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,159
groups and organizations have actually

74
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,080
written about this threat actor and

75
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,200
through our research

76
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,239
we've been able to go back to previous

77
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,159
campaigns even ones that weren't

78
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,120
attributed

79
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,599
and link all of them together to this

80
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:30,959
one trend actor

81
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,400
so the beginning a few minutes might be

82
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,480
might seem a little confusing but this

83
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,760
all started back

84
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,519
in 2017 um so i'll guide you through

85
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,640
that

86
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,480
but um essentially i want to give you

87
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,000
that context and

88
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,280
show you how the targeting of the track

89
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,400
actor evolved

90
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,360
and and why this makes us believe that

91
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,239
um

92
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,720
this isn't a group that is offering

93
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,599
services

94
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,080
either to governments or crime groups

95
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,640
to perform different operational

96
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,439
campaigns

97
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,400
in different geographical regions and

98
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,200
then we'll look

99
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,400
at their exceptional trade craft across

100
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,000
a number of domains a quick

101
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,279
note on my background i have 20 years of

102
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:21,519
experience in cyber security

103
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,639
i come from penetration testing rack

104
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,479
theming

105
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,440
instant response um have degree in in

106
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,880
reverse engineering

107
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,400
uh do i uh i don't reverse engineer on

108
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,240
a day-to-day basis um and then the last

109
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,199
10 years

110
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,240
have come into organizations that had a

111
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,880
crisis of security leadership helped

112
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,080
restructure

113
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:49,120
the security programs

114
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,080
um and in my last role before joining

115
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,880
blackberry

116
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,080
i was the first ceso

117
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,360
at dark matter so i set up the

118
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,520
security teams there and what's

119
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,520
interesting is that

120
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,360
i'm in a way tied to bahamut in that

121
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,400
well one of the previous researchers

122
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,680
that wrote about muhammad in his

123
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,320
wind shift

124
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,720
campaign uh analysis was taha karim

125
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,759
who was working at

126
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,960
matter and then initially back in

127
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,240
2016 i had picked up on

128
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,880
certain attacks to a number of our

129
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,720
executives

130
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,479
and then later on when taha joined the

131
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,199
organization

132
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,360
i had flagged a number of things to him

133
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,120
which led the heart to

134
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,520
i think follow a number of bad threats

135
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,160
so um

136
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,199
i i definitely saw bahamut from the

137
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,520
siso seat and that was pretty impressive

138
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,039
now the thing i cover with a lot of

139
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,280
clients and have been discussing

140
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,840
is that we're seeing a lot of chaos in

141
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,039
the cyber realm

142
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,000
that is coming from an accelerated pace

143
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,240
of

144
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,319
change of technology adoption

145
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,639
interconnectivity

146
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,840
or hyper connectivity but also stems

147
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:12,240
from

148
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,960
geopolitical tensions more and more

149
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,160
states are

150
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,919
investing in offensive security

151
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,000
campaigns we also know that

152
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,639
the offensive investment by cyber crime

153
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:23,840
groups

154
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,600
has reduced the barrier to entry

155
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,160
because now you can get all of these

156
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,400
elements of a successful campaign

157
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,440
as a service even the initial access

158
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,960
the malware ransomware

159
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,880
tools to avoid detection and so on and

160
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,960
so forth what's interesting though

161
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,919
is that the geopolitical pension is

162
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,160
maybe never as emphasized

163
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,080
as um through the observing of the

164
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,720
campaign

165
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,240
of uh muhammad and bahamut

166
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,280
as an actor is very well resourced

167
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,639
has exhibited exceptional tradecraft

168
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,680
they've been extremely patient we've

169
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,319
observed cases where they were

170
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:08,960
performing

171
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,400
recon and and patiently waiting for an

172
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,840
opportunity to strike

173
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,360
for over a year they've developed a

174
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,479
methodology

175
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,840
that is um using fake

176
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,520
news fake applications um to even

177
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,960
profile the behavior

178
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,080
of their targets and then they load them

179
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,120
into social media

180
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,720
profiles that disseminate links to

181
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,759
phishing infrastructure or um

182
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,039
to malware websites

183
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,000
and they even had malicious apps but all

184
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,479
of them

185
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,919
expertly crafted and then a last thing

186
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:50,639
that is

187
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,800
pretty interesting is that they respond

188
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,120
to detection and analysis

189
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,400
both in real time as well as when a

190
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,599
report is published now regarding

191
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,280
the name and by way of introduction

192
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,560
let me read you the actual introduction

193
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,919
from the report bahamut is the name

194
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:12,400
given

195
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,199
to a gigantic sea monster that helps

196
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:15,919
hold up

197
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,800
the earth in a genesis story that is

198
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,319
arabic in origin

199
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,879
and the story of bahamut is included in

200
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:23,840
edward lane's

201
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,120
arabian society in the middle ages an

202
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,319
excerpt of lane's translation appears in

203
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,680

00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,799
borges book of imaginary beings and

205
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,880
borgs likens the bahamas to

206
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,479
biblical behemoth a creature so immense

207
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,719
that human eyes cannot bear to look at

208
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:43,519
it

209
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,959
um it's also the name given to a cyber

210
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,720
espionage track actor

211
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,279
by researchers writing for balance in

212
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,640
2017

213
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,680
and they chose that name and description

214
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,360
in you of any personally identifiable

215
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,240
information

216
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,040
or even descriptive identifiers within

217
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,240
the campaigns

218
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,200
and the researchers mentioned in the

219
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,240
same breath

220
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,440
that they um had a constant

221
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,080
struggle to attribute attacks to the

222
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,880
groups

223
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,440
and that's something that we can really

224
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,640
relate to

225
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,680
over the years organizations such as

226
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,959
amnesty international

227
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,000
kaspersky trend micro symmetria dark

228
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,640

229
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,240
eset forcepoint symantec palo alto

230
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,440
and so on and so forth um microsoft

231
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,480
cisco thomas and 12 support and gave a

232
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,279
different view

233
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,600
of muhammad even at some point

234
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,560
attributed

235
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,680
some campaigns to other actors

236
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,760
but we have been reviewing this

237
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,279
extensively and have found

238
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,320
sufficient evidence that ties all of

239
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:54,800
these

240
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,240
together to the same trend actor

241
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,360
now in terms of where they operated

242
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,079
they had two zones they were mainly

243
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,680
active in or focused on

244
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,800
which were south south asia

245
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,600
and the gulf and then they had more

246
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,839
opportunistic and different campaigns

247
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,200
across north and eastern europe africa

248
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,720
a little bit in in china um

249
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,200
that's actually not well indicated but

250
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,480
um

251
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,519
it changed over time and

252
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,120
historically and initially in 2017 and

253
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,800
and so on

254
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,720
they were mostly focused on political

255
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,920
campaigns more targeting individuals

256
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,839
especially diplomats

257
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,399
and i think organizations involved with

258
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,440
the united nations um

259
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,480
foreign affairs ministries um

260
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,519
they were always avoiding targets in

261
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,200
the united states and they were focused

262
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,600
on

263
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,839
south asia specifically india and

264
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,360
pakistan

265
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,000
with then as i said a number of

266
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,040
campaigns in

267
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,680
either china or northern and eastern

268
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,040
europe

269
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,920
and then later on they started adding

270
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,839
campaigns where they really went after

271
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,360
government agencies

272
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,760
private organizations as well we've seen

273
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,560
them fish

274
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,320
users that are using very

275
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,040
well reputed and known and widely used

276
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,079
messaging services both in the west and

277
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:34,800
the east

278
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,640
um so that is also something

279
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:41,600
that is indicative of a wide target

280
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,000
space or different target bases

281
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,800
and then they added a particular focus

282
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,680
to the gulf

283
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,959
nations as well as to

284
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:55,519
south asia across these targets

285
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,560
i think in saudi arabia they

286
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,000
targeted seven different ministries

287
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,399
and the emphasis there was monetary and

288
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,480
financial policy

289
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,959
in the uae qatar bahrain kuwait

290
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,079
the focus was on retrieving information

291
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,239
on foreign policy and defense

292
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,920
they also went after a diplomat in the

293
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:25,279
emirati ministry of foreign affairs the

294
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,839
emirati minister minister of state for

295
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,360
foreign affairs

296
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,760
himself the head of an emirati foreign

297
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,680
policy think tank

298
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,480
and so on and so forth so because of

299
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,279
this

300
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,120
wide array of different targets regions

301
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,320
it's very difficult to to

302
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,600
to find which nation-state

303
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,839
or crime group could be really

304
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:50,959
interested

305
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,320
in in these campaigns and then of course

306
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,160
because these are espionage campaigns

307
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,440
that would lead us to

308
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,880
conclude that um it had to be

309
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,519
a nation-state or is more likely a

310
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:04,480
nation-state

311
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,519
that conducted these

312
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,320
so how did they operate well initially

313
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,959
they would do one of three things

314
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,160
and social media were quite genius they

315
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,600
would reach out to targets directly

316
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,160
through a private message typically from

317
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,839
an attractive

318
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,440
woman profile or they would ensure

319
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,639
that their victims would um see

320
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,839
news that was specifically targeted at

321
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:34,639
hashtags

322
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,760
that they would um would consume or or

323
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,279
pick up

324
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,600
and then they would also gradually

325
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:48,399
distort news on on certain websites

326
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,519
or publish uh unique content

327
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,000
so that people would interact with that

328
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,800
try and

329
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,240
find out more and then land into

330
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,560
one of the social media profiles

331
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,279
that were set up to disseminate the same

332
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,279
use

333
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,399
all of these initial vectors lacked

334
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,680
anything malicious and it was

335
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,320
always expertly tailored to the interest

336
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,360
of the targeted

337
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,399
individual or organization so balanced

338
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,600
had found times of arab.com which

339
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,399
copied news from real websites

340
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,279
eventually

341
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,160
they took over apparently a website

342
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,600
called

343
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,760
factsprouts.com uh which created

344
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,399
unique content so techsprouts was a

345
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,440
website

346
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,560
that uh seemingly looked legitimate

347
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,160
um and and initially started by just

348
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,920
showing people news about technology

349
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,560
mobile phone reviews and those things

350
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,279
and

351
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,560
we even found

352
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,199
a c-cert ireland

353
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,399
advisory tlp white that referred

354
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,920
to some news on tech sprouts

355
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,959
so it looked widely picked up in a lot

356
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,720
of communities

357
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,440
and we started investigating tech

358
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,240
sprouts

359
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,199
uh more attentively and watching it for

360
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,120
a longer period of time

361
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,920
at some point we were fortunate that the

362
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,120
privacy services

363
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,560
for the domain registration um had

364
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,600
elapsed and that showed us a email

365
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,920
address

366
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,519
agarwal.1988 hotmail.com

367
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,000
and eventually we're able to link this

368
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,199
email address

369
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:42,240
to a facebook profile and

370
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,560
the last post was on july

371
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,560
17 of 2019 and

372
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,279
initially it appeared that mr agarwal

373
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:53,600
was

374
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,199
just a freelance technology journalist

375
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,839
a mobile phone reviewer in india but

376
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:00,880
then

377
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,320
as we started seeing the website

378
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,519
tech sprouts change we found this is

379
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,959
newton's um facebook profile by the way

380
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:13,600
we found that nitin was contributing on

381
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,160
a wide variety of articles and

382
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,399
actually in fact helping steer tech

383
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,000
sprouts in a different

384
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,160
direction so you see some articles about

385
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,519
the nso group

386
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,360
about breaches and security and trump

387
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,680
and all of these that would appeal to

388
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,360
certain

389
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,800
people now uh definitely

390
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,240
we knew something was up with tech

391
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,959
sprouts but we found nothing malicious

392
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,839
so looking at all of the sub-domains we

393
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,399
found that

394
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:45,839
mail.taxproducts.com um through

395
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,880
passive dns history had seemed to

396
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,639
resolve

397
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,519
to a number of hosts with an identical

398
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,880
configuration

399
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,880
from a network services and ports

400
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,440
perspective and that allowed us to

401
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,040
generate a unique

402
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,160
network service fingerprint that um

403
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,720
when we occurred through showdown if we

404
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,919
found a match

405
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,119
uh for this particular configuration

406
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:16,799
of services uh on a host

407
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,919
um we could uh to a high degree

408
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,599
of assurance link it to bahamut and

409
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,720
this table shows you a number of these

410
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,840
so we have ranging from

411
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,520
websites that we don't know what they

412
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,760
did like bulletinalerts.com

413
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,160
just copied headlines from the south

414
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,760
china morning post

415
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,160
uh we have a website in there that's

416
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,679
identical in content

417
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,440
to zero we have a fake fitness site that

418
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,120
was distributing

419
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,880
malware and communicating to windows

420
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,320
malware and implants we had

421
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,440
a number of websites relating to

422
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,640
kalistam

423
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,679
and sixth for justice so again a wide

424
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:02,400
variety

425
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,280
of content to choose from and um well

426
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:05,919
let's start

427
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,799
by the sixth for justice so it's a

428
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,280
session

429
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,720
essentially a secessionist movement um

430
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,000
and it's the brainchild of

431
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,360
um a person called gurpatwand

432
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,720
singh palu who is residing in the us

433
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,440
they're a group of individuals outside

434
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,160
of india

435
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,559
who support the secession of the sikh

436
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,200
territory

437
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,480
in the northern state of punjab

438
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,720
the intent is to recreate the

439
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,679
original sick held land that predates

440
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:40,559
the partition

441
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:44,480
of india and pakistan in the 40s

442
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,720
and the territory is referred to as

443
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,919
kalista

444
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:53,039
and it crosses the modern day border

445
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,400
into part of pakistan where the sikh

446
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,520
guru

447
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,720
who founded the religion is from so

448
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,799
this movement has been trying to

449
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,880
organize a

450
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,240
referendum in 2020

451
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,440
to to call for that session and in the

452
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,080
lead-up

453
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:16,720
to this uh released a voter application

454
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,160
now um the uh

455
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,960
founder refers to himself as a human

456
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:23,760
rights

457
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,200
advocate and the indian government

458
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,000
views him slightly differently as a

459
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,400
individual terrorist

460
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,600
and the government even

461
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,320
successfully petitioned google to remove

462
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:38,720
it

463
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,440
from the app from the google play store

464
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,039
in 2019.

465
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,200
so we found as you saw in the list

466
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,880
several domains that were used by

467
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,919
bahamath

468
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,400
to engage with sfj sympathizers um

469
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,440
and also interesting to call out that

470
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,919
from the indian government perspective

471
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,919
um people have even speculated

472
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,200
that the sfj movement is secretly

473
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,039
propped up by the pakistani

474
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:07,520
military and intelligence services to

475
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,799
destabilize

476
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,000
the region so plenty of

477
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:16,240
geopolitical tension right there

478
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,960
when we looked at two of the domains we

479
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,520
found

480
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,640
an ip tracker um

481
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,080
element there and a script that we

482
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,120
when playing around with it were able to

483
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,480
make it spit out an error message that

484
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,760
revealed a path including names

485
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,280
of two lithuanian gods

486
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,039
if i butchered the language it would be

487
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,440
nona divis and vargantes

488
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,080
and they were hosted on different ip

489
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,640
dresses

490
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,679
in lithuania and this is where we found

491
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,120
a first malicious apk um

492
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,240
i'll come to that later and we also

493
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:56,880
found

494
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,320
a social media profile of how targets

495
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,600
were being lured into um all this

496
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,559
distorted

497
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,919
uh world and then into downloading

498
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,559
this app so you see that they were

499
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,520
targeting

500
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,840
uh kalistan en 2020

501
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,840
referendum 2020 six for justice

502
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,960
hashtags and so on and so forth

503
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,280
um and then indicated how to download

504
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,320
the app

505
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,360
and the app would have looked uh pretty

506
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,880
uh benign to the sympathizers

507
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,240
so that's just one element of luring

508
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,520
targets into their web then we have

509
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,280
again a whole list here

510
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,039
um just quickly want to touch on

511
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,320
bulletin alerts

512
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,760
because that website um had a very um

513
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,320
interesting about us section that led us

514
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,200
to bulletin

515
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,559
news.com bulletin news.com itself

516
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,400
didn't have any privacy registration

517
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,080
which might have been intentional

518
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,679
because that then pushed you

519
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,360
into the twitter profile of zilling one

520
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,080
a selfie addict who loves music is

521
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,039
single

522
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,520
uh doesn't tweet that much when she

523
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,400
tweets

524
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,720
tweets out um shortened urls

525
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,600
who doesn't love that right um so this

526
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,000
first one that we see here

527
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,280
in october 2019 actually refers to

528
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,200
a the main e-verification

529
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,679
sessionloads.com

530
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,799
uh we were able to determine um a number

531
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,720
of other domains that resolved to the

532
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,520
iep

533
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,559
and to conclude that this part of their

534
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:37,520
campaigns

535
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,960
was only used to fish cena

536
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:46,000
and yahoo users based in china

537
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,039
and at this point i think it's

538
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:49,760
worthwhile

539
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,039
to just continue the analysis

540
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,600
by looking at these apps so we saw

541
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,159
through the

542
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,360
sfj fake

543
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,600
social media apps that we were able to

544
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,799
find

545
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,080
these websites we were offered a fake

546
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,679
or malicious application now

547
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,919
in terms of these applications they were

548
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,200
extremely well designed

549
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,520
and they had fully functional websites

550
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,120
legitimate urlas

551
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,159
the disclaimers for privacy

552
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,720
uh in terms of conditions were extremely

553
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,919
well written

554
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,520
nothing would tip you off that these

555
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,280
applications weren't in fact

556
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,240
actual uh applications and and they had

557
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:30,480
a

558
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,520
va right wide range of

559
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,400
functionalities ranging from a ramadan

560
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:36,880
prayer

561
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,120
timer to um a call recorder

562
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,559
media players voiceover ip applications

563
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,120
password saver app we'll look at that in

564
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,080
detail

565
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,600
um and we uh eventually were able to

566
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,679
determine that these applications

567
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,080
uh had backdoor capabilities to

568
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,679
enumerate files

569
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,799
access contacts uh track people uh

570
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,240
with gps and upload files to remote

571
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,440
server

572
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,360
so we we also found some of these

573
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,720
applications by looking

574
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,480
at other research so trend micros

575
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,360
or page research in particular let us do

576
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,679
some

577
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,799
android apps and through um

578
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,840
uh mercer ruskaners and williams

579
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,799
uh cisco talos blog posts were able to

580
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:25,520
actually

581
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,799
find a number of ios applications

582
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,960
i think they indicated in site-loaded

583
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,720
applications but we were able to find

584
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,600
some

585
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,240
that were active on the on the store on

586
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,760
the app store

587
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,880
um interestingly enough these apps

588
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,760
bypassed static code security safeguards

589
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,200
here you see one of these

590
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,480
websites very clean looking very

591
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,960
normal for what you'd expect for a video

592
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,640
player to have and showcase you see here

593
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,679
terms of services privacy policy and all

594
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:00,559
of these

595
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,840
are real or look real now

596
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,640
we found some that were still live as we

597
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,640
were compiling the report

598
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,960
the ramadan player app seemed to be

599
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,720
launched in

600
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,520
saudi arabia and to be region locked to

601
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,720
saudi arabia

602
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,000
and the uae uh the call recorder uh

603
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,400
and actually the other uh five apps uh

604
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,600
that we found

605
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,400
um that were live sorry the other four

606
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,720
of the five that were live and had about

607
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,679
a thousand

608
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,159
plus installations at the time that we

609
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,279
observed them

610
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,840
um but we couldn't figure out which

611
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:36,480
regions

612
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,600
they specifically uh were for because

613
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,720
these were more broad in nature and

614
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,760
could have

615
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,919
attracted a more diverse target set

616
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,960
we also even found outside of the play

617
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,919
store by

618
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,120
again referring to our unique network

619
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,080
service fingerprint a number of websites

620
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,760
distributing

621
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,360
apks a very interesting one was

622
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,720
this one that had a toys for islam

623
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,360
social media profile uh that was

624
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,440
specifically targeting

625
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:17,039
um weapons enthusiasts and i guess

626
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,320
if you were to fish or target uh

627
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,200
military personnel uh intelligence

628
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,799
agency personnel

629
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,159
um law enforcement in general uh yeah

630
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,799
you might find that some people um will

631
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,400
be open to installing such an

632
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,640
application

633
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,440
so um in terms of ios applications

634
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,840
they made an upset mistake again with

635
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,120
that unique server

636
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,279
service fingerprint which led us to

637
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,039
uncover a number of websites

638
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,080
that were involved in serving

639
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:53,120
also up links and then uh

640
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,640
helped us find uh some of the apps that

641
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,520
were live

642
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,360
on the on the app store and some are

643
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,960
linked there um

644
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,600
interestingly enough in terms of ios

645
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,039
there were no political overtones

646
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,159
the message the messaging and targeting

647
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,200
seemed more broad with the exception of

648
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,240
a ramadan prayer application

649
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,600
or voice over ip applications that were

650
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,200
very specifically targeted to bypass

651
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,960
restrictions in countries like

652
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,120
the uee but what stood out even more

653
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,840
is that there was a file manager and a

654
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,960
password

655
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,320
saving application that were also

656
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,240
offered and i want to just

657
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,640
highlight these well-designed websites

658
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:43,679
again

659
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,799
here you see yet another application

660
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,000
why wasn't this discovered well because

661
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,520
the websites were well made

662
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:54,880
um and because um the uh

663
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:58,159
apps worked as advertised so um that

664
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:01,200
that really helped i think also

665
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,960
there have been a number of hurdles for

666
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,240
researchers to

667
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,760
identify um and analyze the applications

668
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,720
and not just just malware so it's been

669
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,880
historically more difficult to perform

670
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,279
this

671
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,559
on ios that's just

672
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,760
an ecosystem thing and apple has

673
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:23,039
started to address some issues from the

674
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,320
user perspective

675
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,080
by flagging abnormal behavior

676
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,240
we've all seen these these updates or by

677
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,919
indicating where privacy

678
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,320
is harmed uh which permissions you're

679
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,080
actually giving an application so i

680
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:36,640
think

681
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,840
these are good uh evolutions to help at

682
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,679
least the security community

683
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:44,320
gain a better understanding of some

684
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,159
things that were happening

685
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,840
but even even then if you look at the

686
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,799
password saver application so it saved

687
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,640
passwords and allowed to auto complete

688
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,480
them on a number of websites that i've

689
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:56,960
listed

690
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,919
on the right on the slides there was

691
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,840
nothing apparently malicious

692
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,720
in terms of functionality at a casual

693
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,360
look

694
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,559
in the app um the app resided in the

695
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,520
root of the

696
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,559
ipa package um

697
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,200
strings were being uh encrypted and

698
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,399
stored

699
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,120
encryption was using aes in cdc mode

700
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,600
with a 256 bit key

701
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,080
and it's only when we started to look at

702
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:24,799
the

703
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,120
encryption and decryption routines that

704
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,840
we find

705
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,360
a function called generate random iv 16

706
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,360
which actually never returns a random iv

707
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,559
but always returns a fixed string

708
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,440
which ultimately leads to the encryption

709
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,520
being completely reversible

710
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,559
um so that's uh one

711
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,919
uh issue also um to do the encryption

712
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,000
uh the final encryption decryption they

713
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,279
were using uh

714
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,679
benign system libraries so here they

715
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:56,559
call encryptor

716
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,080
library and the rest of the application

717
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,200
really consisted of standard libraries

718
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,480
except for a custom method to derive

719
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,600
the aes key to

720
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,159
during the decryption process from an

721
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,440
md5 hash

722
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,559
of a particular string and the app

723
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,600
worked as advertised you were

724
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,559
effectively

725
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,919
storing your passwords and encrypted

726
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,960
in the app just again the passwords were

727
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,080
reversible

728
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,960
and um well euphemistically we could say

729
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,039
your passwords were also being backed up

730
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,080
to the cloud

731
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,480
at the website passwordsaverwr.com

732
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,000
which was under muhammad's control and

733
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,279
the funny thing is users have been told

734
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,120
sorry

735
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,000
users have been told and and were warned

736
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,679
that this was going to happen

737
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,039
and remember i said the ulas and privacy

738
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,559
policies looked legit

739
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,440
well privacy policy here standard

740
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,399
legalese

741
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:06,960
but in terms of in alternatives and

742
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:07,760
conditions

743
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,559
it said that if you use the application

744
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:10,960
the

745
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,519
app will take information regarding your

746
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,399
device

747
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,360
to ensure compatibility um with the

748
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,320
application

749
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:20,399
that doesn't sound too bad right when

750
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:21,360
you continue

751
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,840
it says the application shall have

752
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,720
access

753
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,600
to collect all your passwords your

754
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,480
documents

755
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,960
etc and other files stored in your local

756
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,720
storage

757
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,640
and people said yeah that's entirely

758
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,399
reasonable functionality

759
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:40,720
for a password saving application i'll

760
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:43,760
go ahead and click yes

761
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:47,840
so obviously i mean you don't need to

762
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,760
hack your victims if they're just giving

763
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,600
you their passwords

764
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,919
and then just giving you the rights to

765
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:55,279
just

766
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,559
siphon all of the data from their device

767
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,840
um if we look at how they were detecting

768
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,559
uh well avoiding detection and how these

769
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,360
back doors

770
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,519
then worked because we also found back

771
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:08,480
doors

772
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,390
um they

773
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,919
[Music]

774
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,679
interestingly enough were not

775
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,679
well made sure not to

776
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,240
be detectable and looked at malware

777
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,360
repositories

778
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,840
to see that okay their techniques used

779
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,880
were still

780
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,480
uh not being picked up on as as we said

781
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,720
for the ios but it's applicable for

782
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,240
android as well

783
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,480
main parts of the application were

784
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,240
completely legitimate

785
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:43,760
and they used either android or ios

786
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,279
benign libraries to cloud the underlying

787
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,240
activity

788
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:52,399
especially from static detection um

789
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:56,399
they used very normal ways of

790
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,480
encrypting uh the the network traffic

791
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,880
uh in this case yes in cvc mode

792
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,360
they stored the as encrypted

793
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,760
or encoded hex encoded strings

794
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:19,039
in normal parts of the application

795
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,840
sometimes also in the resource section

796
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,799
what

797
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:26,159
happened is that um keys were sometimes

798
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,399
stored in an icon so that

799
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:33,279
was was quite interesting or derived

800
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,399
from

801
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:37,760
strings in an icon

802
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,720
and eventually we found that there were

803
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,360
three

804
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,640
common keys that were being used

805
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,000
on these externally hosted apps which

806
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,240
were able to um to to to retrieve

807
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,279
and then also uh determined that yes

808
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,000
these apps were made by the same groups

809
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:58,720
because

810
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,559
when they published them even the

811
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,320
publisher of the apps

812
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,679
were unaffiliated and looked like they

813
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:06,000
were

814
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,040
distinct um from each other

815
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,119
uh maybe i should highlight the

816
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,199
construct network callbacks

817
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,639
by appending the destination to

818
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:20,320
a base url

819
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:23,440
in terms of functionality the app

820
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,879
actually allowed the c2

821
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,000
servers to instruct

822
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,480
it to load additional functionality

823
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,520
later on

824
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:36,480
by loading additional uh dex files in

825
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:36,960
the case

826
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,079
of um of android um

827
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,199
the the the the keys were static

828
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,599
for decryption and as i said sometimes

829
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:46,800
hidden within the

830
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,320
icon file which would maybe not be

831
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
picked up by analysis

832
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,760
um in terms of backdoor functionalities

833
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,960
very interesting looking for specific

834
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,160
file types that could be uploaded

835
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,079
then the normal functionality you'd

836
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,359
expect expect

837
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:08,079
on these platforms um accessing the

838
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,920
contacts call records

839
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,040
audio video but then also

840
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,560
tracking the gps location which is

841
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,920
somewhat more ominous and then

842
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,960
in terms of their operational security

843
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,119
as well as these phishing campaigns what

844
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,079
was very

845
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,200
interesting there is that all phases of

846
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,560
the attack

847
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,400
be it from fishing credential harvesting

848
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,720
distributing malware and communicating

849
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,440
with

850
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,280
the implants um are our sufferings

851
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,079
the infrastructure to operate the

852
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,599
malware

853
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:49,359
for windows android ios

854
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:52,560
they were all separate so there was no

855
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,720
ip crossover they used over 50 different

856
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,119
hosting providers and that's also

857
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,480
because i think in the past

858
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,040
they had noticed that researchers

859
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,960
including balance and others

860
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,359
had actually seen that okay we found

861
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,040
domains registered with

862
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:11,680
specific email addresses or it's always

863
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,440
uh ending on the main star that are

864
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,160
mail.org

865
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,320
or they are always hosting in country x

866
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,760
or wine so

867
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,359
based on how they have been

868
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,200
discovered and how various aspects of

869
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,359
their campaigns have been tied together

870
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:31,440
they adapted and interestingly enough

871
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,240
this was after the fact but we had a

872
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:34,960
number of

873
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,720
cases that we saw where they were even

874
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,280
trying to ascertain if somebody was

875
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,480
actively

876
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,720
looking at them by luring people into

877
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,400
what seemed to be some kind of decoy

878
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,000
websites that if that was hit

879
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,240
they knew that a part of that campaign

880
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,359
had been blown

881
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:55,680
and they would need to burn the

882
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,400
infrastructure

883
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,880
and start all over again that

884
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,920
infrastructure

885
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,800
was sometimes very short-lived um so it

886
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,520
appeared

887
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,560
on a weekly basis that they were adding

888
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,760
new infrastructure it

889
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,000
sometimes was only used for a specific

890
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,040
campaign or

891
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,400
one specific target and then never used

892
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,240
again

893
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,119
some of the operations more in a general

894
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:23,359
nature or of a general nature

895
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:26,480
than for years and others were only

896
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,200
observable

897
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,400
for a few hours and we got really lucky

898
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,880
a couple of times that that we were able

899
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,440
to

900
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,720
to pick these up the credential

901
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,760
harvesting

902
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:41,760
was across the map all of the

903
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,880
traditionally used

904
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,040
email services and messaging

905
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,240
applications

906
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:52,720
in the west as well as in the east

907
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,880
and um interesting to call outs that

908
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,920
they went after

909
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,160
the personal email addresses of their

910
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,040
targets

911
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,359
more than after their corporate email

912
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:02,640
addresses

913
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,359
and then they stole passwords from there

914
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,760
trying to gain access to systems

915
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:11,040
and uh and so on and so forth

916
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,680
um there are some phishing examples that

917
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:14,640
are still live

918
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,880
then you can find that the websites were

919
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,240
really well made

920
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,280
and they in their fishing used

921
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,400
a lot of uh url shorter shorteners

922
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,440
they even made one of them of themselves

923
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,040
and we saw that foremost they

924
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,440
used one that redirected um into a url

925
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,079
that would do some device fingerprinting

926
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:39,200
geolocation

927
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,480
type of device and then from there would

928
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,280
redirect

929
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:46,320
onto a freedom host domain

930
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,960
uh this is something that uh taha karim

931
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,599
um

932
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,160
alluded to in his windshield research um

933
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,160
and then they would actually lead to

934
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:58,240
an attacker-controlled domain to

935
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,560
make you download an application or

936
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,839
actually exploit

937
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,440
zero day vulnerabilities so it was a

938
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,640
multi-stage

939
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,480
attack we found a number of these

940
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:13,119
websites and their targets what's

941
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:13,760
interesting is

942
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,320
if you went directly to the base url or

943
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,760
to the ip address

944
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,320
you would probably land at a google or

945
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,920
apple error message

946
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,640
and probably think that um yeah nothing

947
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,400
was going on there

948
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,920
and it didn't merit further analysis

949
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,760
so they they had planned that quite well

950
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,560
now in terms of the malware that they

951
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,599
utilize

952
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,960
uh when you look at windows samples uh

953
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,119
they used an interesting string encoding

954
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,240
method

955
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,440
that uses um advanced

956
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,839
floating point calculations and they are

957
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,680
performed on x87

958
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:55,440
math coprocessors we're going to

959
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,280
almost run out of time so i'll i'll let

960
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,480
you read

961
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,359
up on this part in the report but uh

962
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:02,160
because of that

963
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:06,319
encoding we were again able to um

964
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:10,319
uh actually tie campaigns to them

965
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:12,079
another aspect that's interesting to

966
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,240
know of is that a lot of their

967
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:16,800
tools were programmed in vb6 and

968
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,160
compiled natively

969
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,800
which is more time consuming to reverse

970
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,920
they were checking

971
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,400
for forensic and malware analysis tools

972
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,680
on the client

973
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:29,599
hex editors hw works ida only dbg

974
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,720
wind dvg wireshark and so on and so

975
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,520
forth

976
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,760
to avoid detection so then

977
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,440
in terms of practical conclusions

978
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,160
all of the iocs are in the report i

979
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,040
think it's the last

980
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,800
10 10 or 15 pages but i think it

981
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:51,440
merits as an industry that we really

982
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,400
start thinking

983
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,800
about the state of mobile security

984
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,599
because we

985
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,280
we have clear gaps there that

986
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,720
adversaries haven't

987
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:02,240
been abusing so i think

988
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,000
using an um epp that's

989
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,119
not purely signature based um on

990
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,480
a mobile platform uh is key

991
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,240
and then having edr or even xdr

992
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,440
uh covering your mobiles

993
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,800
that attacks can be seen

994
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,920
can be correlated with other telemetry

995
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,800
from network

996
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:30,000
is is quite key of course

997
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,200
ingesting trapped intelligence as it

998
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,560
gets disseminated

999
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,440
um is also key but then i think on that

1000
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:37,920
note

1001
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:41,440
the wider challenge is we've seen that

1002
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,800
more than uh 12 13 different security

1003
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,359
groups

1004
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,760
have actually observed parts of their

1005
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,040
campaigns

1006
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,480
silence in the past also released a

1007
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,359
report on

1008
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,839
the white company that actually was

1009
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,760
bahamut

1010
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,400
so even security researchers at these

1011
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,680
firms

1012
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,880
didn't have a full visibility so i think

1013
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,720
it illustrates that for enterprises

1014
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,359
building these capabilities in-house is

1015
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:12,000
going to be

1016
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,480
extremely time-consuming extremely

1017
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,440
difficult

1018
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,319
um so my recommendation there would be

1019
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:18,960
partner

1020
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,079
with a firm that has this expertise and

1021
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,680
and has real world proven experience

1022
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,079
in in tracking these um these groups

1023
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:32,880
and then of course it emphasizes again

1024
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,520
the need

1025
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,280
for a zero trust model

1026
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:40,640
my goal here was just to give you all

1027
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,400
an overview of how vast

1028
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,240
the campaigns of mohammed were that

1029
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,440
yes we have proof and evidence that

1030
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:54,480
um for hire companies

1031
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,880
that are very professional in nature and

1032
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,200
have many diverse clients

1033
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,079
operating or requesting them to operate

1034
