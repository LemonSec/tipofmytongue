today um just a quick few quick

13
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,760
reminders just to use the app

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,440
the next couple of speakers are coming

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,120
in from a virtual sense

16
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,960
so if you can use the app to ask

17
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,800
questions i will get them and i can ask

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,559
for the microphone and the speaker will

19
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,120
actually hear them

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,439
cool so next up we have john grimm

32
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:35,760
that's quite loud

33
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,840

uh yeah so in this role

35
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,280
let me let me speak louder then in this

36
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,200
role he focuses on all aspects of cyber

37
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,479
security incidents

38
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,320

41
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,119
eradication efforts

42
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,040
and creating data breach response

43
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,240
preparedness training

44
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,079
and breach simulation exercises for

45
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,479
customers worldwide

46
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,280
i might well before i actually after i

47
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,640
push through to john i might run next

48
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,079
door and tell him to shut it keep it

49
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,000
down over there

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,959
all right so he's going to be talking

51
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,800
about out of the shadows into the

52
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,480
digital crosshairs

53
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,319
so john it's quite i don't know if you

54
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,080
can hear but it's quite loud in this

55
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,280
room i'm about to duck next door and

56
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:17,920
tell them

57
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,720
to be quiet but for the first little bit

58
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,000
if you can just speak up a little

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,920
bit it'll be really good it's quite loud

60
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,200
in here

61
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,120
so can we give a warm welcome for john

62
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,239

63
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,920
there we go can we give a warm welcome

64
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,559
for john thanks

65
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,840
thank you very much can you hear me

66
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,239
can you hear me okay folks good morning

67
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,080
this is john grim here with the verizon

68
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,920
threat research advisory center so i'm

69
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,920
very very happy to be here

70
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,200
participating in a us cert this year i'm

71
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,319
calling in from

72
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,080
pittsburgh pennsylvania over here in the

73
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,640
states uh it's night time my time

74
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,280
uh so hopefully uh as the sun starts to

75
00:02:59,280 --> 00:02:59,680
fall

76
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,640
you'll still see me uh bright and glowy

77
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,159
so let's without further ado

78
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,959
let's go ahead and start looking at the

79
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,040
cyber espionage report

80
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,400
so for me i do research development

81
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,360
and innovation for the vtrak team many

82
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,440
many years of investigations from the

83
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,640
government standpoint

84
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,040
and from the corporate standpoint and

85
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,840
one of the more

86
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,840
challenging type of investigations that

87
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,599
i've seen over the years

88
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,680
in both realms government and corporate

89
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,560
is the espionage investigations

90
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,840
but what are cyber espionage breaches

91
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,440
okay so this is the ground rules here

92
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,040
for today's discussion

93
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,680
so it's a very specific definition that

94
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,959
we use

95
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,840
for cyber espionage so first and

96
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,280
foremost for today

97
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,519
we're talking about data breaches where

98
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,640
there's a confirmed

99
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,040
compromise of data we're not talking

100
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,640
about cyber security and since we're

101
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,720
talking about the most successful threat

102
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,599
actors

103
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,360
and what they've been able to do in

104
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,439
terms of breaching the environments

105
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,480
exfiltrate data now

106
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,920
this data that we're going to be talking

107
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,439
about today is from the data breach

108
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,040
investigations report

109
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,200
which is our annual report that we

110
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,159
literally just

111
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:13,280
released its 14th edition today and so

112
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,319
this is a study

113
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,399
into data breaches so i'm going to be

114
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,839
using data from

115
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,918
the dvir and looking at seven years

116
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,279
worth of data

117
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,759
so the dbir itself defines cyber

118
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,479
espionage as an espionage motive

119
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,880
conducted by external threat actors who

120
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,240
are talking about external to the

121
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,440
organization

122
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,759
who are enabled via unauthorized network

123
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,360
or system access

124
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,520
and this is largely done by nation state

125
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,960
or state affiliated threat actors

126
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,680
looking for

127
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,160
specific types of data such as sensitive

128
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,280
information

129
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,160
trade secrets of proprietary information

130
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,160
so you can imagine these threat actors

131
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,400
pose a unique challenge

132
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,040
they use advanced trade craft and they

133
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,560
have a specific focus

134
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,479
in terms of what they're doing they can

135
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,040
move swiftly to gain access

136
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,600
and they can enter into heavily defended

137
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,400
environments

138
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,160
and they don't necessarily leave right

139
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,639
away they may stay and dwell

140
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,080
move laterally through the network

141
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,919
waiting for the next set of testings

142
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,039
before

143
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,880
they fulfill their obligations so i'll

144
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,639
talk about the dwell time as well

145
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,960
and what the data really says to us so

146
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,560
in terms of the data itself we're

147
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,600
looking at

148
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,240
the espionage motive okay with threat

149
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,120
actors from an external location

150
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,039
the pattern that we're looking at is the

151
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,960
cyber espionage breaches which is a

152
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,960
pattern that we've covered in the dbir

153
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,240
since 2014. we'll look

154
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,160
in the data set we do cover three

155
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,919
regions in the report today i won't be

156
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,600
covering the three regions but we do

157
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,199
have information for

158
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,639
80 pack abia as well as the americas

159
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,720
uh we do cover seven industries in the

160
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,800
report the seven industries that are

161
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,840
most impacted by cyber espionage threat

162
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,280
actors today i'll be focusing on the

163
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,600
seven years worth of data and roughly or

164
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,800
actually specifically 1580 breaches

165
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,120
so a couple other things i want to talk

166
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,080
about real quick

167
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,160
to for compass points and in direction

168
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,000
in terms of the discussion

169
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,240
so we're going to use a framework that's

170
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,919
known as the varus framework you can see

171
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,600
vocabulary for event recording and

172
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,160
incident

173
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,960
sharing is the framework that was

174
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,600
designed

175
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,400
several years ago to help facilitate the

176
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,360
collection of

177
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,319
incident and data breach data for

178
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,120
analysis

179
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,120
and for sharing you can also use it for

180
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,440
metrics and threat hunting cyber threat

181
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,639
modeling

182
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,800
risk management etc so today we're going

183
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,240
to be looking at

184
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,280
the data using the varus framework and

185
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,960
we're going to be specifically looking

186
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,960
at the a4 threat model which is a

187
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,240
sub-component

188
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,880
of varus it's the actors the actions the

189
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,479
assets and the attributes to help

190
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,520
understand

191
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,680
what we're seeing with cyber wrestling

192
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,759
threat actors if you're interested

193
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,120
in learning more about the various

194
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,800
framework you can see the link there on

195
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,520
the bottom left of your screen

196
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,759
variouscommunity.net as well as

197
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,080
github.com

198
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,520
and i'll provide these links at the end

199
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,840
of the presentation as well

200
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,240
so one other standard we're going to use

201
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,840
today for the discussion or at least to

202
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,280
highlight some of the controls and

203
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,960
countermeasures that come into play with

204
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,800
cyber espionage right actors

205
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,400
is the center for internet security

206
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,919
critical security controls there are

207
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:16,400
actually

208
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,680
20 of them that you can see on your

209
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,240
screen when all said and done we'll

210
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,759
whittle these down to the top

211
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,280
12 that are most relevant for the

212
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,120
findings in the cyber espionage report

213
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,880
and for today's discussion

214
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,400
now be advised the cis controls

215
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
have been updated and version 8 should

216
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,240
be coming out next week in terms

217
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,440
of a revamp of these 20 controls there's

218
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,440
actually going to be 18

219
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,680
with several of them switched around and

220
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,120
changed up in terms of the numbering

221
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,479
system but for today

222
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,319
we'll use version seven of the critical

223
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,240
security controls

224
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,800
so the state of cyber espionage what are

225
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,400
we what are we seeing in terms of the

226
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,400
damage of an insight for that seven year

227
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,520
time frame

228
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,800
okay so first and foremost when we look

229
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,280
at the dbir data set from all the

230
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,400
different contributors

231
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,039
and in essence last year we had 81

232
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,520
different contributors to the dbir

233
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,280
this year we had 83 different

234
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,759
contributors from all around the world

235
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,680
over that seven year period we see the

236
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,680
same thing in terms of motives

237
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,080
the top two motives over that time frame

238
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,639
are financial and espionage

239
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,039
in fact you can see here as i highlight

240
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,280
in figure 38 and figure 37

241
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,319
for the seven year time frame 76 percent

242
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:28,960
of the time

243
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,560
we look at data breaches we're looking

244
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,799
at a financially motivated threat actor

245
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,559
18 of the time we're looking at an

246
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,719
espionage motivated threat actor

247
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,559
now last year those numbers were 86

248
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,000
percent and 10

249
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,880
respectively but generally speaking

250
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,399
these are the two biggest

251
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,040
motivations that we see espionage is a

252
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,120
distant second but it can be

253
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,080
a very troublesome threat actor in terms

254
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,279
of espionage

255
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,000
and it's very likely that 18 is a lot

256
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,600
higher

257
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,240
meaning this is probably a category

258
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,680
that's under reported

259
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,760
and it's under detected as well and i'll

260
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,600
talk more about that and why we suspect

261
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,240
that number of 18 over seven years is

262
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,800
probably a lot higher

263
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,880
incidentally um one of the things that

264
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,240
we've also seen for the trends over the

265
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
years as you can see in the bottom left

266
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,120
is the blue line is espionage the bottom

267
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,080
of the green line

268
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,560
is i'm sorry the blue line is financial

269
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,360
the green line

270
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,440
is espionage they tend to move the

271
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,040
mirror opposites of each other over the

272
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,760
years

273
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,920
a lot of that has to do with the the

274
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,200
data that's collected

275
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,720
but a lot of that also has to do with

276
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,320
the trends for example

277
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,320
uh we're seeing ransomware being more

278
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,920
and more a part of data breaches over

279
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,040
the last few years

280
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,800
so that's definitely impacting the

281
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,320
financially motivated

282
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,959
numbers that you're seeing so in terms

283
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,560
of the industries i mentioned there were

284
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,040
seven

285
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,560
industries that we focus on for the

286
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,560
cyber espionage report

287
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,480
we actually do have data for many more

288
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,000
than of those industries you can see

289
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,680
here in figure 16.

290
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
this is when we look across the entire

291
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,959
data sets

292
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,279
what we see in terms of cyber espionage

293
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,880
across the industries now this is just

294
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,959
across the data set in figure 16 so you

295
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:05,920
can see

296
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,800
public administration there is at 31 and

297
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:09,519
you can

298
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,440
imagine that that's probably a lucrative

299
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,279
target in terms of espionage for threat

300
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,480
actors because they're looking for

301
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,760
nation state advantage

302
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,079
where else to find it but in the public

303
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:18,880
sector

304
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,079
manufacturing is number two 22 and

305
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,880
professional

306
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,200
which is more like consulting is at 11

307
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,959
now that's across the entire data set

308
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:27,839
looking at 1

309
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,440
580 breaches of the 70 year time frame

310
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,240
figure 17 when we look within each one

311
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,240
of those industries

312
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,600
we see a little bit of a different

313
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,920
dynamic there for example

314
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,760
manufacturing was 22 16 figure 16

315
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,600
but when we look within manufacturing at

316
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,480
the 985 data breaches that occurred

317
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,200
we see 344 of them are actually start

318
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,720
rescuing us related so

319
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,760
that's one one out of three 35 percent

320
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,440
so a much higher percentage when we look

321
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,279
within each industry

322
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,880
other examples there are public

323
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,240
administration 2152 data breaches of

324
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,800
those 485 of those

325
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,040
are cyber espionage related and you can

326
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,920
see financial there at the bottom 2797

327
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,959
data breaches

328
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,360
but only 42 of those are site rescue

329
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,320
knowledge related

330
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,560
the vast majority of the other breaches

331
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,079
are financially motivated

332
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,320
in that sector but just because an

333
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,600
industry doesn't rank

334
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,200
high for cyber rescue knowledge on these

335
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,720
charts doesn't mean they can't be a

336
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,519
victim

337
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,760
of cyber espionage every industry has

338
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,040
some kind of trade secrets or

339
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,720
proprietary information

340
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,279
that needs to be protected by from cyber

341
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,519
espionage threat actors

342
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,160
so some other ways to look at threat

343
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,279
actors

344
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,440
in particular for the cyber espionage

345
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,800
threat actors is from

346
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,160
uh timelines for time frames

347
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,279
so this first slide here is timelines of

348
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,079
attackers the second slide after this

349
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,959
will be timelines of the defenders

350
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,360
now when you're seeing the dark color

351
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,279
green which is generally speaking on the

352
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:02,480
left hand side

353
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,440
that's cyber espionage on the right hand

354
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,000
side

355
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,120
is all breeches the dark blue okay so

356
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,279
if you recall all breaches are dominated

357
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,200
by a financial

358
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,279
motive so you can kind of equate that to

359
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,040
financially motivated breaches generally

360
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,920
speaking

361
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,839
whereas on the left hand side for the

362
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,279
cyber rescue notice that's pure

363
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,720
espionage motive

364
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,040
okay so when we look at figure six and

365
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,839
figure seven which is time to compromise

366
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,760
the timing it takes for the threat

367
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,920
actors to get into the environment

368
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,160
we see a bit of a difference for the all

369
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,920
reaches which is dominated by that

370
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,160
financial motive in figure seven

371
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,600
we see that generally speaking we're

372
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,920
talking seconds to minutes eighty-five

373
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,200
percent of the time in fact

374
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,680
seventy percent of the time is minutes

375
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,279
when we look at time of compromise for

376
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,120
cyber espionage breaches

377
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,440
we see a different dynamic there it's

378
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,880
seconds to days

379
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,279
and it's kind of flatlined there twenty

380
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,079
three percent

381
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,600
nineteen percent twenty three percent

382
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,920
twenty six percent for seconds to days

383
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,320
so this is your low and slow or slow and

384
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,200
low movement

385
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,560
by these threat actors they're very

386
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,720
methodical whereas for the s

387
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,320
for the all breaches dominated by that

388
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,760
financial motive they tend to be much

389
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,680
faster

390
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,680
it's time to exfiltration we can see

391
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,720
that it's minutes

392
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,959
weeks for cyber espionage breaches

393
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,680
versus minutes of days for all breaches

394
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,240
so

395
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,480
again a little bit slower here in terms

396
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,959
of the cyber espionage threat actors

397
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,279
now when we look at the cyber defenders

398
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,040
in those timelines we're looking at time

399
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,320
to discovery

400
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
and time to containment so for time to

401
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,440
discovery

402
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,120
this to me is very interesting it really

403
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,440
does tell the tale of dwell time

404
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,360
for cyber estimates threat actors it's

405
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,920
months to years 69 percent of the time

406
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,680
and that's years plural and you can see

407
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,000
that on the chart there in figure 10

408
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,560
39 of the time it's years that's a long

409
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,079
time for those threat actors to be in

410
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,120
the environment

411
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,959
a lot of damage that could potentially

412
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,199
occur with that dwell time

413
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,720
but when we look at titan discovery in

414
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,560
figure 11 for all breaches again

415
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,480
dominated by a financial mode we see it

416
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:00,880
peaks

417
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,839
38 from it for months and then it trends

418
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:04,320
down

419
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,360
to 12 for years okay and if you think

420
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,040
about it it makes sense for financial

421
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,399
threat actors they're

422
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,600
they're looking to conduct a pci attack

423
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,360
payment card industry attack business

424
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,399
email compromise

425
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,000
fraud stealing phi pii data and then

426
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,959
looking to monetize that quickly whereas

427
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,320
when we look at the cyber espionage

428
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,240
threat actors and in particular

429
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,160
shortly we'll look at the data they're

430
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,440
looking for

431
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,120
data that isn't going to be monetized

432
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,639
right away they're looking for data

433
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,160
that's going to give them competitive

434
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,040
advantage

435
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,480
nation state advantage and that's your

436
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,880
trade secrets of proprietary information

437
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,680
so it's not going to be discovered by an

438
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,160
external fraud entity or law enforcement

439
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,440
or cpp analysis or customers where their

440
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,959
credit card goes fraud

441
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,279
or financially motivated threat actors

442
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,079
nobody may be

443
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,560
missing the data in figure 10 that's

444
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,320
been exfiltrated by

445
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,839
the cyber estimates threat actors and

446
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,000
therefore they're going under

447
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,720
undiscovered for months and years when

448
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,000
you look at time to containment which

449
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,600
also includes time to recovery it's a

450
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,440
little bit more normal between

451
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,480
figure 12 and figure 13. it's days to

452
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,839
months for cyber espionage

453
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,320
hours to weeks for financial threat

454
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,120
actors

455
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,880
now if you've done digital forensics

456
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,800
investigations like i've done

457
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,360
you know that it can take a while to to

458
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,480
dig out

459
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,160
the cyber espionage threat actors from

460
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,440
the environment they tend to be pretty

461
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,399
embedded

462
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,920
they're living off the land and blending

463
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,160
into the forest whereas for the

464
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,000
s or the the financially motivated

465
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,680
threat actors the all breaches there in

466
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,880
figure 13.

467
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,959
once you find that ram scraper for pci

468
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,320
attacks or the malware that they're

469
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,279
using

470
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,120
it's a rather quick to contain and

471
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:44,079
eradicate as compared to cyber espionage

472
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,079
now in terms of discovery this was

473
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,199
interesting as well

474
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,000
and figure 31 at the top is cyber

475
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,759
espionage breach discovery

476
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,959
figure 32 the bottom blue bars is the

477
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,160
alt braces for

478
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,839
discovery and we're seeing two different

479
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,320
generally speaking at the top three for

480
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,000
beat both of these categories

481
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,160
two different ways that these breaches

482
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,440
are being discovered

483
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,199
for example in figure 32 for all

484
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,480
breaches

485
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,959
it's the law enforcement at 28 fraud

486
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,160
detection at 19

487
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,639
customers of 15 somebody's missing that

488
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,600
data

489
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,880
somebody's missing that the monetary

490
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,160
value of that data

491
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,079
somebody's detecting it being sold on

492
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,440
the dark web

493
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,759
somebody's seeing fraud and and

494
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:28,480
notifying

495
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,240
the victim organization the merchant

496
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,399
that maybe they've had a pci breach

497
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,480
whereas in figure 31 for site rescue

498
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,160
noise breaches

499
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,399
we've got technical detection means

500
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,320
internal to the organization which is

501
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,440
different than what we're seeing in

502
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,639
figure 32

503
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,720
at least the top three categories and

504
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,560
these technical detection or

505
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,560
discovery means or suspicious traffic at

506
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,240
48 of the time

507
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,880
48 of the time that's that's one out of

508
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,880
two times it's suspicious traffic that

509
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,399
leads to the discovery of cyber escaping

510
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,519
those breaches

511
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,920
anti-virus at 23 and then the computer

512
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,519
emergency response team at seven percent

513
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,800
so these are internal

514
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,799
technical discovery means but they're

515
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,199
taking a lot longer to discover cyber

516
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,640
espionage breaches

517
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,400
then all breaches or the financially

518
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,280
motivated breaches are being discovered

519
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,880
incidentally in the bottom left of the

520
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,199
screen are the top controls

521
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,520
for the critical security controls uh

522
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,359
for the timeline slides as well

523
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,359
uh they're down at the bottom left here

524
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,039
things such as maintenance monitoring

525
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,160
analysis of

526
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,240
audit logs your malware and boundary

527
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,600
defenses as well as your instant

528
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,840
response

529
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,280
capabilities let's look at the a4 threat

530
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,120
model here to better understand what the

531
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,120
threat actors are up to

532
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,200
so we can kind of see the difference

533
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,200
between the cyber espionage

534
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,799
versus the all breaches so the a4 threat

535
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,440
model is a sub-component of varus

536
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,679
these are the four a's the accuracy

537
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,640
actions the assets and the attributes

538
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,120
now this uh you can kind of maybe even

539
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,840
think of this as

540
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,320
similar to the diamond model the actors

541
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,200
and the actions actually go hand in hand

542
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,880
and the assets and the attributes go

543
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,799
hand in hand as well

544
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,120
so let's look at the actors there are

545
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,640
three types of actors

546
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,520
that we track within the dvir and within

547
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,840
the varus framework they're the external

548
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,880
internal and partner so external actors

549
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,000
do not have

550
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,240
any legitimate access to the environment

551
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,240
they're they're external physically and

552
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,520
logically to

553
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,200
the data the assets in the environment

554
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,880
internal actors

555
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,880
are your employees your system

556
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,039
administrators your end users folks who

557
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,440
have some level of trust and privilege

558
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,600
but not necessarily an insider threat

559
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,200
but they are doing things that lead to a

560
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:37,919
breach

561
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,320
such as committing errors

562
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:41,120
misconfigurations

563
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,799
partners are somewhere in between in

564
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,320
terms of their access they're not quite

565
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,840
external they're not quite internal they

566
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,960
have some level

567
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,679
of trust and privilege so historically

568
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,520
what you're seeing here in in the screen

569
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,559
for actors

570
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,559
the bottom left shows you those three

571
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:55,760
actor types

572
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,919
the blue is the external actors they

573
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,520
have been the number one actor of the

574
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,200
seven year time frame

575
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,360
green is the internal distance second

576
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,960
but the number two actor

577
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,799
and then partners run of the gray line

578
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,080
at the very bottom

579
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,799
okay so for for today's discussion we're

580
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,720
looking at external actors

581
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,160
okay and we're going to be looking at

582
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,799
those external actors again

583
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,760
with the espionage motive so the figure

584
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,559
34

585
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,799
is the cyber rescue knowledge breaches

586
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,160
at the top and

587
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,240
figure 35 is the alt breaches and keep

588
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,919
that keep in mind that that's dominated

589
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,440
by that financial motive

590
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,960
so i highlighted here that the top actor

591
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,480
varieties within both of those two

592
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,240
figures you see here

593
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
so the active varieties are actually one

594
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,400
layer below the actor types

595
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,160
so for instance we've got state

596
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,679
affiliated highlighted

597
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,480
there that is an external actor nation

598
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,840
state is external actor

599
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,080
as well as organized crime but when we

600
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,679
see former employee that's also an

601
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:54,799
external actor

602
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,480
competitor is external but when you see

603
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,240
end user and activate or end user and

604
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,520
developer those are

605
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,840
internal actors just just for uh

606
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,200
clarification there

607
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,440
so when we compare 34 and 35 the two

608
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,760
figures there we see state affiliated is

609
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,240
number one by far at 85 percent

610
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,679
for psycho espionage creatures and

611
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,520
that's probably no surprise

612
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,360
nation state is number two at eight

613
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,320
percent so combined those two are 93

614
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,880
of the time that you're dealing with a

615
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,799
state affiliate or nation-state threat

616
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,240
act now state-affiliated

617
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,240
isn't quite nation-state they're

618
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,000
supported blessed off or at least

619
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:28,880
approved by

620
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,799
or affiliated in some way shape or form

621
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,480
for the nation-state

622
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,080
on the bottom there the number one

623
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,000
threat actor for all breaches is

624
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,840
organized crime at 59

625
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,640
a very very um high percentage compared

626
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,520
to

627
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,159
the next uh category to state affiliate

628
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,880
13

629
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,640
so that makes sense organized crime

630
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,280
tends to align with the financial motive

631
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,880
and when we're looking at all breaches

632
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,880
that's dominated by the financial motive

633
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,080
so

634
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,600
we're looking at these two we're seeing

635
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,080
state affiliated versus organized crimes

636
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,400
in terms of the two categories now we're

637
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,760
not going to talk about actions right

638
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,000
now

639
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,280
i'm going to hold that off until a

640
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,880
little bit later but these are the

641
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,640
assets this is on the victims side of

642
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,360
the coin

643
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,600
okay these are the seven asset types

644
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,799
that we track within

645
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,039
the dvir and reported within the cyber

646
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,240
espionage report

647
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,320
so we've got server people user device

648
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,320
terminal network embedded in media

649
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,640
we're going to focus today on server

650
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,640
people and user device and to a certain

651
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,919
extent on network

652
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,880
so these are the asset types this is

653
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,159
great to know

654
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,880
but what's even more informative is that

655
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,240
it's the details which

656
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,400
are the asset varieties that underlie

657
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,360
each of these asset

658
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,799
types so in terms of assets

659
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,720
this is what we're seeing in figure 24

660
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,320
and tip 25

661
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,080
for cyber espionage versus all breaches

662
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,799
okay so if parentheses is the asset type

663
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,960
outside of the parentheses is the asset

664
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,320
variety so for example

665
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,039
desktop or laptop in parentheses is a

666
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,480
user device type

667
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,280
so the variety is desktop or laptop so

668
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,200
interestingly for cyber espionage threat

669
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,280
actors in figure 24

670
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,600
we see that they are targeting desktops

671
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,960
or laptops

672
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,360
desktops and mobile phones the top three

673
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,159
categories there are user devices

674
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,159
then that fourth category there is a

675
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,120
network type which is a router a switch

676
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,640
on the right hand side when we look at

677
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,240
the asset varieties for all breaches

678
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,919
dominated by that financial motive we

679
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,679
see that those threat actors

680
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:28,000
are mixing it up more so than the cyber

681
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,679
espionage threat actors

682
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,600
desktop or laptop yes certainly is

683
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,760
number one but next we see a server

684
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,520
web application server and that makes

685
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,159
sense because within the overall dbi our

686
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,720
data set we see web app server attacks

687
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,720
or web app attacks i should say

688
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,840
being a very very high percentage in

689
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,960
terms of

690
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,760
a go-to for for breaches in general in

691
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,600
terms of those threat actors

692
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,919
e-commerce attacks presence that folks

693
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,039
have on the internet for their

694
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,159
businesses

695
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,240
and uh and so it just makes sense and

696
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,679
then there's the desktop there and then

697
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,200
point-of-sale controller point-of-sale

698
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,000
terminal

699
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,400
which is affiliated with pci attacks

700
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,679
database servers

701
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,919
customers yes we do code people as

702
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,120
assets

703
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,679
and email servers as well so a big

704
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,280
difference here in terms of assets the

705
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,559
cyber estimates right actors are

706
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:15,840
targeting the users

707
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,679
and more specifically these are devices

708
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,880
to gain access into the environment

709
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,000
so the attributes we track the three

710
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,080
see uh the confidentiality integrity and

711
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,720
availability the cia triad in terms of

712
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,240
types

713
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:33,520
though in terms of integrity

714
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,360
this is the uh attribute variety for

715
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,480
integrity okay and the attribute variety

716
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,559
for

717
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:45,200
confidentiality okay availability is not

718
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,760
on here

719
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,480
typically the availability would be more

720
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,679
affiliated with

721
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,760
cyber security incidents dos attacks

722
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,440
ransomware incidents

723
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,240
but here we're talking about breaches so

724
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,520
the top

725
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,000
uh compromised attributed varieties are

726
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,960
more

727
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,600
confidentiality related and integrity

728
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,960
related

729
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,480
now for what you're seeing in figure 20

730
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,080
and figure 21

731
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,840
this is integrity that i've highlighted

732
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,279
here these are the top

733
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,840
integrity related attribute varieties

734
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,440
for cyber espionage

735
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,039
and for all breaches so interestingly

736
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,640
most of the time so far we've talked

737
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,640
about two different tales between all

738
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,279
breeches and cyber espionage breaches

739
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,400
what we're seeing here is the top two

740
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,120
attribute varieties impacted by breaches

741
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,000
for both side espionage and

742
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,720
all breaches is software installation

743
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,400
and alter behavior so software

744
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,080
installation is what it sounds like

745
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,640
it's impacting the installation of the

746
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,360
software

747
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,520
because a recent example like solar

748
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,279
winds the attack there

749
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,200
okay so this is seven years worth of

750
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,360
data this is prior to solar winds this

751
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,880
has been going on for some time where

752
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,880
the threat actors are taking advantage

753
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,520
of software installation and corrupting

754
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,080
that

755
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,480
you know impacting the integrity of that

756
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,320
whether they're doing cyber espionage

757
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,000
or whether they're doing financially

758
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,919
motivated breaches now

759
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,279
when you look at the percentages you can

760
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,440
see 91 percent for cyber estimates

761
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,640
versus 43

762
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,279
for all breaches but again the number

763
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,080
one

764
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,000
compromise after variety is software

765
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,679
installation followed by the human

766
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,480
elements

767
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,640
altering behavior altering the integrity

768
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,400
of that person getting somebody to click

769
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,640
on a hyperlink in a phishing email

770
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,880
or go to a fake website getting somebody

771
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,400
to do something

772
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,480
um that they shouldn't be doing leading

773
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,159
to a data breach so ultra behavior is

774
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,440
the number two

775
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,440
for both cyber espionage and for all

776
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,720
breaches

777
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,600
and then we're going to cover

778
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,840
confidentiality in the next slide but

779
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,039
you can see

780
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,120
there's a bit of a divergence then for

781
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,960
cyber espionage we're talking about

782
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,440
modifying the configuration of something

783
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,520
versus fraudulent transaction

784
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,000
in terms of all breaches so bits to

785
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,320
learn here in terms of the attributes

786
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,279
when it comes to cyber threat actors and

787
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,760
all breaches in general

788
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,520
you look at the confidentiality this is

789
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,120
probably

790
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,960
one of the the more contrasts here

791
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,480
between uh

792
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,559
the two different types of data that

793
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,000
we're looking at today

794
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,799
so on the left hand side of figure 29 is

795
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,159
top compromise

796
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,919
data varieties which is impacting

797
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,440
confidentiality

798
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,000
in cyclic recipients breaches and what

799
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,600
you're seeing there is your trade

800
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,360
secrets at 75

801
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,840
internal data at 30 fold like

802
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,480
credentialed

803
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,159
system and government classified

804
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,159
information at nine percent

805
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,159
okay so this is you can kind of think of

806
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,000
this as the intangible data

807
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,080
as compared to tangible data in figure

808
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,679
30 this is

809
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,760
the the data that needs to be defined

810
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,279
since your

811
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,360
your trade secrets this is your

812
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,120
proprietary information

813
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,039
but it's information that's this that's

814
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,640
not as easy to grip

815
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,200
for uh it's rather easy to look for

816
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,039
social security numbers that are

817
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,039
walking out the door but it's not so

818
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,799
easy to look for trade secrets you have

819
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,320
to understand where they are in your

820
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,360
environment

821
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,200
and what they are to be able to look for

822
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,200
in that suspicious traffic

823
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,320
in figure 30 we can see it's a bit

824
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,159
different bit of a different story here

825
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,919
in terms of the data that's compromised

826
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,679
we're talking user credentials

827
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,679
okay and user credentials are number

828
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,760
three in the list in figure 29

829
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,600
but they're number one on the list for

830
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,279
figure 30 at 31

831
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,760
because those can be monetized those can

832
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,399
be

833
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,080
exfiltrated from the environment and

834
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,919
sold in the dark web to give another

835
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:26,799
hacker

836
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,120
another attacker accessed back into that

837
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,240
environment

838
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,320
personal information is at 31 and that's

839
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,000
your pii payments

840
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,360
23 that's your pci medical 13

841
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,840
that's your phi all data types there in

842
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,399
that red box that can be monetized for

843
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,960
for quick gain by those financially

844
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,399
activated threat actors

845
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:47,520
okay and i know we're talking all

846
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:50,159
breaches but keep in mind 76 percent of

847
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,600
the time over that seven year period is

848
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,000
a

849
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,559
financial motivation that dominates

850
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,880
whereas in figure 29

851
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,559
we're seeing data that wouldn't we

852
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,080
wouldn't expect it to be sold on the

853
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,520
dark web it's going to be used in a

854
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,200
closed-loop system it's going to be used

855
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,039
by that

856
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:05,679
state-affiliated entity that

857
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,840
nation-state for competitive advantage

858
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,559
for

859
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,320
national security advantage they're not

860
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,760
going to be selling that data on the

861
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,640
dark web

862
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,080
the credentials are going to be used for

863
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,919
access back into the environment or

864
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,760
greater access within the environment if

865
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,880
they happen to

866
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,559
get a hold of some system administrative

867
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,120
credentials

868
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,360
but let's talk about the actions so

869
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,120
there are seven action types that we

870
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,640
track and we've tracked over the years

871
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,080
for the data breach investigations

872
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,200
report

873
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,440
today we're going to talk about social

874
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,200
malware and hacking

875
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,159
i will comment that missed use is goes

876
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,720
hand in hand with the internal actors

877
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,960
this is misuse or abuse of something

878
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,120
hardware software credentials

879
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,360
okay and we would need to pair up the

880
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,279
misuse action with the internal actor to

881
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,200
get ourselves to the point where we have

882
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,880
an insider threat

883
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,960
error is big in terms of breaches it was

884
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,720
big last year in the dbir we're not

885
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,240
going to talk about error today

886
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,840
and then physical and environmental are

887
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,159
probably our two least impacted

888
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,919
uh action types and you've seen them

889
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:06,399
years for data breaches

890
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,039
so for actions looking at a very high

891
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,039
level here the action types

892
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,760
you can see the top three action types

893
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,360
are the same for cyber espionage

894
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,240
breaches

895
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,000
in all breaches malware social and

896
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,039
hacking hacking malware and social

897
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,600
respectively but what we see for cyber

898
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:24,720
espionage breaches

899
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,799
is there's much more of a reliance

900
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,320
percentage-wise

901
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,480
on malware social hacking ranging

902
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,840
between 80 and 90

903
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,799
of the time versus figure 40 with all

904
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:36,399
breaches where we're seeing social

905
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,279
malware

906
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,760
and hacking ranging from 29 to 56

907
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,600
percent of the time in fact

908
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:45,200
you can see in figure 40 error is at 16

909
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,080
minutes uses 11 physicals at six percent

910
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,799
whereas it's

911
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,279
barely represented in figure nine

912
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:53,600
misuses that two percent

913
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,279
incidentally a good example of physical

914
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:56,880
would be payment card skimmers

915
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,600
and that's why that's uh looking at six

916
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,039
percent there for all breaches because

917
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:03,600
of that financial motivation

918
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,200
so this is great but this is not very

919
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,760
helpful let's look one layer down below

920
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,799
the action types

921
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,360
the action varieties for the malware the

922
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,000
social

923
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,880
hacking so we'll talk about social first

924
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,000
so social

925
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:19,600
and this is probably a surprise to folks

926
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,960
for all breaches in figure 44 87 percent

927
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,399
of the time the threat actors are

928
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:25,039
leveraging

929
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,880
email social engineering featuring

930
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,399
spearfishing

931
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,279
nine percent of the time it's pretexting

932
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,000
okay

933
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,320
but for cyber espionage it's surprising

934
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,279
to me that it was

935
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,080
actually outpacing all breaches and if

936
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,840
you look at figure 43 you see cyber

937
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,159
espionage 97 percent of the time

938
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,760
when they're using social attacks

939
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,520
they're using fishing

940
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,039
but only two percent of time for

941
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,440
pre-texting so i would have thought you

942
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,279
know well cyber espionage you know

943
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:52,720
pre-texting should be a lot higher than

944
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,720
two percent what's actually higher

945
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,480
in all breaches of nine percent than it

946
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,399
is inside rear espionage

947
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,399
so another example here where the two

948
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,320
tails are the same between

949
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,799
cyber espionage breaches and all reaches

950
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,480
but most of the time we've seen a lot of

951
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,000
difference in terms of the data when we

952
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,320
look

953
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,159
at both uh at both data sets

954
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,480
but hacking is the second action type

955
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,519
that we'll look at now these are the

956
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,440
action varieties for hacking

957
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,679
the toughest cyber espionage the bottom

958
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,200
is all breaches

959
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,640
so when we look at the way

960
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,760
that the hackers tend to operate

961
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,480
we see that for cyber espionage threat

962
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,200
actors

963
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,840
they leverage the use of a backdoor or a

964
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,919
c2 commander control channel

965
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,039
86 of the time that's their go-to

966
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:41,760
hacking ash variety okay now you're

967
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,960
probably wondering well

968
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,960
backdoor c2 those are two different

969
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,320
things it's just they are but this is

970
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,159
just the hacking action variety

971
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,080
the next slide will have malware and

972
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,840
we'll see that those are split out

973
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,320
separately next is use of stolen

974
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,600
credentials of 30

975
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,039
and if they don't have those stolen

976
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,679
credentials they're brute forcing at 12

977
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:01,519
and when we look at all breaches in

978
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,679
figure 46 we see use of stolen

979
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,399
credentials is at 63 percent and that

980
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:07,519
makes sense that's what we've been

981
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,039
seeing a number of years in terms of

982
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,720
financially motivated threat actors and

983
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,399
all breaches in general

984
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,799
use of back doors at 39 and then brute

985
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,120
forcing is at 18

986
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,880
so this is hacking action varieties now

987
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,880
let's look at malware

988
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,360
okay so this is malware action varieties

989
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,519
left side is cyber espionage and right

990
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:27,120
side is all breeches

991
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,120
so here's the split out between backdoor

992
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,720
and c2 and figure 47

993
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,000
78 of time it's backdoor 77

994
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,559
it's of the time it's c2 when we look

995
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,880
over at figure 48 it all breaches we see

996
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,600
c2 is only at 48

997
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,840
and then you can see you don't even see

998
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,519
back door until it's 25

999
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:48,720
right down below the red box okay so for

1000
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,720
the cyber espionage by

1001
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,799
far their malware go to varieties are

1002
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,640
backdoor and c2

1003
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,559
and then distantly there at third and

1004
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,799
fourth is downloader at 40

1005
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,080
and captured store data

1006
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,840
if you look over at all breaches in

1007
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,440
figure 48 we see spyware keylogger at 40

1008
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,320
ram scraper at 35 percent and then it

1009
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,240
starts falling off from there

1010
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,080
one of the things i want to point out is

1011
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,440
halfway down both

1012
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,519
charts you see admin where admin we're

1013
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,840
at seven percent in figure 48

1014
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,880
admin we're at 21 in figure 47.

1015
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,559
this is your living off the land so the

1016
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,039
cyber espionage threat actors prefer

1017
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,679
to the extent they can to use the tools

1018
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,120
that are already in the environment why

1019
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:31,600
bring

1020
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,200
additional tools into the environment

1021
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,519
risk detection why not just use the

1022
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,039
tools that are already there

1023
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,840
ps exact

1024
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,720
powershell any admin tools if you've got

1025
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,480
the admin privileges the tools are there

1026
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,240
you use them and that's what they do

1027
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,679
they know that that'll lessen their

1028
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,200
chance for detection or at least delay

1029
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,159
detection

1030
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,320
they also know that it will delay uh the

1031
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,000
investigative response effort when the

1032
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,919
forensics folks are looking

1033
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,080
for artifacts on the systems and looking

1034
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,000
at log entries and they're seeing

1035
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,080
a mixture of legitimate activity with

1036
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,519
that particular tool

1037
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,200
and nefarious activity of that

1038
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,720
particular tool and it does slow down

1039
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,000
the investigative response effort

1040
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,918
because then you have to determine

1041
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,440
what were the good guys girls doing

1042
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,000
versus what the threat actor was doing

1043
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,599
other things such as scan network and

1044
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,679
disabled controls are all examples of

1045
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,679
what the threat actor would do at 18

1046
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,800
13 in terms of living off land

1047
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,599
and configure modifying configurations

1048
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,280
and disabling things

1049
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,199
uh whereas you're not seeing that as

1050
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:30,800
high of a percentage of when you all

1051
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,239
reach this category because those

1052
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,239
those threat actors tend to it's not

1053
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,839
that they're ad not as

1054
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,760
sophisticated as psychological actors

1055
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,119
they're just looking at different data

1056
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,040
types they're looking to get in

1057
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,079
excellent that data and and monetize it

1058
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,520
as quickly as possible

1059
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,879
so they're not so concerned about the

1060
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,280
dwell time

1061
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,918
okay it's way forward so just to kind of

1062
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,359
highlight some of the findings here that

1063
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:54,639
we went over to

1064
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,480
um please check out the cyber rescue

1065
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,400
knowledge reports there's all kinds of

1066
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:58,960
additional

1067
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,280
data in the report there's also two

1068
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,359
pages dedicated to seven of the

1069
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,440
industries in terms of specifics with

1070
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,280
cyber espionage

1071
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,040
so at a high level here when we're

1072
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,280
looking at actors 93 percent of the time

1073
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,960
we're dealing with state-affiliated

1074
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,599
nation-state actors for cyber espionage

1075
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:17,440
91 percent of the time we're dealing

1076
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,760
with the attributes of software

1077
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,440
installation which is impacting

1078
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,280
integrity at 91

1079
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,200
and then we see alter behavior which is

1080
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,560
impacting integrity at 84

1081
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,160
90 percent of the time we're dealing

1082
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,920
with malware action

1083
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,480
followed by social at 83 and hacking at

1084
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,599
80 percent

1085
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,599
and then in terms of assets keep in mind

1086
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,040
for cyber estimated strategies are

1087
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,880
targeting those user devices

1088
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,720
desktops or laptops at 89 desktops at 80

1089
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,280
and mobile phones at nine percent so

1090
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,400
these are the a4

1091
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,880
threat model elements actors actions

1092
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,720
attributes and assets

1093
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,839
when we look more deeply into action

1094
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,280
types or action varieties

1095
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,680
ninety-seven percent of the time we're

1096
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,119
dealing with fishing at ninety-seven

1097
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,240
percent

1098
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,400
pre-texting at two percent and bribery

1099
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,000
at one percent

1100
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,400
and then for hacking eighty-six percent

1101
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,520
of time we're dealing with

1102
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,839
use of backdoor c2 followed by use of

1103
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,839
storm credentials at thirty percent

1104
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,640
and brute force twelve percent malware

1105
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,480
at seventy eight percent is back door

1106
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,520
followed by

1107
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,599
commanding control seventy seven percent

1108
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,200
your downloader and you're capturing

1109
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,480
stored data

1110
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,359
and then also in terms of vectors

1111
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:28,560
malware vectors

1112
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,520
for the pair up generally speaking with

1113
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,280
the male reaction varieties were email

1114
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,520
attachments at 67

1115
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,240
and email links at 17 followed by web

1116
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,839
drive buys and download by malware

1117
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:44,160
so this is an eye chart i do realize

1118
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,200
that but this

1119
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,040
this is spelled out in the actual report

1120
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,760
itself what we do is we map the varus

1121
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,800
category

1122
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,040
on the very left with the cyber

1123
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,000
espionage report

1124
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,800
key takeaways on the next column and in

1125
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,480
the very center are the top

1126
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,079
center for internet security critical

1127
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,960
security controls version seven

1128
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,640
with the mappings there to the findings

1129
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,839
and then in the far right is the

1130
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,760
deduplicated controls down to the 12

1131
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,280
unique ones that we came up

1132
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,960
with in terms of the insight provided by

1133
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,599
the cyber espionage reports so these are

1134
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:18,800
the 12 controls

1135
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,599
and so you can see them these are the 12

1136
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,200
highlighted in green

1137
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,279
out of the 20 security controls

1138
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,280
if you're interested in varus and

1139
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,640
learning more

1140
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,480
you can simply go to

1141
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:33,359
bearishcommunity.net it's an open source

1142
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:34,240
framework

1143
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,280
you can use varus to code your incidents

1144
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,720
within your organization

1145
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,960
you can use varus to better understand

1146
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,720
the dbir and the cyber rescue knows

1147
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,680
report

1148
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,560
there's also a web application app or a

1149
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,920
web app i should say

1150
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,200
on github.com this you can use that

1151
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,200
to go ahead and code your incidents and

1152
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,040
we also do have an open source

1153
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,800
various community database project where

1154
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,800
we code publicly disclosed breaches and

1155
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,480
cybersecurity incidents

1156
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:03,599
for use for analysis as well as being a

1157
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,000
contributor to the dvi air itself

1158
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,680
i do want to just let folks know the

1159
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,160
link on the very bottom of your screen

1160
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,960
for the dbir is live we just went live

1161
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,720
today for the 2021 data breach

1162
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,240
investigations report

1163
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,800
14 years of data 88 countries 83

1164
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,320
contributors

1165
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:24,520
29 207 quality incidents analyzed and

1166
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,320
5258 data breaches

1167
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,640
analyzed lots of good information in

1168
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,720
there in terms of what we're seeing with

1169
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,320
breaches especially

1170
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,359
in the a's of covid so covid19 data from

1171
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,839
last year is included in the report

1172
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,520
that brings us to the very end we do

1173
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,720
have a couple of minutes is there any

1174
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,320
questions

1175
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,760
cool well thank you john quite around

1176
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,760
applause for john quickly

1177
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:50,240
[Applause]

1178
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,079
now you can answer your questions via

1179
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,079
the app and there was one question in

1180
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:54,720
