discussing manufacturing ics

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,480
or industrial control systems security

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,840

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,079
industrial control system

28
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,160
networks are related to the

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,520
manufacturing space

30
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,280
so can we give a warm welcome for carl

31
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,479

i was in australia and last in march

42
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,320
of 2020 and i came back to north

43
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,079
carolina here

44
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,280
um and everyone was in a panic um

45
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,320
and this covet thing and we were out of

46
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,119
toilet paper

47
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,079
i couldn't get that right so now um

48
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:46,560
today

49
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,439
here in north carolina uh we are one of

50
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,360
the states where everybody is in a panic

51
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,920
and we are out of gasoline and petrol

52
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,600
from the colonial pipeline

53
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,200
uh ransomware attack so uh so it's uh

54
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,759
interesting times here um you know in

55
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,560
north carolina um but i'm glad

56
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,840
um go to the next slide

57
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,760
so background a good chunk of it has

58
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,400
been from the ip security side so that's

59
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
how i tend to look at the you know ot

60
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,720
and manufacturing roles and engagements

61
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,920
um through that lens um you know this

62
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,560
includes

63
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,800
seeing where your security operations

64
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,680
can be

65
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,440
um similar uh you know and unique

66
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,239
and especially as it relates to um you

67
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,160
know small businesses there

68
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,519
um so i got motivated for this talk

69
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,840
um you know due to challenges that i was

70
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,720
saying

71
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,720
um you know with small and medium

72
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,160
businesses um

73
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,080
yeah i appreciate it more and more you

74
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,760
know

75
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,879
you know in my career as i look at it um

76
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,599
sort of the flow down requirements um

77
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,319
you know

78
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,360
and um you know and that you know when i

79
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,319
was

80
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,519
in 2009 i was working in aerospace for

81
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,800
uh tscp um there which um which is

82
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,640
amongst the primes and i had to put

83
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,599
together

84
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,120
um a secure email um standard

85
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,640
and that was about 150 pages and was

86
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,680
working with the

87
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,680
aerospace industry um industries

88
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,040
association and aerospace and defense

89
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,840
industries association of europe um and

90
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,760
in that

91
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,200
i was told the average supplier was uh

92
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,840
10 to 30 um you know employees pretty

93
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:38,239
much

94
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,000
so uh they couldn't handle 150 page

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,840
standards um so you know so with that

96
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,200
again it helped me appreciate it

97
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,200
especially with connectivity with it and

98
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,239
ot systems

99
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:54,239
um and things like erp and manufacturing

100
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,640
execution systems that address those

101
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,360
challenges

102
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,480
and i wanted to you know

103
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,920
make sure in this presentation i cover

104
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,439
the importance of the manufacturing

105
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,360
industry

106
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,519
over to small and medium businesses and

107
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,599
i think you know they've expressed

108
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,599
expressed the greatest challenges and

109
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,720
provide

110
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,880
security operations strategy i think uh

111
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,680
which also provide guidance on how to

112
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,720
measure maturity

113
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,919
and discuss opportunities for soar so

114
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,320
i think i'm gonna do here i'm actually

115
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,240
getting a blinking on the slides it's

116
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,240
flashing it might be my graphics card

117
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,600
i'm going to minimize and when i say

118
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,520
next slide i'll just also call out the

119
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:33,919
number

120
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,680
of them so hopefully that's okay

121
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,800
yeah it's cool you are coming through a

122
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,160
little bit choppy so there might be a

123
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,960
video card there

124
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,560
let me know

125
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,199
so we'll go to the next slide which is

126
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,520
slide

127
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,760
so for that um

128
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,040
[Music]

129
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,400
manufacturing continues to be

130
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
important um that's the priority of

131
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,320
government

132
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,600
australia the modern manufacturing

133
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,479
initiative

134
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,520
and national uh manufacturing priorities

135
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,440
which were announced in 2020

136
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,720
of october have 1.3 billion dollars in

137
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,520
funding through february of 2021

138
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,240
um and the priorities of that include uh

139
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,320
resources technology and critical

140
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,080
mineral minerals processing food and

141
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,199
beverage

142
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,520
medical products recycling clean energy

143
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,039
defense and space

144
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,080
uh the head of the national cove

145
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,400
task force says manufacturing should

146
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,560
triple its contribution to

147
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,680
um the australian gdp um and in the u.s

148
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,240
we've had recent executive orders um

149
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,560
even reference in yesterday's executive

150
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,360
order

151
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,520
um which was partially as a result of

152
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,039
that um colonial

153
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,680
pipeline attack you know the focus on uh

154
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,440
manufacturing and the manufacturing

155
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,319
execution

156
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,160
partnership which is through nits a lot

157
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,360
of what i'm gonna get to

158
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,080
in terms of frameworks later came out of

159
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,600
the funding from that manufacturing

160
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,319
execution

161
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,600
um sorry extension partnership um

162
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,000
and itop convergence is happening uh

163
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,039
more and more

164
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,360
um there is increased ability um you

165
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,560
know to affect

166
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,000
um ot processes from that and more

167
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,560
cloud integration is occurring too um we

168
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,919
know from this year

169
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,720
uh vaccines are ever important to keep

170
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,600
the supply chain

171
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,440
going um and the consequences are real

172
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,560
um there can be a hub to production um

173
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,560
safety regulatory issues and so on

174
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,319
so we'll go to the next slide slide five

175
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,160
so we had a recent uh survey report

176
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,960
which was published in 2021

177
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,360
um it was multinational anonymous and

178
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,400
online

179
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,039
and it emphasized smart factories a

180
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,319
period of that was

181
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,840
whatever 20 to december 1st

182
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,840
2020

183
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,880
and the same amount were ot covering

184
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,800
technical engineering

185
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:17,840
um to security

186
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,039
we're kind of losing you a little bit

187
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,199
there maybe would you would you want to

188
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,720
shut off your video because i might be

189
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,840
consuming a little bit

190
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,840
as well sorry sure

191
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,800
no

192
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,319
no i still can't get you

193
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,080
it's probably not the video then my

194
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,878
apologies

195
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,759
what i'll do

196
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:13,840
i'm gonna take out my

197
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,679
do you i don't know if you can hear us

198
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:36,958
or not doesn't look like your bluetooth

199
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,159
headsets on but it might be the

200
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,120
bluetooth headset

201
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,399
would you have a different headset or

202
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,640
maybe just use the inbuilt microphone

203
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,080
in your laptop if you're presenting from

204
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,320
one

205
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:55,839
sorry we can't hear you

206
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,240
hmm good thing this is

207
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,480
nothing new to anyone over the past 12

208
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,839
months it's probably happened about a

209
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:19,839
billion times for me

210
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,800
i was going to work at it most likely a

211
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,440
headset issue

212
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,240
thanks everyone for your patience i

213
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,200
could tell some more

214
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,600
really terrible jokes yeah okay let me

215
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,720
let me see what i got here

216
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,519
let me dig deep

217
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,600
what did the grape do when he got

218
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,000
stepped

219
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,200
on oh

220
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,959
it's got one person leaving already you

221
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,040
haven't heard the punchline

222
00:10:53,040 --> 00:11:00,390
he let out he let out a little wine

223
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:03,669
[Music]

224
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,800
another one

225
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,519
there we go

226
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:29,839
ipv6 walks into a bar no one talks to it

227
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,480
why did the powerpoint presentation

228
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,120
cross the road

229
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,959
to get to the other slide

230
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,320
oh we're back okay that's i was telling

231
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,800
some terrible jokes while you're in

232
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,560
lucas can you hear me yes we can hear

233
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,720
you okay

234
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,360
i don't know what's going on i apologize

235
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,560
oh it's a good thing you're back i was

236
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,000
doing nothing but telling dad jokes i

237
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,120
think he's saving everyone now mate

238
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,240
i'll take it away all right um

239
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,240
hopefully that's a little bit better uh

240
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,760
i'll kind of probably pick up the base

241
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,920
just to cover the ground here

242
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,639
um so we'll go ahead to slide number

243
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,760
seven uh which is the nist um cyber

244
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,440
security framework and manufacturing

245
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,040
profile ecosystem

246
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,720
so one of the things i was gonna get is

247
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,240
how um in

248
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,839
in coming up with the cyber security

249
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,560
framework a lot of the small businesses

250
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,480
and manufacturers really struggled they

251
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,560
were one of the top commenters

252
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,920
um you know to that there um so

253
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,360
one of the keys is when you're going

254
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,360
back and you know i think

255
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,800
trying to figure out where you're at in

256
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,959
maturity and what standards and what

257
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,320
you know controls you really want to

258
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,000
shoot for especially in the security

259
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,279
operation space

260
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,120
it's good to have a look at other things

261
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,560
that you can relate to it

262
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,480
so i put this together and i put a key

263
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,399
you know to how to cross walk and do a

264
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,000
mapping right to

265
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,720
to see really getting down to the

266
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,959
implementation example level

267
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,120
um at the bottom how that is and then

268
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,440
ultimately walking that over to

269
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,160
uh tools to assess maturity such as sock

270
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:18,959
cmm

271
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,839
there and even you know as you're going

272
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:23,120
into

273
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,120
the level that you're implementing um

274
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,639
the capability there

275
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,320
and the maturity looking at things such

276
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,680
as the dhs cyber resilience review

277
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,680
but we also um see that it maps to

278
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,480
guidance um that comes from the acsc

279
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,639
there such as the essential aid

280
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,120
into some you know some initial recent

281
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,800
relatively recent initiatives in this

282
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,519
space such as

283
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,720
cyber security maturity model um

284
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,510
certification

285
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,639
[Music]

286
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,800
so we've got the next slide which is

287
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,160
slide number

288
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,959
um eight which is industry threats and

289
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,000
systems and then

290
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,360
into slide number nine um

291
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,519
so um for that um after the ukrainian

292
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,560
uh attacks on the power grid um back in

293
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,360
2015

294
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,399
and 2016 combined with

295
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,360
um the you know the miter attack

296
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,360
framework enterprise being in the

297
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,800
existence um they came up with the ics

298
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,320
matrix you start with our matrix or

299
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,240
started that work afterwards and

300
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,760
it's a great lexicon for ics um ttps

301
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,639
affecting the industry and it focuses at

302
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,600
uh zero

303
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,920
level zero to the purdue architecture

304
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,120
um you know and it's it's also

305
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,160
um you know in between um

306
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,959
and able to be referenced to the sans i

307
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,160
see skill chain

308
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:50,320
and um you know you can relate that to

309
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,399
um advisors even such as you know once

310
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,240
we learn you know about

311
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,079
you know some of the ttps with things

312
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,160
like the colonial um you know pipeline

313
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,279
attack recently

314
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,440
um and included in that is it maps to

315
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,360
this 153 rep for

316
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:07,360
um in the ice ic um 62443 series there

317
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,199
so we'll go to the next slide which is

318
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,880
slide number 10.

319
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,839
um so i picked you know three attacks

320
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:14,720
that i thought

321
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,600
um were kind of um relevant to the

322
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,639
manufacturing

323
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,240
space um so so with that we had the

324
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,680
doctor ready's attack

325
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,560
which is a pharmaceutical manufacturer

326
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,519
they were

327
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,399
they they're one of their businesses is

328
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,399
helping to supply

329
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,199
some of the therapeutics right now and

330
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,880
with covet

331
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,800
and they got hit in october 2020 with

332
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,320
ransomware it caused a temporary

333
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,920
shutdown of some of

334
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,199
its um production facilities and plants

335
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,560
um from india to the uk um

336
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,920
still haven't stored it at least that i

337
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,240
can see the initial access and it really

338
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,399
was a loss of productivity

339
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,240
and revenue that's a technique in the

340
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,680
miter um

341
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,560
attack ics matrix and then we've got

342
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,279
steel case furniture and for that

343
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,600
they may have gained initial access with

344
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,880
tripod

345
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,920
fishing and the global operations were

346
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,839
shut down for two weeks

347
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,240
um the ransomware was was suspected

348
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,399
um and they were able to randomly uh

349
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:19,360
manually deploy

350
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,160
payloads with that using ps exact in

351
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,320
power shell empire

352
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,959
um so that used to exploit a remote

353
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,320
services technique that's why i picked

354
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,040
out on that

355
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,639
and then on with old smart um

356
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,320
florida i thought that was interesting

357
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,040
because teamviewer got beat up um in

358
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,079
that and i know

359
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,440
you know that's services such as that

360
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,800
um you know are you know

361
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,399
are problematic throughout all the

362
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,399
manufacturing so that is that a perfect

363
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:48,720
fit

364
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,560
um in the manufacturing industry but i

365
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,639
think the architecture um

366
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,079
you know and the problems are are

367
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,160
representative there um and they

368
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,240
temporarily modify the sodium

369
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,279
hydroxide level right so applied to

370
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:02,399
manufacturing that's a

371
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,480
big issue especially pharmaceuticals if

372
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,679
you're able to

373
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,720
you know affect that product there i

374
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,240
also provided a link um to

375
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,319
to a reported future interview with a

376
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,000
ransomware group member

377
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,199
and in that they basically asked like

378
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,839
how how the interactions changed with

379
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,439
organizations since the beginning

380
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,400
of the pandemic and the response was

381
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,160
it's definitely changed their crisis is

382
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,120
palpable

383
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,880
um they are not able to pay the same

384
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,160
amounts as before they were talking

385
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,760
about organizations in general and they

386
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,240
said

387
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,760
except for manufacturers of

388
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,840
pharmaceutical products i think is worth

389
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,799
paying more attention

390
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,400
to them they're doing just fine and we

391
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,240
need to help them so it's just something

392
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:42,960
that is a

393
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,640
you know an ongoing threat as you can

394
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,150
see

395
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:49,120
[Music]

396
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,520
we'll go to the next slide which is

397
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,720
slide number

398
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,640
11. in that in the lower right you can

399
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,760
see uh

400
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,200
you know ttp um

401
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,760
in and an ioc and that attack that's

402
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,840
referenced that talks about astrazeneca

403
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,200
there the interesting thing about this

404
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,080
ransomware

405
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,840
intrusion and it was a good write-up by

406
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,840
the dfir uh report

407
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,600
site is from initial access to basically

408
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,080
um

409
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,760
you know encrypting all the main join

410
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,440
systems that's four and a half hours

411
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,559
and that's um that's definitely you know

412
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,240
a challenge from an incident management

413
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,240
perspective when you're talking about

414
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,480
um you know going through the technical

415
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,280
analysis

416
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,600
to starting to sort whether you want to

417
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,840
pay in bitcoin and lining up payments

418
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,120
they were able

419
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,559
um the asking price for that was

420
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,960
up to 400k um in this example here

421
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,440
so we'll go to the next slide which is

422
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,400
slide number

423
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,720
12.

424
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,280
so for that last november of 2020

425
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,960
dragos um published a

426
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,679
rep report an annual trip report there

427
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,600
uh for the manufacturing sector

428
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,039
i shouldn't say it was annual that was

429
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,200
just a manufacturing sector report for

430
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,080
that one

431
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,600
um and it really one of the big

432
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,120
takeaways that i saw is it started to

433
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,280
highlight the growing convergence of

434
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,120
interconnected enterprise um operations

435
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,400
um and what i apply to be like things

436
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,280
like erp

437
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,000
and manufacturing execution systems that

438
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,320
really

439
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,120
bridge that global or that you know that

440
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,080
corporate network

441
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,280
um into um the ics network some of the

442
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:27,600
big

443
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,840
takeaways from that was more passive

444
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,280
monitoring as needed

445
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,160
uh more evaluation of active direct

446
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,520
directory federations

447
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,840
and um and trust relationships are

448
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,600
needed as well as backups especially

449
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,720
identifying

450
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,039
um the crown jewels there um so we'll

451
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,400
talk more about

452
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,520
um you know some of those

453
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,640
systems like erp and manufacturing

454
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,160
execution systems we'll go to the next

455
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,280
slide

456
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,960
which is slide number 14.

457
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,799
um so for that

458
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:04,240
we've got um you know some of those in

459
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,480
between systems especially at level four

460
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,760
level three and applying to the

461
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,520
manufacturing sector

462
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,120
um we've got um enterprise resource

463
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,159
planning systems

464
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:18,080
um and those really you know

465
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,159
plan help to translate a lot of the

466
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,080
production forecasts the requirements

467
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:24,400
for raw material purchases

468
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,080
um you know a lot of the planning

469
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,240
elements into the accounting systems

470
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,520
help calculate costs um

471
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,559
and and really liaison with systems such

472
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,799
as the manufacturing execution systems

473
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,080
and for those

474
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,679
those connect those are good about

475
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,679
connecting you know between

476
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,960
those erp systems and um you know really

477
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,280
the

478
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,760
systems and flows on the shop floor you

479
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,320
know

480
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,200
through controlling those product

481
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,159
recipes

482
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,640
and creating batch records there that

483
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,679
are important for

484
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,720
things like an fda audit here

485
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,720
and linking to the document management

486
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,000
systems and sops

487
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,159
and then you've got laboratory

488
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:05,600
information management systems and for

489
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,640
those so for those

490
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,320
those are doing qc testings of the

491
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,400
product making sure that they

492
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,840
you know meet the right specs there

493
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,880
and track those testing results um as

494
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,720
well and then you've got document

495
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,320
document management systems plant

496
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,240
maintenance systems and

497
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,480
advanced planning and scheduling systems

498
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,280
um

499
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,120
then getting into the ics and ot systems

500
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,000
here to save

501
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,320
time uh from the issues before i'll just

502
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,159
say if you go to the miter

503
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,360
um attack um ics matrix

504
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,000
um and and look at the you know the

505
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,039
systems um

506
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,520
part they'll give a good explanation of

507
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,039
you know all of those elements there

508
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:45,600
again and

509
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,440
all of those do apply to the mark man

510
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,760
i'm sorry a pharmaceutical

511
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,840
enterprise use case so we'll go to the

512
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,960
next slide

513
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:56,159
which is slide number 14.

514
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,840
so in this example here we can see

515
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,440
how um you know the the erp

516
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,679
and the manufacturing execution systems

517
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,200
really are involved

518
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,240
um from everything like um you know the

519
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,640
production schedule to the logistics to

520
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:12,960
where

521
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,080
quality comes into play um and then also

522
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,559
how you've got some of the alerts um

523
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:19,840
that are problematic

524
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,280
such as recent sap netweader

525
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,919
alerts coming access to a good write-up

526
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,200
in

527
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,240
back in april of some of the uh you know

528
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,039
the

529
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,360
the sap issues and there's a lot of

530
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,799
integrations that are happening

531
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,520
um to the cloud with that um that you

532
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,799
know folks need to be

533
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,840
aware of there we'll go to the next

534
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,720
slide

535
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,480
which is slide number 15.

536
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,919
so one of the things that you know i

537
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,200
wanted to get a sense from the previous

538
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,280
slides is you don't have to exploit

539
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,240
ot systems in order to impact ot systems

540
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:56,640
and

541
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,840
a you know cyber attack and some of the

542
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,280
some of what i'm reading initially on

543
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,200
the colonial pipeline in that example

544
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,679
is it it may have been um you know

545
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:06,720
within

546
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,760
you know that zone there um

547
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,159
but you know that's that's just stuff

548
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,200
that i'm hearing

549
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:16,240
loosely on that with the sap cyber

550
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,679
security framework that was an effort

551
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,840
out of eas

552
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,120
sec um and they brought in you know

553
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,080
other

554
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,919
frameworks such as this with that that

555
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,240
was developed in 2017

556
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,520
and presented in black hat

557
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,640
and it was driven by

558
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,080
the lack of effective oversight by

559
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,120
um you know cisos and

560
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,240
uh poor integration there and complexity

561
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,240
yeah a lot of times the erp

562
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,840
administrator is

563
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,840
is part of i.t but often left out of

564
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,279
meetings and um

565
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,360
you know it's it's something that's

566
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,919
that's easy to flow under the radar even

567
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,840
with a business critical system

568
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,360
you know such as that there's even a

569
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,279
linkage in there to sort

570
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,000
opportunities such as the automating the

571
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
continuous gathering of threat data

572
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,400
and applying detection rules to automate

573
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,279
creation of

574
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,960
incidents um to detect those and they

575
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,840
they elaborate on that in those we got

576
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,440
our next

577
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,520
slide which is slide 16. um so

578
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,279
for that um bill

579
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,320
bill ellis of chipotle and

580
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,520
uh and carson zimmerman in the mitre 10

581
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,520
strategies the world-class stock both

582
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,600
both hit the same point which is

583
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,200
do a few things well and that's

584
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,600
especially important for

585
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,400
a um especially a small medium

586
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,000
manufacturer that

587
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,600
you're not going to be able to tackle a

588
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,760
whole big grizzly framework

589
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,440
um yes i i remember you know i tuned

590
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,640
into the

591
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,520
csa talk yesterday and it highlighted

592
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,919
the challenge of really tackling all

593
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,760
those controls at once so

594
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,960
it's important really to you know to

595
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,600
manage expectations and establish

596
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,480
credibility

597
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,320
and protect yourself which is starting

598
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,919
with yo a few things so we'll go to the

599
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:10,960
next slide

600
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,679
um slide 17. you know what are the few

601
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:14,240
that i

602
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,440
would focus on so i would first do a

603
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,080
good job

604
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,840
of figuring out what my critical systems

605
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,840
and my crown jewels are

606
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,720
and you know i will talk about some

607
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,400
strategies to that

608
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,039
i think after you've got an idea of that

609
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,320
what you're protecting what your

610
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:30,880
business

611
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,039
is you know getting into the threat

612
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,480
landscape um

613
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,039
once you have that um understanding your

614
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,159
situational awareness

615
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,799
and you know attack detection capability

616
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,200
um and then incident readiness because

617
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,440
you know in most incidents especially

618
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,159
you know in a low maturity environment

619
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,919
you're really spending a lot of those

620
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,440
first hours if not

621
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,200
days just digging out and figuring out

622
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,559
what the heck the environment

623
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,960
is and what your network looks like in

624
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,200
that example

625
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,480
so we'll go to the next slide which is

626
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,520
slide number 18.

627
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,640
so for a crown jewel analysis i want to

628
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,840
determine what my

629
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,360
you know the critical production

630
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,360
processes are and the system and data

631
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,400
dependencies

632
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,080
especially in the airplane manufacturing

633
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,840
execution system example

634
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,240
um that's that's that's an important

635
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,360
thing to look at i don't know what the

636
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,720
uptime availability is

637
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,279
i want to know what the what certainly

638
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,720
the quality requirements

639
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,279
are um and how those are being managed

640
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:27,760
um

641
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,480
and then you know identify where does

642
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,559
the security operations capability

643
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,880
fit you know are there any any gaps in

644
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,200
the area responsibility the sites that

645
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,600
are covered by the team and resources

646
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,559
um the scope if you've got mssp in parts

647
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,520
and

648
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,000
your really ability to to perform on

649
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,919
security operations procedures in a lot

650
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,159
of cases in a pharmaceutical environment

651
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,559
that can have implications for you know

652
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,400
what your quality regulations

653
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,000
are and it's not always straightforward

654
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,240
it's not like you go

655
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,480
and you ask um a lot of cases that

656
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,240
somebody's got a perfect spreadsheet

657
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,200
and visio diagrams in a lot of cases

658
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,440
there's recent mergers and acquisitions

659
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,240
um there's an inconsistent understanding

660
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,559
of your roles and responsibilities

661
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,200
some of those critical systems um that i

662
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,799
mentioned such as erp

663
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,559
might not be documented well it might be

664
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:20,640
very you know complex there

665
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,640
so that's that's some of the challenges

666
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,159
so what do you do about that we'll go to

667
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:24,880
the next

668
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,000
um slide um

669
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,240
the biggest thing i think is just ask

670
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,120
more than one

671
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,000
person and keep the dialogue going you

672
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:34,399
know

673
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,559
ask for what they have in critical

674
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:37,440
system lists

675
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,880
um don't set unfair expectations

676
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,279
um time box yourself you know to where

677
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,320
you want to

678
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,360
to get the best spat at it um you know

679
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,120
continue to ask those probing questions

680
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,720
ask the ot personnel

681
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,240
what was your worst day forget about

682
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,320
security you know when were you up

683
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:54,799
really

684
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,880
where you going there look if you have a

685
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,960
ticketing system and it could be on the

686
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,399
ito side

687
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,320
you know see what was documented there

688
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,039
for past outages and incidents

689
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:08,320
um another one that i found very useful

690
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,120
is to observe cyber insurance

691
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,039
discussions amongst the executives right

692
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,159
as they're

693
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,399
as they're going through there because

694
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:17,520
you know you can hear

695
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,279
kind of they'll hear the back and forth

696
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,039
and you'll truly glean out

697
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,039
what is important for them to keep the

698
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,720
business running you know especially

699
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,080
with the costs of that

700
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,919
um nowadays look at your um

701
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:32,320
a lot of the ot switches to firewalls

702
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,679
and those configurations

703
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:35,200
i've got a little screenshot of skeleton

704
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,720
switch in the lower right

705
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,279
um that's that's something that you just

706
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,480
go and you

707
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,279
you know pop into you know some of the

708
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,279
vendor lookups and wireshark

709
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,200
you can at least say hey there's a

710
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,039
rockwell device you know what are what

711
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:49,679
are those

712
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,600
and you know just again continue that

713
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,799
dialogue with ot

714
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,840
have um you know site risk assessments

715
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,679
um and and you know if you can

716
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,080
especially you know um

717
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,840
post cover there see if you can go up

718
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,520
there and take a walk and just discuss

719
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,799
that with people

720
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,880
um and most of all at the end just you

721
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,000
know once

722
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,480
once you've got to where you you know

723
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,520
you feel like

724
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,120
you've done you know what you can in

725
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,799
that time box just you know mark the

726
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,159
criteria down

727
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:19,679
um you know and move forward and

728
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,279
continue to disseminate that in those

729
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:22,640
executive

730
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,440
and management and you know those team

731
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,080
conversations

732
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,919
there we'll go to the next slide which

733
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,799
is slide 20.

734
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:34,399
so understand your threat landscape

735
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,000
there again i think you got to have a

736
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,679
little bit of crown jewels to

737
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,000
to get into that um who could be

738
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,760
attacking your organization

739
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,120
you know why how um you know

740
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,320
cert some ideas are to you know monitor

741
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:48,960
the news

742
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,000
monitor things like twitter you know

743
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,080
sans has ics hotcakes

744
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,440
um webcasts recently which is

745
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,919
which i think is awesome to highlight

746
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,080
recent attacks there

747
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,760
and then you know dissect those

748
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,760
intrusions and ttp's affecting your

749
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,200
industry

750
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,520
so you know like the rebel attack that i

751
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,200
brought up earlier

752
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,279
um go through and take each step and

753
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,120
line that up against the miter

754
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:19,120
um you know ics matrix there

755
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,360
um and then you know again don't don't

756
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,559
forget the business side and the

757
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,320
applications there

758
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,000
and then understand the open source

759
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,080
intelligence on your company related to

760
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,840
the ttps

761
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,159
and um you know under the other other

762
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,080
big thing is know your vendors

763
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,559
and your remote access solutions that's

764
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:37,360
another thing that

765
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,799
tends to fly under the radar um

766
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,679
is what your relationships are um you

767
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:44,480
know there

768
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:51,120
so we'll go to the next slide page

769
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,720
so the alien otx they've actually got a

770
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,559
manufacturing industry

771
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:59,840
if you go to into that tab there

772
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,799
so you'll be able to see some some

773
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,279
recent pulses um there

774
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,519
um they've got 20 industries in total so

775
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,720
some of them there's overlap there's a

776
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,080
chemical industry there

777
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:13,440
um so you can check that out um also

778
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,679
sites such as nssp alert prep post

779
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,640
the hacker news dfir report report for

780
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:18,960
good

781
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,080
and to look for manufacturing on related

782
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,640
attacks

783
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,799
and you know there are steps that you

784
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:27,039
can take after that to reduce your

785
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:28,080
threat landscape

786
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,440
you know but for me if i'm just starting

787
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,120
with a few things i just want to know

788
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,440
you know where i'm at to begin what am i

789
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,559
what am i protecting

790
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,760
which which threats there so

791
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,480
we'll go to slide the next one slide

792
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,519
number 22.

793
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,080
so now we're getting into situational

794
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:48,720
awareness

795
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,080
um and attack detection strategies um

796
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,320
and and again you should have you know a

797
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,919
good a good idea of those

798
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,279
you know previous two things that i

799
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,120
talked about um

800
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,039
and i suggest to reach out to the ot

801
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,919
network it ot network teams

802
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,360
um get things like network address um

803
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,360
information and diagrams capture pcap

804
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,279
know what's connected to your ot

805
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:15,039
switches um

806
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,519
and then your baseline your network

807
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,279
traffic kind of good that

808
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,720
so identify the i t ot

809
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,240
flows the relationship to the crown

810
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,919
jewels

811
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,399
and then protocols and use that's how

812
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:29,919
you can you can also

813
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:31,519
you know if you get a vulnerability you

814
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:32,960
can de-escalate things in your

815
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,320
environment pretty quickly

816
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,960
um if you know that that is not um you

817
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,679
know any use

818
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:39,840
in your environment so we'll go to the

819
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,840
next slide page 23.

820
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,600
[Music]

821
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,799
so i like to the next step is

822
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,279
is the baseline and detection capability

823
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:56,080
so take your top maybe two to three

824
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,559
threats if not more but you know at

825
00:32:58,559 --> 00:32:59,679
least a few

826
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,159
and then map those to the miter attack

827
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,000
enterprise and ics

828
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,240
uh matrices there um and

829
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,919
take a look apply the threat you know

830
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:11,840
landscape to your cradles you know and

831
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,640
that

832
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,760
um for each tactic identify the

833
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,080
you know the status of the logging you

834
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,640
know how long are you keeping those logs

835
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,919
um where could they be rotated off to

836
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:26,399
ability to detect the activity at the

837
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,159
network and the host level

838
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,200
and then who and how or ot

839
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,279
or security operations um currently

840
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:35,279
monitoring related activity

841
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,519
do you have any mssps involved or even

842
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,480
site you know

843
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,760
site resources involved and um

844
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,240
what i would suggest to do is you know

845
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,200
things like a check

846
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,440
or an x you know for both logging and

847
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,799
detection or

848
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,080
um a stoplight you know for that um

849
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,559
and then maintain that as a reference um

850
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:55,760
for future

851
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:58,960
exercises both to be aware um and see

852
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,960
you know see how you're improving we'll

853
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,880
go to the next slide

854
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,159
number 24.

855
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:09,280
um so for the next one um i think it's

856
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,879
good to perform

857
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,839
uh regular um asset identification you

858
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:14,399
know

859
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:16,560
especially after you know after you get

860
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,918
that initial baseline

861
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,639
um you know continue to do that

862
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,879
configuration file analysis

863
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,079
um and even eventually um physical

864
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,320
uh physical instead inspection it's a

865
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,280
lot easier

866
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,639
to to do the traffic analysis than it is

867
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,359
um to you know to actually to walk up

868
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:37,280
and do that so i would do that part

869
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,560
um less frequently um seek design

870
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,000
um opportunities so in sight

871
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,839
like you know site acceptance and

872
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:47,839
factory um

873
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,320
acceptance that's a good time to try to

874
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,839
fund and position

875
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,679
you know things like sensors and live

876
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,679
collection and solutions

877
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:59,040
um you know and that and that stuff um

878
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,680
you know especially in manufacturing

879
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,760
pharmaceuticals it's frequent for

880
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,240
um new plants to be you know built to

881
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:06,800
support

882
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,119
um different products on there that come

883
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:09,839
online

884
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,920
um and building a refined logging and

885
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,599
detection strategy

886
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,839
um have a consistent use case framework

887
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:16,720
i found that the blue

888
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:19,760
team um handbook is a good start um

889
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,880
and then applying the miter attack ics

890
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,320
um side to that um seek opportunities

891
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:26,880
for

892
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,040
store and automation especially the

893
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,480
combat

894
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,040
alert fatigue and in the last month on

895
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,880
the nsa published a

896
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,440
um stop malicious cyber activity against

897
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,480
ot

898
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,520
technology recommendation

899
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,960
document and for that that includes um

900
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,640
logging all the access attempts

901
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:48,720
including vendor or outsourced

902
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,359
on ot asset support identifying known

903
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,400
and unknown

904
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:55,200
remote access attempts um through

905
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,960
creating those baselines um they've got

906
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,640
a few there you know again knowing what

907
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,000
your environment looks like

908
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,599
on a good day so go to slide

909
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,079
25

910
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,400
so some opportunities i saw i i've seen

911
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,079
for soar i haven't

912
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,160
i haven't seen it myself implemented you

913
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,280
know in

914
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:19,680
you know at the wire or the purdue

915
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,960
0-2 0-2 level there

916
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,240
but you know for me i think you want to

917
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,240
really take as much pressure off of that

918
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,599
security team

919
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,119
as possible where you can um so a lot of

920
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,800
manufacturers have now productivity

921
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:35,520
environments

922
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,520
and things like o365 so if you can

923
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,599
you know if you can have them focus

924
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,280
truly on a crown jewels

925
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,520
as much as possible given the fact that

926
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,320
you know fishing

927
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,599
is you know a initial access sector

928
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,960
um that that would be uh you know a

929
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,400
positive thing so

930
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
some examples are you know those

931
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,839
phishing

932
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,680
events and even the case management

933
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,599
translating that into ticketing

934
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:05,680
um perimeter ids blocking um correlation

935
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,079
in between the business network remote

936
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,839
access and the manufacturing remote

937
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:10,800
access

938
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,960
and then maybe you see a new internet

939
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,960
connection in the ot environment we'll

940
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,680
kind of have a look at a potential tool

941
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,960
there on that side

942
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,240
the acsc published a remote access to ot

943
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:22,800
document

944
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,079
i thought that there's some use cases to

945
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,839
glean um in that

946
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,400
um that was in the past year uh

947
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,440
generally the left

948
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,599
edge of the miter attack ics framework

949
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:32,960
again is kind of where those

950
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,640
opportunities are

951
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:37,760
and um and i see ot

952
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,280
network security monitoring tools

953
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,040
integrating with sim and firewalls more

954
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,240
and more

955
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,240
so we'll go to the next slide

956
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,310
[Music]

957
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,760
so i i think you know getting started

958
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,960
testing some of this

959
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,000
they've got a porous ics um

960
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,440
conference back in 2015 at polish pcaps

961
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,640
of a laboratory environment so

962
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,880
that could be cool to grab that pcap and

963
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,480
whether you're using open source

964
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,920
like wireshark or grass marlin

965
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:11,440
or a commercial tool um you can

966
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,640
go ahead and give that peak at the start

967
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,560
um for me you know i i've leveraged that

968
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,760
um uh and then for ot

969
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,880
for ot switches there um try and you

970
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,280
know get

971
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,640
grab a pcap on that side hold that um

972
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,040
again that can also serve as a baseline

973
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,640
you know and cumulatively

974
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,000
you know across the tools especially if

975
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,520
you're on the open source side it might

976
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,160
take

977
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,000
you know more than one to achieve all of

978
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,200
these but look for assets on the network

979
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,640
um look to visualize those connections

980
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,760
um especially in ics space um

981
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,760
you won't see new assets pop up for

982
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,079
those even um that become

983
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,720
inactive as frequent so you can trigger

984
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,000
on those

985
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,599
um and then you know and looked at

986
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,079
and continue that dialogue um with your

987
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,440
ot pocs

988
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,400
with that so go to the next slide um

989
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,240
we're going to look at some examples so

990
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:10,240
this is a commercial tool

991
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,079
and you can see it's a dashboard it

992
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:15,440
shows assets nodes protocols and alerts

993
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,000
um both at the ot the it and the ot

994
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,880
level

995
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,760
um again you know a lot of these can be

996
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:22,880
accomplished with

997
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,520
a combination of open source tools um as

998
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,160
well

999
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,760
you know so a use case that we'll look

1000
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,160
at here is a new asset

1001
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,520
potentially coming in we'll go to the

1002
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:35,119
next slide and you'll see

1003
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,720
you know a new address you know from an

1004
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,160
asset is appeared

1005
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:42,160
on the network there um and you can

1006
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,359
you know you can click on that and then

1007
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:46,960
going into the next slide

1008
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,000
you know in tools you would want to go

1009
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,520
you know and see hey what type of

1010
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,359
protocols are going back and forth with

1011
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:54,240
that

1012
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:58,160
um to even you know details um

1013
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,040
you know on on hardware components um

1014
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,160
and mac addresses

1015
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,160
um if you can you know if you can get

1016
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:06,319
that

1017
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,200
so we'll go to the next slide which is

1018
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,160
slide number 30.

1019
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:15,440
um so so for this for your incident

1020
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,520
uh response capability you want to

1021
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,800
tailor it for those

1022
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,800
regulatory contractual and legal

1023
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,480
requirements i mentioned before

1024
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,920
that a lot like your sops um

1025
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,400
generically they might not be um you

1026
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,720
know compatible with your quality

1027
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,520
requirements there um you know consider

1028
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,880
involvement

1029
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,599
from labor unions government and vendors

1030
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:38,319
there

1031
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:41,280
i i always think it's a good idea um to

1032
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:41,760
include

1033
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,599
the vendors on developing the incident

1034
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:44,800
response plan

1035
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,520
um consider legacy and unique systems

1036
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,000
and

1037
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,640
what you would do to you know to tackle

1038
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,079
issues with those

1039
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:55,839
um plan for the you know realistic mid

1040
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:57,680
incident data collection

1041
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:00,240
um and forensics uh as i put it's always

1042
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:00,800
a challenge

1043
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,520
not only with ot but at it you know when

1044
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,680
you're in the throes of it to

1045
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,599
you know to really exchange forensic

1046
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,960
information for the first time

1047
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:11,520
so consider that with your incident

1048
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,480
response

1049
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,160
planning and we'll get to kind of some

1050
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,839
strategies related to that

1051
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,480
um establish a proper incident

1052
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,640
management um hierarchy

1053
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,160
um which is a part of that is

1054
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,920
integrating the otir

1055
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,800
processes with the iit side you know and

1056
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,359
that

1057
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:29,920
in the colonial example i heard that

1058
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,119
there was

1059
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,040
um you know five million dollars that

1060
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,319
was paid out um

1061
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,480
in bitcoin um so you know you'll have to

1062
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,079
go back to your finance and your

1063
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,280
accounting team

1064
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,800
you know for that um you know down to

1065
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,520
uh you know you're the you know the ot

1066
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,359
engineers on the ground

1067
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:50,319
um to rectify the situation there so

1068
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:51,920
coordination is key

1069
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,720
um consider out-of-band communication um

1070
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,160
protocols there

1071
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,400
right so maybe getting something like a

1072
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,480
zoom you know or a slack

1073
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,040
you know on license um in case your

1074
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:03,760
network

1075
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,119
is suspect to handle that and then

1076
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:10,400
you know things like ics4 ics

1077
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,680
2.0 i put in the link for linkedin

1078
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,640
is an effort that came out of s4 on a

1079
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,040
few

1080
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,599
but you know a few iterations back um to

1081
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:21,440
try and solve some of the incident

1082
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,119
management challenges so go check that

1083
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:25,359
out

1084
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:29,680
so we'll go to the next slide slide 31.

1085
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:32,319
i'm so for that you know again you know

1086
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,240
you got the best plan on paper

1087
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,960
the best analyst the best management but

1088
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:37,839
um

1089
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:39,920
you know you'll still feel challenged

1090
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,200
you know it's about

1091
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,839
you know exercising it and you know and

1092
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,200
really figuring out what folks

1093
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,560
personalities are

1094
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,720
um you know when you know when the

1095
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,839
challenge comes so

1096
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:52,800
i tend to like to look at uh some of the

1097
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:53,440
the youtube

1098
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,760
channel for tim kennedy and cheap dog

1099
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,200
response you know which is

1100
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,280
train like you fight um the more you

1101
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,040
sweat the less you believe there and so

1102
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:01,599
on right

1103
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:03,760
the moral of the story is you know

1104
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,640
really

1105
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,920
you know really test your instant

1106
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,560
response processes out um

1107
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,560
you know and get a feel for how you

1108
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:12,160
would handle you know some of the

1109
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,440
threats that you see

1110
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,760
um you know early on and really you know

1111
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,760
how are you doing with situational

1112
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,440
awareness and those threats how fast

1113
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,760
being pieced together in the environment

1114
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,880
and the architecture there so we'll go

1115
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,400
to the next slide which is slide number

1116
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,720
32.

1117
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:32,240
so for that develop you know

1118
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,079
i like to develop some scenarios aligned

1119
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,319
to those threat landscapes generically

1120
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:38,560
you know i think that erp manufacturing

1121
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,000
execution system compromise

1122
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,240
is a good one you know to start i won't

1123
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:43,920
read through all these here

1124
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,520
but going to to ics historian financial

1125
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:48,880
compromise that's

1126
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:51,040
in the pharmaceutical example historians

1127
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,240
are are

1128
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,640
very important there um to even like

1129
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,599
de-escalating

1130
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,359
an exercise right so what happens if you

1131
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:58,880
just get a generic

1132
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,079
malware event um on a laboratory

1133
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,760
information management system

1134
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,359
everybody comes in there at 10 o'clock

1135
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,280
in the morning you know for a tabletop

1136
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,640
in that example they're expecting

1137
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,440
something big

1138
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,079
what if it what if you choose to um

1139
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,359
de-escalate it there

1140
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,319
i think that's a good tactic and then

1141
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:17,440
consider

1142
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,640
um you know the threat and environment

1143
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:23,119
considerations there you know such as

1144
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,800
you know improper handling

1145
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,880
and some of the you know some of the

1146
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,319
optics challenges

1147
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:31,680
um that could occur um and again it

1148
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,960
doesn't have to always be

1149
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,000
everybody and everything at once um

1150
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,800
you know in that 10 o'clock example um a

1151
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,640
lot of times folks will try and schedule

1152
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,599
a tabletop

1153
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,160
on you know let's just say on like

1154
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:45,440
tomorrow on a friday

1155
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:48,480
and certain management or um you know

1156
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,160
engineers won't be there right

1157
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,599
that's the perfect time because

1158
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,599
incidents normally happen at

1159
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,359
one or two o'clock in the morning when

1160
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,640
people are on vacation

1161
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,560
and not you know in the middle of the

1162
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:00,400
day um

1163
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,240
so part of that is simulating those

1164
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,440
organizational

1165
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,520
anomalies you know what happens if

1166
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,880
you're working at your

1167
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:09,280
your virtual you know in your zoom

1168
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,119
besides they glitch out like this right

1169
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:12,079
here

1170
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:13,440
how do you handle that you know what are

1171
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,760
your protocols um

1172
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,760
some examples of the scenarios are

1173
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,319
listed on the right you know sans had a

1174
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:20,880
talk

1175
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:23,440
and a few things came out of that um

1176
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,160
singapore

1177
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:26,480
university of technology and i trust um

1178
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,119
had a great scenario in that and

1179
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:33,200
um the sans program maturity quick start

1180
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,880
guide also lists some

1181
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,960
good table top examples in that so we'll

1182
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,599
go to the next slide putting it together

1183
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:42,000
um and then the one after that which is

1184
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,720
sock cnn

1185
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:47,680
so socksian was developed by rob thanos

1186
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,319
um

1187
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:51,359
it's um a tool um that i've seen used a

1188
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:52,079
lot

1189
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:55,280
on the sock side to um to analyze

1190
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,000
maturity

1191
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,200
it's based on cmmi um it has the ability

1192
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:00,160
to be customized

1193
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,240
especially in the advanced model um

1194
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,240
which i use and has mappings in this

1195
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:06,560
than this cyber security framework

1196
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:09,359
so for that um that's where when i had

1197
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:10,160
that grizzly

1198
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,200
ecosystem slide earlier on um

1199
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:15,280
it's it's useful to go and map back to

1200
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,040
that to make sure that you're

1201
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:18,640
you're measuring things in a standard

1202
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,400
way we'll go to the next slide which is

1203
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,319
slide number 35

1204
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:23,839
might need to wrap it up pretty quick

1205
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:26,319
there carl and we'll get to it yep so

1206
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:27,520
these are the top dozen

1207
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,920
that i have uh mapped to the miss cyber

1208
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:31,680
security framework you know from this

1209
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,480
talk

1210
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:36,720
uh next slide slide 36 um side

1211
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:39,200
this gets into how i customized on the

1212
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,520
sock cnn tool and i will publish that on

1213
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,040
the stock cnn

1214
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,760
forum there at that link after this talk

1215
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,920
um basically what i did is i took all

1216
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,640
of the elements from the previous um

1217
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,319
slide that i could i marked those

1218
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:55,119
um to critical and you can see that this

1219
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:57,040
cyber security framework mapping in the

1220
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,000
remarks column

1221
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:01,040
we will go to slide 37 um

1222
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:02,800
and what you can do is mainly mark out

1223
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,240
on the left where you want to achieve

1224
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,680
for each of

1225
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:08,800
um you know each of the framework

1226
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,920
um you know areas and then you'll see in

1227
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:12,480
the tool

1228
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,480
as you get into the tab for the cyber

1229
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:17,040
security security framework 1.1

1230
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,160
um where that maps to it so for that

1231
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,839
that is the end of my talk i really

1232
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,520
apologize to everyone for

1233
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,920
the audio visual issues and the blinking

1234
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,280
here and so on

1235
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:30,559
um but hopefully you'll be able to

1236
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,160
get these slides to serve as reference

1237
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,920
and go back and check it out and again i

1238
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,839
encourage you to check out

1239
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:38,480
this tool that i post to the sock cnn

1240
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:38,960
forum

1241
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,359
in the coming days yeah cool thank you

1242
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:46,559
thank you so much kyle so yeah i think

1243
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:48,000
we all can appreciate the

1244
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:50,400
difficulties of zoom and working from

1245
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,520
home and all that so

1246
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:54,079
but very very well done to uh quickly

1247
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:54,960
jump onto it

1248
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:56,720
unfortunately we don't have any time for

1249
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,880
questions but i'm sure if there are any

1250
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,520
they'll

1251
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:01,040
uh people will reach out and there's a

1252
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:04,640
few a few nods in the audience here so

1253
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,400
without uh we might have to go straight

1254
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:07,920
into the next speaker so thank you very

1255
