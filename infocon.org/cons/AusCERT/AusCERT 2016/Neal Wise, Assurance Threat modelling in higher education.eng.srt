1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:10,260
good morning welcome to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the last day of</font>

2
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:13,469
ulster 2016 we have three presentations

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,059
this morning each 40 minutes long if

4
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:18,180
there's times for questions we'll just

5
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:20,189
throw them to the floor our first

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,619
presenter this morning and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Neil Weiss</font>

7
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:25,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">Neil is a director at assurance in</font>

8
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:27,230
Melbourne his presentation is titled

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:35,839
threat modeling in higher education

10
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:39,019
please welcome Neil to the stage hello

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:43,890
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure everybody's feeling today</font>

12
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:47,640
I'm pretty nervous so here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> go so yeah</font>

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:49,320
I'm Neil I've presented to assert a

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,059
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> times over the years mainly on</font>

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,710
wireless and mobility and infrastructure

16
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:57,839
stuff and I work as a as a security

17
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:02,969
tester basically and a lot of the work

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,559
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we do is around our education they</font>

19
00:01:02,969 --> 00:01:07,549
make a quick adjustment to something

20
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,548
here so I can read my notes

21
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:15,530
ok

22
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,100
ok

23
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:35,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">he really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> helpful if this is move right</font>

24
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:39,370
ok ok I'm anybody ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> go out in the war</font>

25
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:41,170
driving with us at assert like we wait

26
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:46,030
for many years we ran a wireless audit

27
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:48,460
tutorial and we assert got a coach

28
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:49,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">forced one year then after that it just</font>

29
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,880
became a thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we always</font>

30
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:54,040
incorporated into our or where else

31
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,390
testing our wireless training here just

32
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:57,400
because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> fun</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to spend the</font>

33
00:01:55,390 --> 00:02:00,789
day learning about hacking wireless and

34
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:04,810
then go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and not hack people but get</font>

35
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:06,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do the field research that ok so I'm</font>

36
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:08,259
what we're going to go over today is I'm

37
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:10,360
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to quickly cover sort of</font>

38
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:12,690
differences between the way I see it as

39
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:15,040
an attacker and someone who looks at

40
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:18,790
enterprises in higher education networks

41
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,920
as targets and I wanted want to sort of

42
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,329
go through a bit of the the what I see

43
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:26,109
is that the commonality and the

44
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:30,280
differences<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the networks as well yeah</font>

45
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:32,320
so we'll go on to this first and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

46
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:37,239
a pretty poor representation of your

47
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:39,790
typical enterprise network we have a you

48
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:41,320
know the usual<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of DMZ type scenario</font>

49
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,720
that we might deliver public service out

50
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,989
of this is very classic enterprise

51
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:50,739
network no sass cloud sort of stuff no

52
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:52,780
mobility no BYOD no but basically have a

53
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:54,730
number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of key services that we leverage</font>

54
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,280
in order to provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> remote access in the</font>

55
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:59,980
network to support controls at the

56
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">gateway and we may have some controls at</font>

57
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,950
other parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network I think of</font>

58
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:04,540
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little generous like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> assigned</font>

59
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,130
like for a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> enterprises putting it</font>

60
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:08,500
into the routing switching middle but

61
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:11,019
many do and then certainly endpoint

62
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:14,140
security we have multiple locations that

63
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:17,769
we have to operate in and when we go to

64
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:20,018
actually I guess push traffic around

65
00:03:17,769 --> 00:03:21,820
networks we cross over different zones

66
00:03:20,019 --> 00:03:24,070
of the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we you know would</font>

67
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:27,489
probably associate with different<font color="#CCCCCC"> levels</font>

68
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:28,600
of privilege or trust and so you know

69
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:31,000
things come in for the big bad internet

70
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:34,150
and then into our DMZ and that's you

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,680
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> such ish and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then you know we have</font>

72
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:37,180
communication within our internal

73
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,400
networks and into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DMZ announce the</font>

74
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:41,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet as well for all our internal</font>

75
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:45,410
clients and internal services

76
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:47,420
so you know in reality it's it's

77
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:49,840
certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like like we have a</font>

78
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:54,079
highly<font color="#E5E5E5"> redundant like multi-site</font>

79
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:55,880
deployments for enterprise having this

80
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,090
this kind of scenario we have traffic

81
00:03:55,880 --> 00:04:00,769
that passes through our environments in

82
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,709
these little ways and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's generally</font>

83
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:06,440
reinforced by the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network the clients in</font>

84
00:04:03,709 --> 00:04:08,660
enterprise networks are generally manage

85
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,670
client<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're under the management the</font>

86
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,290
organization so you'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bad</font>

87
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:14,149
whatever state they are is something

88
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:18,649
that there's there's some opportunity to

89
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:21,798
consistently apply and control but in in

90
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:26,000
higher education a large<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of the</font>

91
00:04:21,798 --> 00:04:27,380
the clients in the network or our does

92
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,720
it belong to students that belong to

93
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,820
other people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just people's</font>

94
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,400
personal devices and so they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

95
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:37,520
higher education<font color="#CCCCCC"> Xin doing BYOD like</font>

96
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,669
long before<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was a big push in</font>

97
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,960
mobility so the other thing about and

98
00:04:40,669 --> 00:04:43,520
this is something for me that I find a

99
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:45,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of fun with higher education</font>

100
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,440
networks and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> I know there's a number</font>

101
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">people in the room who work in and see</font>

102
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,840
somebody have specifically in security

103
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,430
in higher education but i know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font>

104
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">number of people work in networking in</font>

105
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:58,430
higher education<font color="#E5E5E5"> they think is fun for</font>

106
00:04:55,790 --> 00:05:00,680
me is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the size of the networks and the</font>

107
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:03,110
capacity<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the networks that we have</font>

108
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:04,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">clients who have you know 200,000 you</font>

109
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:08,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">know public addresses because they have</font>

110
00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:10,909
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a huge number of class</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pays and</font>

111
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:12,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">that or they have you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know 20 gig</font>

112
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:15,110
gateways and 40 gig network cores like

113
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:17,510
that's that's pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> amazing stuff and</font>

114
00:05:15,110 --> 00:05:19,340
it's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of in enterprises you</font>

115
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:21,860
don't tend to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that either because</font>

116
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:23,630
problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> are broken down because of the</font>

117
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,580
distribution<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people and services or</font>

118
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:28,070
when people need that kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> capacity</font>

119
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:29,990
especially facing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet it's</font>

120
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:32,300
hosted generally and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

121
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,530
some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of internet-based business</font>

122
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:35,780
that needs to have that capacity

123
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:37,750
directly into their environments it's

124
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:39,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that for us is a is</font>

125
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,660
interesting and fun<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's part of the</font>

126
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:44,539
the giant challenge for people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who work</font>

127
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:50,300
in trying to manage and<font color="#CCCCCC"> control these</font>

128
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:52,430
networks so we look at controls on on

129
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:55,090
these these sort of environments and

130
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:57,310
this is this is a really simplified

131
00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:00,460
view of things and in fact it's mostly

132
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:02,050
not the sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of scale and clustering and</font>

133
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:04,599
type redundancy that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would have in</font>

134
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:07,810
in higher education but it's really just

135
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of make a couple of points so</font>

136
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,530
similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what we have an enterprise</font>

137
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:13,810
networks we have no traffic that comes

138
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:16,059
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the internet we have a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

139
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:18,610
different control points that I'll talk

140
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:21,669
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit later as well but</font>

141
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:23,500
there's generally some kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a border</font>

142
00:06:21,669 --> 00:06:25,120
inspection and control environment

143
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,139
that's usually some combination of

144
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:33,700
access control lists on routers and

145
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:35,020
border firewall systems that are usually

146
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,580
configured in ways that we don't sort of

147
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,380
run them in the enterprise they tend to

148
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,570

of a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> University services that</font>

156
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:00,639
there's a data center that's very much

157
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,740
like any other enterprise data center

158
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:04,240
I've kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of represented here is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

159
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:06,610
sort of tiered model but the reality is

160
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,950
that far wall sits on the side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that</font>

161
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:12,190
and all those are spokes off of that far

162
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:13,539
wall and that's how these different

163
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,400
parts of these applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

to services at a university or from the

see a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> networks as so</font>

organizing universities and I'm kind of

174
00:07:32,979 --> 00:07:39,010
coming up with a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a an average of</font>

175
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:40,750
everything that we see but one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

176
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:42,940
other challenges and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

177
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,919
going to war the way the networks were

178
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,660
more traditionally is that there still

179
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:51,190
are a huge number of services<font color="#E5E5E5"> that run</font>

180
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:52,419
out of the private networks sorry out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

181
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:53,979
that the faculty networks that sit

182
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:56,229
within what I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> referred to as the</font>

183
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:59,620
general internal network but it tends to

184
00:07:56,229 --> 00:08:04,090
be segmented networks not so much

185
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:05,979
segregated but there's third parties

186
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:07,989
like affiliates that are connected the

00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:08,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">university certainly fact certain</font>

188
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,959
faculty

189
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:12,099
the University will<font color="#E5E5E5"> run their own</font>

190
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:13,329
services and going further back in

191
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:15,369
history ran a lot more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their own</font>

192
00:08:13,329 --> 00:08:17,139
services so this generally been a push

193
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:20,189
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to centralize especially</font>

194
00:08:17,139 --> 00:08:22,649
commodity services into the central IT

195
00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:24,729
functions the<font color="#E5E5E5"> University in order to</font>

196
00:08:22,649 --> 00:08:27,429
permit you know consistent application

197
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:30,399
of controls permit consistent inspection

198
00:08:27,429 --> 00:08:32,468
and it's you know generally not

199
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:34,058
necessarily what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Department</font>

200
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:37,269
engineering does is to run a mail server

201
00:08:34,058 --> 00:08:38,799
so but it's it's for us it's interesting

202
00:08:37,269 --> 00:08:41,229
cuz we get to see the sort of turf wars

203
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:43,088
of this history play out because um

204
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:45,009
there's a lot of holdouts there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

205
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:47,110
of exceptions in the networks that

206
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:48,759
there's a lot of you know everything

207
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:51,009
must be done this way except for<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font>

208
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:53,139
guys to get to do whatever they want or

209
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:54,819
so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of that and it's it's</font>

210
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:57,100
which is really being a little mean but

211
00:08:54,819 --> 00:08:58,870
as an attacker I don't care<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

212
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:00,879
politics of that I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> care about how</font>

213
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,829
any of those decisions are<font color="#E5E5E5"> made I just</font>

214
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:04,600
see easy targets so that's something

215
00:09:02,829 --> 00:09:07,479
that for me that we look at a

216
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:10,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">differently than that so for us one of</font>

217
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:11,499
the concerns is that there's large parts

218
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:13,149
of the general networks and there's

219
00:09:11,499 --> 00:09:14,889
there's huge efforts in a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

220
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:16,389
organizations that we work with to

221
00:09:14,889 --> 00:09:20,829
reorganize the internal network to

222
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:22,540
introduce segmentation trying to find

223
00:09:20,829 --> 00:09:24,250
ways to identify all the information

224
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:27,250
assets and do classification and make

225
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,600
control decisions based on that so we

226
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:31,509
it's interesting for us to get to see

227
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:33,309
progress in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I will usually</font>

228
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:36,040
have a first exercise with someone and

229
00:09:33,309 --> 00:09:37,600
just loot the entire place and then it

230
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,529
turns into later this process of

231
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,579
building and building and building

232
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:46,209
things so it's a something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for us</font>

233
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:47,620
is is interesting now<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will talk a bit</font>

234
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:49,959
about these<font color="#CCCCCC"> little yellow lines are a</font>

235
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:53,110
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit but um like I should probably</font>

236
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:56,378
<font color="#E5E5E5">just keep moving on um yeah this is</font>

237
00:09:53,110 --> 00:10:02,519
other networks as well that let's see

238
00:09:56,379 --> 00:10:02,519
dude i<font color="#CCCCCC"> just know didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay um</font>

239
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:09,030
there's this<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of an out-of-band</font>

240
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:12,840
management network switch networks in

241
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:14,520
some cases they have subnets that aren't

242
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:17,000
routed but they're widely distributed

243
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,020
layer to network or within a location

244
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,350
what it tends to be is you have a lot of

245
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:23,670
infrastructure that will be connected on

246
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:26,970
management ports<font color="#CCCCCC"> and devices connected</font>

247
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:29,189
to this network as an attacker what we

248
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:31,680
try to do is reach one of those devices

249
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:34,430
and then just Traverse you're out of

250
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">band network because it's a network so</font>

251
00:10:34,430 --> 00:10:40,469
where we see devices haven't had

252
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:42,270
defensive access lists put in to prevent

253
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:44,550
other devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the same management</font>

254
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:47,850
network from being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to reach it then</font>

255
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:49,370
we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the potential of getting to</font>

256
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,630
manage interfaces and may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

257
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:53,160
brute force things or luck into a

258
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:56,850
default or something like that at that

259
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,439
point but it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is a</font>

260
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,970
challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us there is a lot of use</font>

261
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,380
of host based controls like<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

262
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:06,960
network controls aren't practical or

263
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:08,760
just for defense in depth we do see a

264
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of host based controls but they tend</font>

265
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:13,319
to be obviously technology-specific so

266
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:16,440
in one team or another or another and

267
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,420
they're pretty static because they're

268
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">just there they're just generally like</font>

269
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:24,329
the case of<font color="#E5E5E5"> unix systems they would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

270
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:26,340
be generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> a text description of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hosts</font>

271
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:28,080
to trust for different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> so those</font>

272
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:30,270
tied into configuration management and

273
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:31,500
tied into sort of smart management of

274
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:33,780
those hosts will allow you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> distribute</font>

275
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">and create a kind of distributed local</font>

276
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:39,449
firewall for those systems but we see a

277
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,800
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that and sometimes when we are</font>

278
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,720
actually looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the configuration</font>

279
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,949
for it we can you know as an attacker if

280
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,230
we get<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> assistant through some other</font>

281
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,520
means we use that find other things

282
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:48,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">because it says what systems are</font>

283
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:50,490
important and what systems should be

284
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:57,060
trusted and it may tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us where we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

285
00:11:50,490 --> 00:12:01,230
to be in the network so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

286
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:05,760
assets like in in higher education there

are in that that's previous drawing very

down in here<font color="#CCCCCC"> and these in the corner</font>

289

enterprise data<font color="#CCCCCC"> or the business data of</font>

295
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:32,620
the entity just like any<font color="#CCCCCC"> Enterprise you</font>

296
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:34,660
know we there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this sort of common</font>

297
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:39,070
sort of configuration data for the

298
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:42,790
environment but<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what we're</font>

299
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:43,990
looking at that's a university there's

300
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:46,900
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of key applications</font>

301
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:48,790
that we will typically see in a

302
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,420
university as<font color="#CCCCCC"> their kind of enterprise</font>

303
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:55,120
applications and nearly<font color="#CCCCCC"> every</font>

304
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:57,099
institution in the world who's an

305
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,310
educational institution<font color="#CCCCCC"> has these cut a</font>

306
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:04,630
common core systems the<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems have</font>

307
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:06,939
this magic integration which I'm kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

308
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:10,900
being flip here with drawing this the

309
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:15,460
stupid star but it's um it's it's

310
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:19,240
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess probably looks a</font>

311
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:21,580
little more we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into it actually</font>

312
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:28,330
just second so it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> point it</font>

313
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:29,800
down here take the picture yeah so one

314
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,740
thing about these as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as these are</font>

315
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,510
all huge solutions they're all

316
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:39,370
multi-tiered solutions they all have dev

317
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:41,680
prod and test instances and even more

318
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:46,080
like so every one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these probably</font>

319
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:49,030
represents you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 23 24 25 26 seven</font>

320
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:52,180
environments for these that internal or

321
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:53,650
contain layers of tiered application

322
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:55,900
components for the most part look this

323
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:57,790
sums that flattened the tears but so

324
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,650
that's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of infrastructure to</font>

325
00:13:57,790 --> 00:14:00,849
support that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sitting under a lot of</font>

326
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:03,310
that of course these days a lot of

327
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:07,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">virtualization and the the issues</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

328
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:11,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">particularly access to that and become</font>

329
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:13,540
pretty key for it as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I'm just</font>

330
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,989
like an enterprise security activities

331
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:18,939
in higher education you know there's

332
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:22,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's audit risk functions there's QT</font>

333
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:24,310
operations engineering we always<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

334
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,689
about the inverted threat model because

335
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:26,099
of the resident threat because this

336
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:29,759
litter

337
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:33,120
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> living on campus and and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who what</font>

338
00:14:29,759 --> 00:14:35,370
who acted uni<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright maybe it's just me</font>

339
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:40,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see some some some nods so I'm</font>

340
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:42,360
yeah so it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that uh there's a</font>

341
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,769
lot of a lot of talk if you have a lot

342
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:49,230
of time in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands and if man if I</font>

343
00:14:43,769 --> 00:14:51,120
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> access to to 20 gigs of transit at</font>

344
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:54,779
uni I would not have finished uni I know

345
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:56,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">that so um but yeah so there's also</font>

346
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:58,769
other challenges of course to manage

347
00:14:56,699 --> 00:15:02,819
their there is a big push like in any

348
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:06,660
industry to leverage the changes in

349
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:09,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology so like software service is</font>

350
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:13,050
certainly a an attractive thing for<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

351
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,730
education there's certain commodity type

352
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:18,529
applications like student staff email

353
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:21,720
that as migrated and with that comes

354
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:23,730
integration with identity at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the at the</font>

355
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,120
institution and managing the controls

356
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:30,839
run on that is the same applies to with

357
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,939
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of other enterprise applications</font>

358
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:35,399
like we've we've seen a lot of hor

359
00:15:32,939 --> 00:15:36,779
applications shift there's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

360
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:39,120
cloud learning management systems for

361
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:41,430
quite a while but it's it's interesting

362
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,009
times for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this as well because we're</font>

363
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:46,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">taking a somewhat porous network and</font>

364
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:49,860
we're extending trust and controls from

365
00:15:46,589 --> 00:15:52,230
it into someone else's somewhat porous

366
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:54,329
network and as a guy who's

367
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:57,480
professionally paranoid it makes me

368
00:15:54,329 --> 00:16:01,920
really nervous so to me I sort of look

369
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:04,199
at it is a lot like this and what I'll

370
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,990
tell a story a little bit about multi

371
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:12,209
tented SAS solutions and higher

372
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:13,800
education but so actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking into</font>

373
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:16,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">threats knees like I'm going to quickly</font>

374
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:19,560
go through this just because I want to

375
00:16:16,189 --> 00:16:23,699
probably move on to the other parts of

376
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:26,489
the of my talk but um this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

377
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:28,500
i don't do near enough i rely a lot on

378
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:30,449
what i refer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like hackers</font>

379
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:32,220
intuition or something like that it's

380
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:34,290
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience you know when you're</font>

381
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:36,569
working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> something and it just seems</font>

382
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:38,870
junkie and bad and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> found out you're</font>

383
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:41,569
right it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and it's just</font>

384
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:43,790
that so but that can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> own a</font>

385
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:47,270
guide and having a consistent repeatable

386
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:50,260
approach to determining of threats and

387
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:54,410
or anything is obviously important so

388
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:58,610
for me this is this is my<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning</font>

389
00:16:54,410 --> 00:17:01,069
exercise right now is to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to take</font>

390
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:03,410
advantage of logical processes rather

391
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:07,010
than just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and and smashing the</font>

392
00:17:03,410 --> 00:17:08,720
shiny objects so but um so I guess

393
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:12,069
moving into this I wanted to show you

394
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:15,050
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a simple iterative model for this</font>

395
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:17,750
and this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft has done a</font>

396
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:21,790
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work in this space and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it</font>

397
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:27,949
shows like we<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started in pen testing</font>

398
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:30,170
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a like 2000 2001 2002 and we</font>

399
00:17:27,949 --> 00:17:32,870
every everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we did was about</font>

400
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:36,350
exploiting like weaknesses generally in

401
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:38,570
Windows 2000 and it was just easy easy

402
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,678
easy and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> disc Ewing windows</font>

403
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:42,678
initiative and a whole bunch of other

404
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,390
Microsoft programs really drastically

405
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:48,050
improved their security like they no

406
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:49,580
longer became that the know that the top

407
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:53,809
you know vulnerabilities for the year

408
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:56,360
award winner and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was a I think due</font>

409
00:17:53,809 --> 00:17:59,240
to a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this kind of approach of</font>

410
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:02,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">looking at their technology so if now</font>

411
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:03,890
I'm talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole university or</font>

412
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:05,630
a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> higher education network</font>

413
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:09,740
multiple campuses potentially in all

414
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:12,170
this to do threat modeling of that you

415
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:14,270
would really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to break down now you</font>

416
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:15,920
start out just at a high level with each

417
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:18,260
of these major systems like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones I</font>

418
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,670
just mentioned and you would you would

419
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,260
eventually work through to the actual

420
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:23,900
detail of it so it would be a large

421
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:25,520
program in itself but commonly this is

422
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:28,070
used as well when you're designing new

423
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,879
solutions and you can do this sort of on

424
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:32,928
paper in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decide if the</font>

425
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,840
decisions you're making are actually

426
00:18:32,929 --> 00:18:38,990
sensible from the point of view<font color="#E5E5E5"> of how</font>

427
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">it'd be viewed by a score based system</font>

428
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:44,540
that allows you to to kind of quantify

429
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:46,760
threats and then exposures and the risk

430
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:49,100
associated with all that so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess with</font>

431
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:52,110
this one this Kitty objectives like say

432
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:53,750
if we take something like I mentioned

433
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:57,240
HR solution take something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

434
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:58,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">security objectives for the solution we</font>

435
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,660
know would you would there be

436
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:02,820
expectations<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know user identity</font>

437
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:05,490
is appropriately protected that were

438
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,049
there with the with the the applications

439
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:09,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">that have you know financial dimensions</font>

440

441
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:12,149
availability so there's all those sort

442
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:13,740
of considerations are just completely

443
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:16,080
outside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> security but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's all part of</font>

00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:17,910
the whole CIA you know come<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ality</font>

445
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:23,220
integrity and availability you know

446
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:25,919
triad as well so but so<font color="#E5E5E5"> wang that up</font>

447
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:28,290
then sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of digging into from the</font>

448
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,820
quantity of the application what's

449
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:31,500
important about the application that we

450
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:33,899
would need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually consider it from</font>

451
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,700
the point of view of being attacked<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

452
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,140
know is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it are we hosting it it somebody</font>

453
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,360
else hosting it who's responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

454
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,640
managing it who's going to maintain<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

455
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,549
so so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of answering questions</font>

456
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:46,620
like that and then going<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually into</font>

457
00:19:44,549 --> 00:19:48,809
their next step in their process<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

458
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:50,850
decomposing the application so there's a

459
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:53,309
very involved process as you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

460
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:54,540
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order to actually work through the</font>

461
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:59,850
different components your application

462
00:19:54,540 --> 00:20:00,960
and decide what I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> the how they</font>

463
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:05,428
would mean to you from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point of view</font>

464
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,890
of what helica day can be potentially

465
00:20:05,429 --> 00:20:09,630
threatened by an attacker then moving on

466
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,190
this identify threats and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

467
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:13,320
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at it i defied vulnerabilities</font>

468
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:15,510
so microsoft stuff like they have a new

469
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:17,790
initiative that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm only a little bit</font>

470
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:20,940
familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was actually I'm going</font>

471
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:23,790
to sort of mention<font color="#E5E5E5"> just just smart</font>

472
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:27,120
friends mine joining<font color="#E5E5E5"> him named matt</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the microphone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stl which is their new</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">seen with Hammond and discussions with</font>

478
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:41,879
him and it's it's some I I wanted to to

479
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:44,220
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> stick with an iterative model just</font>

480
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:45,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it's um it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something that I</font>

481
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,730
think is familiar for especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

482
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:50,730
Australia because it's like a sins at s

00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:53,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">4060</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now this kind of concept it's</font>

00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:53,940
common<font color="#CCCCCC"> sense for the point of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

485
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,010
because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other thing i didn't</font>

486
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,660
mention about this that this is

487
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:59,220
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you could do on going and</font>

488
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,870
keep feeding back into this process<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

489
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,950
well it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something you</font>

490
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,570
necessarily do<font color="#CCCCCC"> it commissioning you</font>

491
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,370
could do it as part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of operational</font>

492
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:07,010
activities and

493
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:08,929
as well but thatthat's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft's</font>

494
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:10,580
models really are around you know

495
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:13,220
building software and software solutions

496
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,540
because that's with you so but there's

497
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:16,190
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why you can't bend these two</font>

498
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:18,230
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own sort of needs and stuff so</font>

499
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:21,350
they had a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> other things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

500
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:23,150
use to actually to take threats that

501
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:25,730
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> identified and just sort of</font>

502
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:27,950
assign them to two categories

503
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:29,390
effectively or you identify threats

504
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:32,390
under these<font color="#E5E5E5"> categories in order to</font>

505
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:34,400
produce the scoring for stride for

506
00:21:32,390 --> 00:21:36,830
example so usually the way these sort of

507
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,160
things work is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have a like for</font>

508
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:42,169
example the bottom one you have a

509
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:44,150
between I think one in 20 and 50 one and

510
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:47,179
five for each of the categories for

511
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:48,740
dread which is damaged reproducibility

512
00:21:47,179 --> 00:21:50,840
exploitability affected user

513
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:54,350
discoverability and then you divide<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

514
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:57,830
by the number of those assignments that

515
00:21:54,350 --> 00:22:00,500
you made so so it's it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you get this</font>

516
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:03,040
at a scoring thing and we a number of

517
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:06,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">years ago were we're trying to do</font>

518
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:08,090
something similar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> some controls and</font>

519
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:09,679
we ended up making up this thing that

520
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:12,379
looked like a dungeon dragons character

521
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,450
sheet because we were sort of to know if

522
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,309
it's Gina strength dexterity wisdom like

523
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:19,309
it seemed to sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work you know</font>

524
00:22:16,309 --> 00:22:23,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">somehow in some nerdy way for firewalls</font>

525
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:25,428
I don't know but so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think for me like</font>

526
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:27,439
there's there's there's accepted methods

527
00:22:25,429 --> 00:22:29,780
and and and ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are consistent in</font>

528
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,370
ways that other people would would think

529
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,720
a reasonable rather than me handing them

530
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:35,989
a character sheet from Dungeons<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

531
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,760
Dragons so it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm I</font>

532
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:40,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">think what I'm sort of getting at is</font>

533
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,080
that for any of these sort of things

534
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:43,160
like we want to evaluate a solution well

535
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,570
enough to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to identify the</font>

536
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:49,880
threats to its data or its operation to

537
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:51,439
identify the exposures that may lead to

538
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:53,000
those and what the risk that means to

539
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,620
our organization so it's all of these

540
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,120
things are just about that so even

541
00:22:54,620 --> 00:23:01,209
moving on to stuff like I would never

542
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:05,059
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to use cvss to to calculate</font>

543
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:06,230
threats just because it's like everybody

544
00:23:05,059 --> 00:23:09,080
I know uses see<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sense we use</font>

545
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:12,380
calculators to do it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because um ne</font>

546
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:14,449
ne ne em anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that requires you to</font>

547
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:16,250
use I'm trimming the name of the library

548
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:17,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">in late egg but it's the one that get</font>

549
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:21,480
basically gives you all the

550
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:25,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">crazy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> math shape so that that's anything</font>

551
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:27,150
needs that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I probably don't want to be</font>

552
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,250
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> and for something where I want to</font>

553
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:30,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">get sort of direct answers in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that but</font>

554
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:32,040
it's good for certainly good for

555
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:34,050
identified<font color="#CCCCCC"> valen goodies that's what we</font>

556
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,639
use it for and you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of use it</font>

557
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:38,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">for conceptual ones but that the same</font>

558
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:41,400
idea goes to with 4360 it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

559
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:43,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's for but risk management is part of</font>

560
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:45,240
that process and you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be you know</font>

561
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,800
factoring all these things in together

562
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,150
there's probably a way to tie your

563
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,430
iterative model into another<font color="#CCCCCC"> rate of</font>

564
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:52,020
model so I'm another<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing it was new to</font>

565
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:53,580
me<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was talking to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a friend</font>

566
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:56,250
about this talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I was going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

567
00:23:53,580 --> 00:24:00,149
which is a Graham Bell who presented

568
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:04,500
here last year<font color="#CCCCCC"> and he mentioned to me</font>

569
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:07,050
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> miter attack model and framework</font>

570
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:10,590
which is this really kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of creepy</font>

571
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:15,510
cyber thing like it's neat but it's it's

572
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:18,419
a to me so what it does and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

573
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:21,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably more of what really i'm doing</font>

574
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:23,520
when we're doing testing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm kind of</font>

575
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,830
adding up the exposures that I I know

576
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,700
were likely to<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist because something I</font>

577
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,230
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> have mentioned about when I</font>

578
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:30,330
showed you that ring<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the silly star</font>

579
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:31,800
of all those applications<font color="#E5E5E5"> and each one</font>

580
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:33,750
of those categories<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's three or</font>

581
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,930
four or five<font color="#E5E5E5"> applications that are all</font>

582
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:39,420
I'm similar but not know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they solve</font>

583
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:41,730
similar problems differently but they

584
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:43,500
when we go to work with a new client

585
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,940
when we go through each<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those sort of</font>

586
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,250
categories and we work out oh you're

587
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:49,680
using this system for HR and using this

588
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:51,930
system for records management and so on

589
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,940
then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea where our</font>

590
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:56,580
starting points are just because of the

591
00:24:53,940 --> 00:25:02,010
hackers intuition and experience but

592
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:04,500
this actually maps out the I guess the

593
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:06,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">actual like the actual attack steps that</font>

594
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:08,250
we would normally take in order to if

595
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:10,500
our goal<font color="#E5E5E5"> was to exfiltrate data which</font>

596
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:12,330
usually in some form another is I'm not

597
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,780
necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the way that these this</font>

598
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:20,179
this one is to set up but so this was

599
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:22,830
developed<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mitre it was based on a</font>

600
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:24,750
research paper from from Lockheed Martin

601
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:26,189
and I kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of refer to this thing is</font>

602
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:29,340
kind of drinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber is like</font>

603
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:32,159
pretty bad here because he get this was

604
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:34,899
the name<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the paper you know</font>

605
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,210
intrusion kill chains like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

606
00:25:34,899 --> 00:25:38,979
I'm in I see the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weird</font>

607
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:40,419
advertising the airport<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Canberra like</font>

608
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,890
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't live in Canberra and like you</font>

609
00:25:40,419 --> 00:25:43,210
fly and it's always<font color="#E5E5E5"> like companies that</font>

610
00:25:41,890 --> 00:25:45,190
you would never think would pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

611
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:47,289
advertising to like buy a submarine you

612
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:49,179
know um<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're advertising that for</font>

613
00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:54,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">like one person i think you know like</font>

614
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:57,250
hey but um so um it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> my world but</font>

615
00:25:54,549 --> 00:26:00,158
the concept of it is really awesome from

616
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:03,190
what the point of what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do um</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the the</font>

617
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:06,220
creepy titled paper is really good I

618
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:08,590
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's just academic you know</font>

619
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:12,940
descriptive paper title meets you know

620
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:15,820
cyber kill chain stuff so so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess</font>

621
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:18,610
that what this leads to me is the and

622
00:26:15,820 --> 00:26:21,220
this is what are the paper that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

623
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:24,610
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have to tell you has been delayed</font>

624
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:27,549
a little bit so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I'm sorry for that but</font>

625
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:32,110
it's a it's it's basically it's on

626
00:26:27,549 --> 00:26:33,820
common exposures that we do see and this

627
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:36,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the sort of stuff that we would take</font>

628
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:38,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">advantage of as an attacker on a</font>

629
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:41,320
client's behalf but certainly we see

630
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:43,360
evidence and often find intrusions while

631
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:46,658
we're testing because we'll find an

632
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,580
exposure and like there's there's these

633
00:26:46,659 --> 00:26:50,110
be a name for the feeling of you found

634
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:51,428
something that's interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then</font>

635
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:56,439
you found that<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody else found it</font>

636
00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:58,029
for you anyway and that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess the</font>

637
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:01,720
big the biggest thing that we have is

638
00:26:58,029 --> 00:27:07,330
the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the approach to to network</font>

639
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:10,750
controls is a the approach to network

640
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:12,490
controls is is it's something that is a

641
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:14,080
great enabler of this that I'm that

642
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:18,210
scenario we have the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of filtering</font>

643
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:20,439
border with stronger controls internally

644
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:22,750
it makes that network in between a

645
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,340
relatively untrusted network and and

646
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:27,370
it's generally treated that way to buy

647
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:29,139
the institutions as well that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

648
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:31,360
have the data center networks but

649
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:35,230
they're still important things in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the in</font>

650
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:40,059
that Network and it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

651
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:41,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">know is there's also just all the the</font>

652
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:44,649
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party systems the faculty</font>

653
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:46,290
systems all of those that aren't

654
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:48,280
they're going to have the rigor that

655
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:51,070
some of the central services may

656
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:54,070
hopefully have in the environment so

657
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:55,570
it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we would want to you</font>

658
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:58,060
know as attacker we take<font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage of</font>

659
00:27:55,570 --> 00:28:00,850
this the other thing we<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage</font>

660
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:03,730
of as well is<font color="#E5E5E5"> many cases all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font>

661
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:06,520
down through the layers egress controls

662
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:08,320
aren't present and we also have

663
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:10,810
situations where we have what i refer to

664
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:13,659
as control disparity between different

665
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:16,510
parts<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the network so if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we go back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

666
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:19,320
our network diagram so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is again my</font>

667
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:22,750
you know typical<font color="#CCCCCC"> University Network</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

668
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:24,070
so places that we would see controls in

669
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">the environment i'm generally talking</font>

670
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:26,710
about network<font color="#E5E5E5"> controls controls</font>

671
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">everywhere but i'm generally talking</font>

672
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:31,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">about just keeping me out like in the</font>

673
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:33,910
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> first place for something that's a</font>

674
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:36,730
network-based or physical or any of

675
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:38,500
these sort of attacks as well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

676
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:41,350
controls up certainly in that border

677
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:43,690
environment um VPNs enforce controls by

678
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:46,270
like profile type policies and that on

679
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:48,550
users they tend to be kind of a trombone

680
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:51,490
connection off of firewalls anyway or

681
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:53,320
like out as a separate leg and coming

682
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:55,390
back into hopefully another far will

683
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:57,280
filter zone and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming back out to</font>

684
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:58,840
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and then we see controls</font>

685
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:05,820
going in through this data center

686
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:05,820
environment but we see sometimes some in

687
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:13,300
all of these like the branch campuses

688
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:15,400
around there might be endpoint controls

689
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:18,370
that usually are further the managed

690
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:20,740
systems there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are but so I kips hid's</font>

691
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:23,530
type stuff than that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but there's a huge</font>

692
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:25,660
number of internal users that aren't

693
00:29:23,530 --> 00:29:27,670
under the organization's management some

694
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:29,170
your institutions are very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

695
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:32,800
separating those two groups<font color="#E5E5E5"> of users</font>

696
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:35,140
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> mingle them all together and that</font>

697
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:37,030
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be that can lead to issues as well</font>

698
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:39,370
but there's this as some of this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

699
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:41,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">that their risk decisions that you can</font>

700
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:42,639
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> around all this based on the</font>

701
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:45,070
services<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are available these users</font>

702
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:50,560
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> um one thing that always troubles me</font>

703
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:53,020
is there's almost always a replica of of

704
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:54,610
Active Directory out in the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

705
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:57,129
general networks just because the staff

706
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:57,620
systems need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> interact with Microsoft</font>

707
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,990
service

708
00:29:57,620 --> 00:30:03,770
is like directory services off of that

709
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:05,960
system versus<font color="#CCCCCC"> um students like we're</font>

710
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:07,910
probably accessing services that may

711
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:10,550
indirectly eventually authenticate off

712
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:12,500
of that so they're not necessarily

713
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:15,409
connecting to those systems directly so

714
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:17,180
um but<font color="#E5E5E5"> file services also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> complicates</font>

715
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:18,710
some of that as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> so there's there's</font>

716
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:22,100
some of those things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they come to</font>

717
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:24,110
play there but I failed to mention here

718
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">too they again up at the red arrow here</font>

719
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:28,100
on the ingress and that it's it's just

720
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:30,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that block some pass everything</font>

721
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:32,270
else there's some just crazy<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff that</font>

722
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:35,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">we see past that that should be blocked</font>

723
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:37,760
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just generally not and I</font>

724
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:40,700
understand why<font color="#E5E5E5"> giant network and the</font>

725
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:42,710
other side of it you make this change

726
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,510
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's great for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ninety</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nine percent</font>

727
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:46,460
of the people but it stops this critical

728
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:49,700
function than that so I just like

729
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:52,160
enterprises there's internally a

730
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:54,650
reluctance to potentially apply those

731
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,300
controls but unlike enterprises the

732
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:58,940
front door<font color="#E5E5E5"> is pretty open into these</font>

733
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,889
networks and there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> plenty of unmanaged</font>

734
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:02,059
things down in the general networks and

735
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:03,710
the faculty<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in all the places like</font>

736
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:06,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">that that are great staging places for</font>

737
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:08,480
attackers the other thing that we've

738
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:11,450
seen a lot of as well is that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> depends</font>

739
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:16,370
on the approach taken with this this

740
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:19,429
environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> where certain systems are in</font>

741
00:31:16,370 --> 00:31:22,159
place like certain load balancer

742
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:23,840
technologies see a lot of clustering and

743
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:25,880
load balancing and not any packet

744
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,320
filtering so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these layers of</font>

745
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,880
things and they're all communicate and

746
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:32,030
they even<font color="#E5E5E5"> use those devices as gateways</font>

747
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,140
but if you can breach a device inside of

748
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:34,639
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those layers you can generally</font>

749
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:36,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">connect with all the other layers as</font>

750
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,940
well because we're all routed and that

751
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:41,178
device sitting in front of it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a nice</font>

752
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:43,730
gateway for it it's it really<font color="#E5E5E5"> just it's</font>

753
00:31:41,179 --> 00:31:48,640
something that egress control in

754
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:50,809
networks is it is not often present

755
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,309
since I mentioned before to about this

756
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:54,379
is the number of public addresses and

757
00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:56,870
use like that's another big initiative

758
00:31:54,380 --> 00:32:00,530
and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our clients</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is to renumber</font>

759
00:31:56,870 --> 00:32:02,120
into private addresses for systems don't

760
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:04,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">really need to be directly internet</font>

761
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:07,219
accessible but a big driver for them and

762
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:09,080
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> also is the fact that you know</font>

763
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:10,220
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> back in history they're just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font>

764
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:12,139
devices capable

765
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:14,630
you know maintaining that states and

766
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,740
things like that for you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> 30,000</font>

767
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:17,240
clients although they didn't necessarily

768
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:18,830
have 30,000 clients in here but they

769
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,179
still had a whole bunch and the device

770
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:21,230
is to actually potentially provide that

771
00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:23,390
much we're even smaller and less

772
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:26,150
powerful and so on<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I can see that</font>

773
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:27,559
history again you know as part of where

774
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:31,870
this comes from the other thing because

775
00:32:27,559 --> 00:32:34,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">it is such a giant carrier-grade network</font>

776
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:37,959
you can't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and replace something</font>

777
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:40,039
every year so there's there's very

778
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,530
deliberate planning done around two

779
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:45,080
five-year plans and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten year plans</font>

780
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:46,460
around just the the general concepts of

781
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:51,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">the network and then what they're going</font>

782
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:54,650
to do in this periods of time so but the

783
00:32:51,650 --> 00:33:01,720
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> part about the the effectiveness</font>

784
00:32:54,650 --> 00:33:03,380
of controls as well is um yeah we have

785
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:09,309
again this out-of-band management

786
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:09,309
network that will come to it a bit so um

787
00:33:09,460 --> 00:33:16,730
everything because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the fact that that</font>

788
00:33:12,770 --> 00:33:18,500
tying things back to sample for example

789
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:22,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">Shibboleth implementation a DFS</font>

790
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:25,549
implementations of sam'l authentication

791
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:29,149
will mean that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a single sign-on</font>

792
00:33:25,549 --> 00:33:30,980
function effectively in use in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

793
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:36,409
applications in place in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> University</font>

794
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:39,010
and like any<font color="#E5E5E5"> enterprise the integrity of</font>

795
00:33:36,409 --> 00:33:41,390
the directory is pretty pretty critical

796
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:45,370
but so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of ways that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

797
00:33:41,390 --> 00:33:48,620
will directly influence that by

798
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:51,289
attacking ldap attacking you know Active

799
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:52,668
Directory obviously and tackling

800
00:33:51,289 --> 00:33:55,129
identity management systems that feed

801
00:33:52,669 --> 00:33:57,409
those as well because that's a common

802
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:58,909
model we have where there's an identity

803
00:33:57,409 --> 00:34:00,830
management system of some sort that

804
00:33:58,909 --> 00:34:02,630
feeds was usually a traditional

805
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:03,830
authentication function in ldap which

806
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:04,820
goes into certain parts of the

807
00:34:03,830 --> 00:34:06,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">university</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are interesting</font>

808
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:10,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting to us and then active</font>

809
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:13,609
directory which is more of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess</font>

810
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:15,710
in many ways I don't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> say the modern</font>

811
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:18,230
services but it's it's a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

812
00:34:15,710 --> 00:34:21,080
the user facing commodity services but

813
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:22,849
also as well their identity for all this

814
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:25,869
the portal sign-on type single sign-on

815
00:34:22,849 --> 00:34:28,399
situations in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> University so um</font>

816
00:34:25,869 --> 00:34:30,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">mention</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Active Directory servers in</font>

817
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:32,710
the general networks and why I have

818
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:35,710
concerns about this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that um there</font>

819
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:37,820
there's usually a large distributed

820
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:40,070
Active Directory environment so there's

821
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:43,159
there's there's a parts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the RIT</font>

822
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:45,050
campus there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are parts that sit in</font>

823
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:47,540
certain zones of the environment there's

824
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:49,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">now a whole lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of consideration of that</font>

825
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:52,369
and how you actually organize your

826
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:56,750
Active Directory but what we do commonly

827
00:34:52,369 --> 00:34:59,270
see is this system out<font color="#CCCCCC"> here that sits</font>

828
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:02,770
there that's generally for I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think for</font>

829
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:07,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">the managed systems in labs but also</font>

830
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:10,070
faculty managed systems and so on as

831
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:13,399
well but um you get this<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a transient</font>

832
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:16,700
property of if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we you know it's active</font>

833
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:19,790
directory sync so it may be useful for

834
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:22,129
us to if this is all in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same active</font>

835
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:23,990
directory and the directory that's being

836
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:26,150
leveraged internal to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the data</font>

837
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:28,729
center is we may have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some opportunity</font>

838
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:30,859
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cascade our own identities into</font>

839
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:34,580
that environment by attacking the less

840
00:35:30,859 --> 00:35:38,869
controlled systems that are external<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

841
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:40,609
to that so and from the internet where a

842
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:42,530
bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that plays out for us is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

843
00:35:40,609 --> 00:35:45,369
this is something that's that's a really

844
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:47,270
fun tuberosity two in these environments

845
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:50,660
when you have internet facing

846
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:52,070
applications that require only user

847
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:53,270
identity and no two-factor

848
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:56,390
authentication or other forms of

849
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:59,480
validation and that then we may have

850
00:35:56,390 --> 00:36:01,400
some opportunity to know take a single

851
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:03,230
password and guess it across your you

852
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,910
know 50,000 users because we've

853
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:08,330
enumerated that through something else

854
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:10,910
to come on a bit but where it becomes

855
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:15,140
very useful for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us is being able to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use</font>

856
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:18,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">that to access either ssl vpns or XL</font>

857
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:22,279
ipsec VPN and we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> Jim to need and</font>

858
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:25,130
actually another identity component of

859
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:27,530
the identity for authenticating to IP

860
00:36:25,130 --> 00:36:30,200
SEC for that the VPN groups shared

861
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:31,910
secrets in that but you're the students

862
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">and universities do a very good job of</font>

863
00:36:31,910 --> 00:36:34,460
putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> out information out there for us</font>

865
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:39,980
because it always be someone's this is

866
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:41,990
how i did this with VPN see on<font color="#CCCCCC"> linux and</font>

867
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,330
it's like thank you that's now we just

868
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:46,819
have the<font color="#CCCCCC"> guests usernames and passwords</font>

869
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:49,670
but there's easier ways for us to do

870
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:51,770
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in other places and them part of</font>

871
00:36:49,670 --> 00:36:55,310
that comes into this as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well editor that</font>

872
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:57,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">1x is really hard we've had asked like</font>

873
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:59,180
clients for years to take it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

874
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:00,619
literally can count the number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my</font>

00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:04,129

877
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:08,570
something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's other than wireless</font>

878
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:12,230
wireless it's obviously heavily used and

879
00:37:08,570 --> 00:37:14,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">slowly well but it's it's something that</font>

880
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:16,400
I'm is it is a challenge because how do

881
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:20,089
you do in the large<font color="#E5E5E5"> networks breaking</font>

882
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:22,040
down the problem that but where that

883
00:37:20,089 --> 00:37:24,650
sort of leads into<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vikon wireless we are</font>

885
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:27,589
education and like there's a few

886
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,859
institutions that we use tificate based

887
00:37:27,589 --> 00:37:35,210
dedication which is 30 pls<font color="#CCCCCC"> dedication so</font>

888
00:37:30,859 --> 00:37:38,359
we have each device has a device or

889
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:40,670
users tificate that's used to present an

00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:43,130
identity to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the network as opposed to a</font>

892
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:47,390
exposures that have been happening over

893
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:50,330
the last couple years<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a peep which</font>

894
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:52,160
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication can use a smart card</font>

895
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:55,460
but generally I've never<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

896
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:58,640
implemented it exists but it's it's a

897
00:37:55,460 --> 00:38:00,890
it's it's a just a public like a public

898
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:02,540
key for a shared root certificate that

899
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:05,359
in most devices will actually accept of

900
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:07,880
the air of course especially apple mac

901
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:09,200
OS and iOS and then it's just using a

902
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:13,130
password again so we're back to that

903
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,629
same issue but there's the eduroam

904
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:15,980
service which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i haven't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> checked but i'm</font>

905
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:17,390
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like on the</font>

906
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:19,790
wireless service here because it's it's

907
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:23,299
something that everybody would use in

908
00:38:19,790 --> 00:38:25,670
edge rooms you know EP based and it

909
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:28,130
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can sit there and sniff</font>

910
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:34,160
traffic see the outer identities on on

911
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:37,010
on traffic and to guess identities for

912
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:40,420
another institution on the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> side of</font>

00:38:37,010 --> 00:38:43,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">the world because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're using</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the local</font>

915
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:47,940
like if i connect to because like where

916
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:50,740
our offices we're near a whole bunch of

917
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:52,390
training colleges and other smaller

918
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:55,419
institutions like that and lonsdale

919
00:38:52,390 --> 00:38:57,190
street melbourne and we can see two or

920
00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:01,420
three different edgy roams the different

921
00:38:57,190 --> 00:39:03,040
points and you know there's the

922
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:06,100
potential for someone to take advantage

923
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:07,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">of both the exposures in peep to attack</font>

924
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:09,279
the identities that are being present

925
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:12,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're presented there but also to use</font>

926
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,080
services like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to attack</font>

927
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,150
identities this was considered in the

928
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:18,310
design for<font color="#CCCCCC"> edge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Rome like they knew that</font>

929
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:19,960
that was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> potential for that and it</font>

930
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:22,240
just leaves it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the institution in</font>

931
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:27,370
some ways to notice suspicious<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

932
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:30,220
Education activity so um<font color="#CCCCCC"> so yeah let's</font>

933
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:34,569
see also<font color="#CCCCCC"> as our directory stuff I love</font>

934
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:35,890
pulling information of ldap I had just

935
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:38,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">been told a two minutes so I better</font>

936
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:42,009
actually wrap it up but yeah so

937
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:44,730
two-factor<font color="#E5E5E5"> authentication is pretty</font>

938
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:47,170
critical for us there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

939
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:50,020
management services that are used for

940
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:54,310
device provisioning that we can we take

941
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:55,270
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of advantage of the what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

942
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:57,640
mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> before about Adam Bandt</font>

943
00:39:55,270 --> 00:40:00,550
networks it's all still networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use</font>

944
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,540
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> two to do what we need to do I am</font>

945
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">really going to go through these quick</font>

946
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:08,200
because I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to make the next</font>

947
00:40:02,590 --> 00:40:11,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">person late but yeah so data secured at</font>

948
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:17,020
rest in a sense on your file services

949
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:19,839
are ours like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in many ways then we we</font>

950
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:23,830
still find a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of NFS we have a lot of</font>

951
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:25,720
fun with that we with we find a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

952
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:28,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">things in unprotected shares that just</font>

953
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:30,970
shouldn't be there including a lot of

954
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:32,589
enterprise export data that someone's

955
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:34,450
put there temporarily that we've used to

956
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:35,740
then compromised accounts to the

957
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:37,450
password reset system because we have

958
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:39,839
all the user identity information in

959
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:43,270
their HR or student data that's in it

960
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:45,340
but yeah and patching and everything is

961
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:46,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">just it's just terrible and that but I'm</font>

962
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:51,760
one point I really to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make and then I'll</font>

963
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:54,130
definitely end here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that there's this</font>

964
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:56,470
out of it's not even out of sight out of

965
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:58,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">mine like there's just the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> separation of</font>

966
00:40:56,470 --> 00:41:01,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">the research networks at universities</font>

967
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,839
and the the general networks that means

968
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:06,369
that for such a focus on the

969
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:09,940
intellectual property it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

970
00:41:06,369 --> 00:41:12,180
that I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> surprised to see it left</font>

971
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:14,470
up to so to each of these projects

972
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:16,000
because they're all different they all

973
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:18,399
do or doing sort of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and</font>

974
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:21,009
their network tends to sit off I

975
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,130
actually left a firewall there off of

976
00:41:21,009 --> 00:41:27,160
the first edge of the environment so

977
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:31,710
it's like me to leave farworlder so but

978
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:33,848
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the multi-tenant issue here</font>

979
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:36,759
there's so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> different ways</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

980
00:41:33,849 --> 00:41:39,609
provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> services to that when you host</font>

981
00:41:36,759 --> 00:41:42,490
an application and we've had situations

982
00:41:39,609 --> 00:41:44,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">where we found that we could access we</font>

983
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:46,538
were testing for one institution and

984
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:48,970
achieves some access to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the backend</font>

985
00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:51,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">database and we're able to actually look</font>

986
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:54,368
<font color="#E5E5E5">at other data on the database server and</font>

987
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:57,759
it was another<font color="#CCCCCC"> university's information</font>

988
00:41:54,369 --> 00:41:59,529
and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually went to one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of our</font>

989
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:01,150
universities<font color="#E5E5E5"> to test</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an on-premise</font>

990
00:41:59,529 --> 00:42:03,579
version of the application and confirm

991
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:07,630
that that was a that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> existed in</font>

992
00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:12,640
that as well so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's interesting so look</font>

993
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:14,079
I will skip these quick wins and look

994
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,490
we'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> just go on to the end this i</font>

995
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:18,369
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> should head over the next person</font>

996
00:42:15,490 --> 00:42:21,819
so um<font color="#CCCCCC"> i really appreciate your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time I I</font>

997
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:23,559
will get the paper released it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> inter</font>

998
00:42:21,819 --> 00:42:26,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">financial year and we've just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of</font>

999
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:27,519
hit a crunch so it's but thank you very

1000
00:42:26,170 --> 00:42:29,940
much for listening and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

1001
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:29,939
questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll be</font>
