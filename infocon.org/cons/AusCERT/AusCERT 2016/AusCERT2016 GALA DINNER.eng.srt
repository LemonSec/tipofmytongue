314
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:58,049
first of all of these things is this

315
00:21:52,260 --> 00:22:04,110
microphone right here which has no

316
00:21:58,049 --> 00:22:06,929
effect whatsoever in addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

319
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:12,928
here with me that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using</font>

320

from now on the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the left is</font>

321
00:22:12,929 --> 00:22:19,380
called an RC 505 and basically the RC

322
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:24,080
505 allows me to add a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of</font>

323
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:24,080
reverb to my voice which gives me that

324
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:38,830
flavor in addition<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the RC 505 I've</font>

328
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:48,250
see<font color="#E5E5E5"> them but basically I can use them</font>

329
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:50,530
like drum machines or samplers to take

330
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:54,750
tiny little snippets of my own sounds

331
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:54,750
and play them back on the fly like this

332
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:55,169
set<font color="#CCCCCC"> dad set so that's these little bad</font>

335
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,890
instantly realize my musical ideas and

00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:06,400
translate everything that comes up in my

337
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:09,630

713
00:51:55,390 --> 00:52:00,098
throughout the denied so that was

714
00:51:57,010 --> 00:52:02,440
fantastic cgf for those of you that are

715
00:52:00,099 --> 00:52:05,050
not aware whether it is of the the kind

716
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:06,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">of context it's an event where you have</font>

717
00:52:05,050 --> 00:52:08,500
a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of challenges in different</font>

718
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,869
categories so this year we had

719
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:13,960
challenges in network forensics in

720
00:52:10,869 --> 00:52:18,430
reverse engineering<font color="#CCCCCC"> network forensics</font>

721
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:20,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a few other areas most yeah I can't</font>

722
00:52:18,430 --> 00:52:22,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">remember all of them too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many or too</font>

723
00:52:20,829 --> 00:52:24,250
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> red wines by this stage it was kind</font>

724
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:29,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">of expecting this earlier on in the</font>

725
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:32,109
night so would have had as many so all

726
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:35,650
of the challenges<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the end got solved</font>

727
00:52:32,109 --> 00:52:37,150
with the the dog gone which is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

728
00:52:35,650 --> 00:52:38,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">the ones that I put together some kind a</font>

729
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:40,599
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit prouder that one that one</font>

730
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:43,808
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stood the longest out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

731
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:47,859
everything but<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the end they all fell</font>

732
00:52:43,809 --> 00:52:49,780
so which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> good effort we had obviously</font>

733
00:52:47,859 --> 00:52:51,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was going to do it in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reverse order</font>

734
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:54,430
because it's always nice to do the

735
00:52:51,069 --> 00:52:55,990
United three two one thing a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font>

736
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:58,149
disappointing though because the winning

737
00:52:55,990 --> 00:53:00,339
team is actually from overseas so whilst

738
00:52:58,150 --> 00:53:02,530
that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of would have built up the the</font>

739
00:53:00,339 --> 00:53:06,970
rapport we can't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that one so</font>

740
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:09,099
it is indeed the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ukrainian team dcu a</font>

741
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:13,700
that took out the flag so we can put<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

742
00:53:09,099 --> 00:53:16,590
little bit of a hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> together yeah</font>

743
00:53:13,700 --> 00:53:19,350
so from our perspective it was actually

744
00:53:16,590 --> 00:53:23,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">quite a little bit of an honor because D</font>

745
00:53:19,350 --> 00:53:26,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">CUA is currently d top-ranked CTF team</font>

746
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:27,990
around the planet so for them<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of</font>

747
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,760
participate in our little competition

748
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:31,770
was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinda kind of an honor and</font>

749
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:35,280
that they won was a little bit to be

750
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:40,950
expected however they did not solve<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dog</font>

751
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:44,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">Gone so so the local</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> teams is so second</font>

752
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:49,710
place went to capture the swag so well

753
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:51,839
