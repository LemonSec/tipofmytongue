00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:14,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">the invitation to come and speak with</font>

you today about ID care and our

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:21,470
operations 18 months on from cutting the

00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:32,308
time I have with you this afternoon

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:35,120
granted it's it's sleepy time so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and make this relatively engaging</font>

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,290
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take you on a bit of a</font>

12
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:44,160
journey as to where we've been what the

13
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:46,110
nature of our service is and where we're

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,779
heading this year that might resonate

15
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,780
with you and your organization's on I'm

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:54,690
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to annoy a few people so</font>

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,719
I let use that as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> caveat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i might upset</font>

18
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,809
a few industries on the way but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all</font>

19
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:04,110
in the interests of the community so

20
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:08,820
what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> ID care this is a very</font>

21
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:11,490
simplified version of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> landscape you</font>

22
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:15,899
have certs and response organizations

23
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:19,350
for industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> and government so whilst it</font>

24
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:22,380
obviously being one now our secret

<font color="#E5E5E5">squirrels in Canberra and cert Australia</font>

27
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:30,089
department and on your right is ID care

28
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:32,100
and our focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not on organizations</font>

29
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:34,259
government and business so much it's

30
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually on providing that support to</font>

31
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:39,180
the community so that's where we sit

32
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:41,189
within the landscape and that is a very

33
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,409
simplified version because in between

34
00:01:41,189 --> 00:01:46,039
all of that are a bunch of other

35
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:50,280
agencies<font color="#CCCCCC"> and organizations that offer</font>

36
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:52,710
reporting lines and while so it might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

37
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,200
a good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing I might challenge some</font>

38
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:56,759
debate around whether or not that might

39
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,890
actually be adding a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of confusion to</font>

40
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:02,219
the community as to where one needs to

41
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:05,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">go to get support and help it's a very</font>

42
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:11,119
complex<font color="#E5E5E5"> and crowded space the reporting</font>

43
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:11,119
space but in terms of support we are it

44
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:16,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm going to share with you a story</font>

difference is that they the company had

wised up to the fact that this didn't

100
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:29,150
quite add up and so she went down to the

of some proceeds of crime sitting in my

personal bank account what should one do

115
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:13,130
with that but her primary concern was

116
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:16,430
there there now asking me to move ten

117

disengage with this organized crime

stressful and and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might be the</font>

emotionally and we're there<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide</font>

the pragmatic pathways that individuals

need to take to build resilience around

their identity once it's compromised

of May after reporting it to them in the

157
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:16,130
first week of May via acorn the reality

00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:20,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">is she probably won't hear from place at</font>

arrest at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> she was interested in</font>

00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:28,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually getting some advice from police</font>

00:08:26,509 --> 00:08:30,469
as to what to do with the five percent

launderer and she wanted some advice at

167
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,440
the time as to how to disengage with a

168
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:42,770
large crime drug which the police are

169
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,160
well accustomed to so we've been

170
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:47,360
providing ongoing counseling with Jo and

171
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:50,439
we've got grave concerns about her

172
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,440
mental health at the moment

173
00:08:50,920 --> 00:09:00,860
so what is<font color="#CCCCCC"> ID care primarily it is a</font>

174
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,680
national case management center that is

175
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,630
our bread and butter so we operate<font color="#E5E5E5"> a 13</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">hundred number and an hour eight hundred</font>

178
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,690
route through to the Sunshine Coast

179
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:13,870
where those that don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sun's on</font>

187
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:38,239
that's actually keeping the lights on

188
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:39,800
most of the revenue that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we raise</font>

189
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,360
through our partnerships<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sponsorships</font>

190
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:46,160
go into paying for our counselors so the

191
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">national case management centers quite</font>

192
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,319
key to everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

193
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:52,910
the philosophy within ID care that we

194
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,610
knowledge shared his knowledge doubled

195
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:57,560
so there's an onus on us to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

196
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:00,560
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and inform you of what's going</font>

197
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">on out there and we also run community</font>

198
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,810
programs so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have programs in schools</font>

199
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:07,370
and programs in aged care facilities as

200
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:10,069
two groups that we believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a</font>

201
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:13,730
particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> risk of cyber and identity</font>

202
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:15,410
related crimes our board is made up of

203
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:17,870
industry and government leaders and

204
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:21,010
they're quite keen for IDK to share our

205
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:24,230
view<font color="#CCCCCC"> of how organizations can be better</font>

206
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:26,569
supporters of their<font color="#CCCCCC"> customers and how we</font>

207
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:29,000
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> support them support the community</font>

208
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:31,430
so a lot of my effort and time is spent

209
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,100
engaging with business and<font color="#E5E5E5"> government on</font>

210
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,719
what we can do to<font color="#CCCCCC"> give them a view of</font>

211
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">the customer experience that they may</font>

212
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:40,370
not see and we also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fair bit of</font>

213
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:41,600
fun of the national ID lab and that lab

214
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:45,110
is all about looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the human</font>

215
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,200
factors around<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber crime and what are</font>

216
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:49,610
those triggers psychologically that

217
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,890
individuals might experience either pre

218
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:53,300
or post these type of events and we work

219
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:56,120
very closely with our tertiary sector

220
00:10:53,300 --> 00:11:03,620
partners in Australia New Zealand in the

221
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:04,170
u.s. they're a big part of what we do is

222
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,760
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

223
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,459
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> national case management center but</font>

224
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,139
you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine if if you lose your</font>

225
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:13,579
wallet or purse how many organizations

226
00:11:10,139 --> 00:11:16,010
you might have represented in it we

227
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:19,469
spend an enormous<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of resources</font>

228
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:22,680
maintaining a library of over a thousand

229
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:25,019
response plans across industry and

230
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:27,719
government so that if you call<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

231
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:30,180
hotline not only are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you able to access</font>

232
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,320
the counseling support but you are if

233
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:34,170
you don't need<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're able to</font>

234
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">access support that says of those 20</font>

organizations in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> wallet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here is</font>

236
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:40,740
precisely the journey you'll need to

237
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:43,260
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> with all them and that's a huge</font>

238
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:47,519
investment that we make<font color="#E5E5E5"> to maintain that</font>

239
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:50,120
library we<font color="#E5E5E5"> maintain it in two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ways we we</font>

240
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,589
engage directly with<font color="#CCCCCC"> organizations and</font>

241
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:56,399
seek their views<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how that like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

242
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:58,800
customers to behave and what they should

243
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,269
prepare their customers to do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

244
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">really pay much attention to that I</font>

245
00:12:00,269 --> 00:12:06,560
should say that might seem

246
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:10,199
self-defeating we we actually test

247
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:13,649
organizations so we have a secret

248
00:12:10,199 --> 00:12:15,599
shopping area if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> like and so we're</font>

249
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:17,010
ringing organizations and testing what

250
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,949
they're doing in terms of providing

251
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:22,050
advice and the pathways that they enable

252
00:12:19,949 --> 00:12:23,939
their customers to go through and so

253
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:28,670
what you have here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the results</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

254
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:33,029
that and so let me explain that postcode

255
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:36,060
3174 in in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Melbourne so noble park and</font>

256
00:12:33,029 --> 00:12:37,949
surrounding suburbs our data is getting

257
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:40,469
so good that we know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

258
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:43,920
experience the same type of cyber

259
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:45,750
identity crime in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that post code you'll</font>

260
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,769
actually experience more harm that if

261
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:53,220
you resided here and so let me just

262
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:54,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">explain what that means putting aside</font>

263
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:58,680
the fact that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> premier of</font>

264
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:02,149
Victoria's postcode it means that

265
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:04,349
through our secret shopping testing and

266
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:06,540
through our what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> call our client</font>

267
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:09,569
experience scores so every client the

268
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,709
cause IDK almost we asked them who<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

269
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:12,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">you engaged before and what was that</font>

270
00:13:10,709 --> 00:13:15,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">experience like and what do they ask you</font>

271
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:17,870
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do and was it useful and all those</font>

272
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:19,310
measures that big business<font color="#CCCCCC"> and big um</font>

273
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:22,460
probably collect in terms of customer

274
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:26,150
experience and what spits out as a score

275
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:28,339
out of 10 the client response score is

276
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:31,850
our testing of organizations so we look

277
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:34,250
at things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many times</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your call</font>

278
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:35,930
transfer is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> available</font>

279
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:37,400
online to tell me what to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do if I'm a</font>

280
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:40,729
victim of cyber crime involving your

281
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:42,589
company<font color="#CCCCCC"> or government agency how long am</font>

282
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">I waiting on the phone we do a 10-bit 10</font>

283
00:13:42,589 --> 00:13:49,700
am-2 p.m. test to make it a bit more

284
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:51,440
consistent is the advice consistent so

285
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:53,180
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> test just once we test multiple</font>

286
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,540
times so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of effort that</font>

00:13:53,180 --> 00:14:01,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">goes into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that so this is where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I might</font>

industry so if I'm to if I'm to guess

290
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:14,270
most here would probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> work in that</font>

291
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:15,860
industry you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worst performers in</font>

292
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:19,520
the country at the moment to in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

293
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:23,089
client experience schools so that means

294
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:28,569
a score of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 8 out of 10 means</font>

295
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:31,070
that not only our clients dissatisfied

296
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:32,839
the chances are that through their

297
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:35,540
engagement with that industry they've

298
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:40,190
actually been more harmed that's what

299
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:43,430
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> means so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the reality if you</font>

300
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:44,450
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> up here at sunny Queensland if</font>

301
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,890
we're just<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at queensland</font>

302
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,120
government responses so that's an

303
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:50,900
aggregate of number of government

304
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:53,510
departments it's generally on average a

305
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:56,810
satisfactory result not a great result

306
00:14:53,510 --> 00:15:00,560
but just a satisfactory result and and

307
00:14:56,810 --> 00:15:03,560
so a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our emphasis as you would no</font>

308
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,920
doubt see now is not just placed in

309
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:09,500
supporting the individuals but it's in

310
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:12,650
trying to raise the standards of how

311
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:15,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">organizations treat their customers it's</font>

312
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:17,390
a really big part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it eight percent of</font>

313
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">our clients need face-to-face mental</font>

314
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:23,089
health treatment and the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font>

315
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:25,670
that's the case has got almost nothing

316
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:27,079
to do with a crime but everything to do

317
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:29,010
with how they're treated as a result<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

318
00:15:27,079 --> 00:15:36,260
it

319
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:38,700
so I don't paint a picture of panic but

320
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:41,130
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> country</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is broken when it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to</font>

this stuff we're not in<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good place at</font>

322
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:52,740
the moment we invested over 65,000 hours

around 114 variables per client it's not

00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:44,210
Queensland I say it's good news because

385
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:45,890
we've actually cracked the jackpot and

386
00:18:44,210 --> 00:18:48,250
had one or two clients manage to get a

387

new driver license number in Queensland

388
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:54,110
but it's still a process that's a bit

389
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:59,719
backward it's not at all preventive or

390
00:18:54,110 --> 00:19:05,899
supportive with univ jewel and then we

391

<font color="#E5E5E5">the client do that and do they then</font>

00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:08,150
asked for another 21 days well they

433
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:10,250
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they need a police report</font>

434

number and they can't get a police

report number for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber crime because</font>

it goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a corn and nine times out of</font>

that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the journey that's what happens</font>

for<font color="#E5E5E5"> people in relation to credit bureaus</font>

440
00:21:24,169 --> 00:21:33,289
thanks Dean so what have<font color="#CCCCCC"> we learnt 18</font>

00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:38,059
months on look at leave you negative

442
00:21:33,289 --> 00:21:40,158
let's talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about positive stuff in the</font>

443
00:21:38,059 --> 00:21:43,250
previous the previous presenter<font color="#E5E5E5"> from Sri</font>

444
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:45,020
Lanka cert spoke about you know offline

445
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,490
and online victimization what's

446
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:49,700
interesting as we see a blue<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

447
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:52,309
Australia so<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Microsoft telephone scan</font>

448
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:55,159
might very quickly relate<font color="#CCCCCC"> really into a</font>

449
00:21:52,309 --> 00:21:57,049
remote<font color="#CCCCCC"> access to a personal computer so</font>

450
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:59,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was at an online where's that physical</font>

451
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:02,210
right so it's a blurring of that

452
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:05,539
environment we see a mix of about half

453
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:07,710
half compromises occurring offline

454
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:09,809
compromisers cheering online

455
00:22:07,710 --> 00:22:13,020
we see almost exclusively that then

456
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:14,820
misuse occurring<font color="#E5E5E5"> online so their shift</font>

457
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:17,970
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> online environment in terms of</font>

458
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:20,639
issues so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't we don't do couple</font>

459
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:23,700
physical<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus online easily lady care</font>

460
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,950
and and when we started ID care we

461
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,600
certainly didn't define identity theft

462
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:30,960
her identity crime we let the consumers

463
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:34,289
define it for us what you see there is

464
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:37,200
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> summary of what our data tells us 18</font>

465
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:39,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">months on 19 hours is the average time</font>

466
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,220
it takes someone to effectively respond

467
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,919
as much as they can through all of those

468
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:48,120
scenarios<font color="#E5E5E5"> i just presented to you</font>

469
00:22:42,919 --> 00:22:49,470
unsurprisingly what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting which</font>

470
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:53,850
I think parallels the sri lankan

471
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:56,720
experience is the dominance women<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

00:22:53,850 --> 00:23:00,449
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it reflects who is actually</font>

00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:04,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">a victim here I think it just reflects</font>

474
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:05,730
the gender that's more likely<font color="#CCCCCC"> to I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

475

476
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:10,700
out but those that are reaching<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

477
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,149
unsurprisingly 25 to 44 year olds is the

478
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,709
segment of the market that's most

479
00:23:15,149 --> 00:23:19,590
prevalent and that tends to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reflect</font>

480
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:22,580
those that are transactional more so as

481
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:25,830
I surprise there this is a kicker

482
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:27,539
eighty-seven percent self detect so of

484
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:31,799
in terms of detection the vast majority

485
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:33,720
of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> calling us are the ones who</font>

486
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:35,879
are detecting at first and they're often

487
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:38,970
detecting it through the misuse activity

488
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,679
such as a bill in the mail or some other

489
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:42,029
type of indicator that their identities

490

just shy reporting to law enforcement so

495
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:55,529
there's a massive gap in the

496
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:57,029
intelligence around law enforcement as

497
00:23:55,529 --> 00:23:58,679
to what's going on here<font color="#E5E5E5"> or other</font>

498
00:23:57,029 --> 00:24:01,919
although<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that might be changing</font>

499
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:05,549
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a corn at least the information</font>

500
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,529
around that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> 27,000 or just over was</font>

501
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:10,679
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> average value of misuse experience</font>

502
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:15,990
but there was a huge range so the medium

503
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:17,490
was around<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12,000 for that one we had</font>

504
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,230
only three percent unsurprisingly

505
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:21,090
feeling very dissatisfied with their

506
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:23,310
experience with organizations

507
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:25,230
so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably knew the most of you</font>

508
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:27,540
that don't see then that consequential

509
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:29,670
impact of the industry<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you work in</font>

510
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:34,889
and love so much in terms of security

511
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:36,300
that this is the human impact we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

512
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:38,640
a partnership model so those are

513
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,930
interested in tempting fate and

514
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,880
partnering with ID care as an

515
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:44,100
organization then and we'd love to have

516
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,990
a discussion with you as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned</font>

519
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:53,070
is a bit of a sense of where your

520
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,919
organization sits in terms of how it

521
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:57,480
responds to its customers but also

522

there's a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> activities you</font>

575
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:44,550
date<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you'll think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of yourself well</font>

576
00:27:42,970 --> 00:27:46,870
I've never engaged with Telstra and

577
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:49,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's an indicator that your identities</font>

578
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:51,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">being misused now that the issue there</font>

579
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:54,070
is if on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> credit report you see</font>

580
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:55,659
instances of identity theft the<font color="#E5E5E5"> credit</font>

581
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:57,189
bureaus aren't the one to correct it it

582
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,510
has to be the credit provider so then

583
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:00,220
you have to go to each of the individual

584
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:09,280
ones to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get them to investigate to then</font>

585
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:11,620
correct a credit record yeah yeah the

586
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:16,990
most important thing the police<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do</font>

587
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:19,090
in this crime type is obtained

588
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:22,480
confidence that it's a legitimate report

589
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:24,699
and provide a report number if police

590
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,980
were to investigate all identity crime

591
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:29,560
they would do nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> else except</font>

592
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:31,150
investigate identity crime so that's not

593
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:33,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">the solution</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's we can't arrest our</font>

594
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:35,800
way out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this that they play a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

595
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:38,260
important role and the role that they

596
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:40,899
play that so important is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a legitimacy</font>

597
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:43,780
exercise to say this is a bona fide a

598
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:46,100
victim<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the ecosystem needs to pay</font>

599
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:50,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">attention</font>

600
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:50,590
why call up and they gave me a number

601
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,220
you'd be able to extend your credit band

602
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:03,230
if you need to you'll be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

603
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:05,330
police you'll be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a new</font>

604
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:06,559
license number if it's been misused<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

605
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:47,899
can't get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> without a police report</font>

606
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:50,870
number yep it's the only<font color="#CCCCCC"> one the address</font>

607
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:54,230
points to where they get the utilities

610
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:02,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worries me is that</font>

611
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:03,230
they tell me that my driver's license is

612
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:06,500
the property of the queen's own

613
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:08,720
government so do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it would be</font>

614
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,700
viable for the Queensland Government to

615
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,309
start to say to these people who are

616
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:16,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">scaling Queensland official documents</font>

617
00:30:13,309 --> 00:30:19,789
that they have to for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> RPC idea</font>

618
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:22,600
says they have to have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> stand for if</font>

619
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:26,020
they want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to keep those licenses</font>

620
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:28,209
certain period of time because once the

621
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:31,720
criminals work out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these licenses</font>

622
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:34,059
are sitting on servers in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the surf club</font>

623
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,250
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> the road and everywhere else and</font>

624
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:40,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's millions of them being scanned</font>

625
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:42,340
every day I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> listed the queensland</font>

626
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:43,780
government can and all governments can

627
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:51,699
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> away and say that is our</font>

628
00:30:43,780 --> 00:31:02,260
application the hotel yes I I have a

629
00:30:51,700 --> 00:31:06,400
copy<font color="#E5E5E5"> right here so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a this is a</font>

630
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:09,250
fantastic topic under the privacy laws

631
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:13,840
in Australia we have a legal right to

632
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:18,669
say no but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reality is we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have</font>

633
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:20,949
a practical right and I would argue as

634
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:25,360
those friends in common would and I've

635
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:27,159
heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> them before say why would you put</font>

636
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,219
your organization and risks like that by

637
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:32,590
scanning those documents it is a pretty

638
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:34,539
legitimate question and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> pose that in</font>

639
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:36,340
the media last year and got a hotel

640
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:37,539
association representatives say that

641
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:42,030
they've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best security and</font>

642
00:31:37,539 --> 00:31:45,429
they're all fine so so we can just relax

643
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:46,510
I think it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> great point if Queens</font>

644
00:31:45,429 --> 00:31:47,950
ain't government<font color="#E5E5E5"> said it's our</font>

645
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:49,299
credential then I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> about 50</font>

646
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,799
million dollars worth of loss that I can

647
00:31:49,299 --> 00:31:52,090
shift to them from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that are</font>

called ID care if they're happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

649
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:58,270
accept that i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a it's a debate</font>

650
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:02,020
that's a debate for most that issue

651
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:04,150
documents of one of convenience and it's

652
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:07,150
convenient in one hand to say you own it

653
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:09,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">and when it's not it's convenient to</font>

654
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:13,200
just wipe your hands of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

00:32:09,909 --> 00:32:15,880
as a thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> i like the idea of maybe</font>

656
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:18,280
taking identity to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> place of</font>

657
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:20,740
seriousness that it actually needs to be

658
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:23,889
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why it probably hasn't got</font>

659
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:26,230
there yet is because not many people can

660
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:28,299
see that human impact that it's having

661
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:29,850
in the community now the financial

662
00:32:28,299 --> 00:32:33,730
institutions that we work with every day

663
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:35,580
the big banks I've got processes that

664
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:37,380
are generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

665
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:39,120
and you'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that no scoring that</font>

666
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,740
already showed you before they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

667
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:47,010
because they're motivated financially to

00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:49,170
get it good<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay but but i think you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of theirs was used to set up the account</font>

685
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,660
although that's something we do stress

with our clients to go back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

688
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:45,929
point that one realizes that it is the

license you could you have to look or

690
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:49,710
reengineer what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> application process</font>

691
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:52,050
is to see how your license might have

00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:54,870
been misused<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's seventeen percent</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have no idea I've got an assumption</font>

694
00:33:54,870 --> 00:34:04,320
but they have no real confidence of

695
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:07,290
where the compromise was are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get good</font>

696
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,850
success because we we refer them to the

00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:10,469
Privacy Commissioner who we have on

698
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:12,210
speed dial to just make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure they</font>

understand what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the rights are of the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">industry Ombudsman path because they</font>

704
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:25,730
then starts costing them more money than

705
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:29,339
just telling them or was their license

706
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:31,940
yeah but that takes us to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

707
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:34,940
and we are seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tip of the iceberg</font>

708
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,940
yeah

709
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:45,639
don't feel disappointed or depressed we

710
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:47,849
can do something about this thanks

everyone
