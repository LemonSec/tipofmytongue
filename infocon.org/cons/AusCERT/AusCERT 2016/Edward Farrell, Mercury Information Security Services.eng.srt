in five six weeks time so cyber war I

25
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:22,680
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand why I went in for</font>

26
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">this talk and why I've been presenting</font>

27
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,630
on the subject a lot in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last six to</font>

28
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,460
eight months is really to understand a

29
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:34,560
little bit about myself so I own and run

30
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,329
my own pen testing firm in Sydney<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

prior to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I spent several years</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">also working as a network engineer so</font>

37
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:58,289
I've come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this technical stream</font>

38
00:01:52,320 --> 00:02:01,679
over the past 10 15 years which has

39
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:05,149
formed into and my current or where I do

40
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,970
a fair amount in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security space</font>

41
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:10,840
including vulnerability research

42
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:14,420
and and a few other bits<font color="#E5E5E5"> and pieces but</font>

43
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:16,970
at the same time have also been working

44
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:20,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot in the Army Reserves base as well</font>

45
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:21,560
for the last eight years I've generally

46
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">speaking tried to separate both</font>

47
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,280
environments<font color="#E5E5E5"> because they are different</font>

48
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:28,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the last two to three years I've</font>

49
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,500
started to see a lot of convergence

50
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,359
between the two and so I've had my

51
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,470
civilian career on one side and<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

52
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,250
military career on another<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

53
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:40,880
starbiter will come into contact a lot

54
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:42,800
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than I had expected and and so in</font>

55
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,290
one case<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see on the information</font>

56
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,290
security side a lot of thinking around

57
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:50,900
and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of incorrect thinking in my</font>

58
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:52,880
opinion as a soldier around how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we think</font>

59
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,530
about things militarily in the

60
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:55,970
information security space and then

61
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:58,360
we're now starting to see the military

62
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:00,980
space start to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how we do</font>

63
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,780
technology and they're trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to apply</font>

64
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:04,399
these other different concepts and my

65
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:08,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">biggest fear and certainly one of the</font>

66
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:11,870
reasons why I<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about a lot is we're</font>

67
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:13,609
applying too much into this into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

68
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:15,530
cyber and cyber wall space a lot of

69
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,910
military thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> in principles in an</font>

70
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:18,500
environment that's far from militaristic

71
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:20,750
and that's something I've observed

72
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:23,510
throughout our civilian career prior to

73
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:26,360
my military career and even drink and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

74
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:29,209
me the big point around this comes back

75
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:32,989
to that that one word<font color="#CCCCCC"> over what what is</font>

76
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:35,980
cyber I started<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing a lot of tweets</font>

77
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:38,810
and a lot of general discussion around

78
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:41,030
the pessimism towards the word cyber

79
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:43,130
about five years ago and then industry

80
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:45,140
suddenly adopted saying look cyber is

81
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:47,060
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> our clients want Cypress what our</font>

82
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:51,859
clients are going to get but I then

83
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:53,390
start dwelling well why what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is it is it</font>

84
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:54,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">meant to be computer network so why</font>

85
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:57,798
don't we refer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it as computer</font>

86
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:59,390
networks is it technology or is it

87
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:02,570
social media then why don't we reference

88
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:04,548
it at in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that terminology so familiar a</font>

89
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,440
lot of this questioning about what what

90
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:08,810
is cyber it throws a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people</font>

91
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:10,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">off-balance when it's really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just there</font>

92
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:12,530
to start to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that appreciation</font>

93
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:15,170
process flowing of establishing what

94
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:18,589
exactly it is we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about now</font>

95
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:20,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">the the US military defined cyberspace</font>

96
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:22,460
as a global main within the

97
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:24,440
environment consisting of independent at

98
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:27,049
works of information technology and if

99
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:30,740
structures containing resident data a

100
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:32,630
bit of a mouthful but then again it

101
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,430
highlights the term interdependent

102
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:38,060
networks now speaks<font color="#E5E5E5"> this morning</font>

103
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:40,400
highlighted stuck<font color="#CCCCCC"> set for example and</font>

104
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:41,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">that was not necessarily an independent</font>

105
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,299
and network in<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact it was a very</font>

106
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,180
separate network so does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that still fall</font>

107
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:48,950
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that space or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> does it not so in this</font>

108
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:53,570
case we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> form definition to meet a</font>

109
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:55,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">very specific aim which look I commend</font>

110
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:57,979
them on it but we then start seeing

111
00:04:55,820 --> 00:05:01,130
people deviate away from that definition

112
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:03,229
so a lot of the time the the absence of

113
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,120
really properly defined term knowledge

114
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:07,280
around this causes all sorts of issues

115
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:11,060
and if we looked at in a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> clods fits</font>

116
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,469
in view the<font color="#E5E5E5"> inability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to perform the</font>

117
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:14,540
needs definitions is an immediate

118
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:15,860
failure of the principles of<font color="#E5E5E5"> war which</font>

119
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,320
have dictated a lot of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> military's</font>

120
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,570
food<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last 200 years things such as</font>

selection of maintenance the aim economy

122
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:25,580
of effort maintenance of momentum our

123
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:29,630
inability to specify that end state will

124
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:30,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">set us up for failure so continuing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

125
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,750
with that theme<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what's wrong with</font>

126
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:36,140
using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> word cyber that the big one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

127
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:37,880
me is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual etymology so having</font>

128
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,940
done<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit of research on on this on</font>

129
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:45,830
where a lot of our modern thought

130
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:49,520
process came about this the language we

131
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:51,560
use is has a heavy foundation in 1980s

132
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,330
science fiction to describe the

133
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,120
environment<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was evolving in the</font>

134
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">technology scene at the time we then had</font>

135
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:59,840
a slightly less not safe for work

136
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:03,739
definition in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 1990s and then the</font>

137
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:08,479
word sort of faded away<font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people got</font>

138
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:10,220
that joke we then sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of saw the the</font>

139
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:14,000
word fade away and then we started<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

140
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:16,789
see its revolution<font color="#CCCCCC"> into security and</font>

141
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,100
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> security I mean no I still yet to</font>

142
00:06:16,789 --> 00:06:21,889
really hear it used isolated from the

143
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:23,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">concept of security and defense when so</font>

144
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:25,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">its place in science fiction as well</font>

145
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:28,219
it's real reliance on<font color="#E5E5E5"> fiction to create</font>

146
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:30,349
fat has conjured up this great illusion

147
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:32,060
so we started communicating these vague

148
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:34,449
references where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have any</font>

149
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,639
actual facts which means we<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose</font>

150
00:06:34,449 --> 00:06:39,490
what is said we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have any substance</font>

151
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,550
and we set ourselves up for failure and

152
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:46,180
that disconnect is a massive

153
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:48,610
miscommunication and if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing</font>

154
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,680

155
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:52,449

156
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,089

for<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and therefore</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fail our</font>

159
00:06:57,999 --> 00:07:02,559
then we started<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing also its</font>

00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:04,110
continued use in a number of streams and

161
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:08,289
I'll touch on this a little bit later

162
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:10,029
we're just by continuingly at continuing

163
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:12,729
use just as a general reference to

164
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:14,710
anything we can quite quickly lose

165
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:17,469
understanding of what's taking place and

166
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,719
so when we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually answer this</font>

167
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:22,629
question properly or when we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

168
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:25,899
backing that I I mentioned we start

169
00:07:22,629 --> 00:07:28,990
seeing really<font color="#E5E5E5"> obscure things coming out</font>

170
00:07:25,899 --> 00:07:30,849
we start seeing Obama throughout his

171
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,610
administration and I'll discuss on this

172
00:07:30,849 --> 00:07:35,889
at several stages<font color="#CCCCCC"> has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had a very heavy</font>

00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:41,680
concepts / strategy and so all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font>

sudden any illusionary events that take

place in cyberspace can be met with a a

177
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:54,039
a kinetic response my favorite one is

178
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:56,050
Islamic state militant and militants and

179
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:57,459
the the reference round they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

us they've been doing our appreciation

182
00:07:59,889 --> 00:08:04,930
over the last 18 months of what's been

183
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:07,300
taking place in that realm a lot of

184
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:10,810
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> activities their focus quite</font>

185

heavily on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the information dominance an</font>

188
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:21,219
so down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to what we observe as a school</font>

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> their intent one could argue that</font>

quite effectively based on their

00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:29,520
understanding but we then sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of go</font>

193
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:32,260
down the list we look at Donald Trump

194
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,088
just as his election was<font color="#E5E5E5"> saying to get</font>

195
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,979
started off before he wanted to build a

Mexican what was staged consider

00:08:35,979 --> 00:08:42,459
building a an internet wall which look

198
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:45,519
for me fundamentally I disagree with the

199
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:47,888
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the day you know the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

200
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,929
cultural and economic benefits we

201
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:51,819
get from the internet are based on its

202
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:54,459
openness and the sudden<font color="#E5E5E5"> knee-jerk</font>

203
00:08:51,819 --> 00:08:56,439
response that we see based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font>

204
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:59,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">this language is the end result of that</font>

205
00:08:56,439 --> 00:09:02,529
and then we start seeing other events

206
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:04,959
that take place such as the advocacy of

207
00:09:02,529 --> 00:09:06,850
our backdoors or weakening security

208
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:09,160
controls and then just<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sheer</font>

209
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:14,109
inability to understand it our keynote

210
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:17,169
yesterday drew this for some of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

211
00:09:14,109 --> 00:09:20,199
key intelligence professionals during a

Senate hearing where a for those of you

<font color="#E5E5E5">that know senator</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ludlam he's</font>

214
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:27,040
technically quite competent I believe

215
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,749
he's background was web design or or he

216
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,649
had it's a very strong technical

217
00:09:28,749 --> 00:09:34,509
background his inability to but<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

218
00:09:32,649 --> 00:09:37,660
questions to a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people off guard</font>

219
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:40,209
and so what we start to see is we start

220
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:43,209
continuing this path down the wrong way

221
00:09:40,209 --> 00:09:45,248
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> immediately from the senior level we</font>

222
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:47,498
<font color="#CCCCCC">have all of these statements that get</font>

pushed out and then immediately<font color="#E5E5E5"> under</font>

00:09:47,499 --> 00:09:52,689
people don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> any direction and we</font>

225
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:57,579
set them up for failure in the top left

226

233

236
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:27,129
security but the the lack of

237
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:29,470
understanding what<font color="#CCCCCC"> was there resulted in</font>

238
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:33,209
some really poor<font color="#E5E5E5"> outputs so they had</font>

solutions that haven't had any creative

thought or there

250
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,720
they're being framed completely in a

251
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:08,579
militaristic mindset<font color="#CCCCCC"> where so if you</font>

253
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:12,180
little bit faded there but the idea or

254
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:15,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">of this was as a data loss prevention</font>

any<font color="#CCCCCC"> Content that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was opened would call</font>

256

back to a server when it was opened and

257
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:24,959
therefore if someone unauthorized was

258
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,580
opening it it would do a call back of

259
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,470
course this comes back to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole ad</font>

defense conceptualization of

262
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:34,949
everything is going to be communicating

without any knowledge or information

268
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:47,520
that's an accurate reflection of the

269

space at a lower level<font color="#E5E5E5"> because of</font>

up we start setting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up for failure and</font>

272
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,710
so I argue whether this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a result</font>

273
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,440
of at a leadership level individuals

275
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:04,410
up not being suitably trained or

276
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:09,540
prepared especially around correcting

<font color="#CCCCCC">start resolve this i mentioned before as</font>

00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:18,060
we start using the word cyber as we

start bring it<font color="#CCCCCC"> down to the engineering</font>

00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:44,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">specifically at lower levels to provide</font>

292
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:47,970

293
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:49,710
so my favorite one is you've probably

294
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:51,690
heard a few vendors broken out there

around<font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber forensics cyber penetration</font>

296
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:55,740
testing why don't we use the actual

297
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:58,800
specific language that's already been

298
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,060
around for the last 20 years you know

299
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,609
things like<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I balloons why not</font>

300
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:04,380
computer network defense and as a result

301
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:07,230
of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can actually start isolating</font>

302
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:09,000
ourselves to all right we've only got to

303
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:13,110
focus on the defense of these computer

304
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,819
networks and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> leading on from this we</font>

305
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:17,220
start thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things around</font>

306

start to take the we start to remove the

00:13:22,289 --> 00:13:25,439
fanciful language and it just at the end

309
00:13:24,089 --> 00:13:28,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the day happens to be a bunch of us</font>

310
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:30,839
nerds on computers and now that's not to

311
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:33,929
say we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't fully established its</font>

313
00:13:33,929 --> 00:13:37,439
that appreciation and we can start

<font color="#E5E5E5">building up from there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and so on the</font>

a resolve this all these social biases

333
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:31,738
leaders tend to have a lot of social

334
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:33,899
biases formed on prior learning so

335
00:14:31,739 --> 00:14:37,499
militaries will fight as they did in

336
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:39,299
their last war and that's what leaders

337
00:14:37,499 --> 00:14:41,699
get used to so individuals forming their

338
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:43,228
opinions on the ground at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time will</font>

339
00:14:41,699 --> 00:14:49,019
then start playing that out because it's

340
00:14:43,229 --> 00:14:51,929
worked successfully in the past and so

<font color="#CCCCCC">pontification without the knowledge or</font>

346
00:15:01,709 --> 00:15:09,299
technical intricacies now we talked

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> before the the reliance the almost</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">effects means that that absence of</font>

lower levels for<font color="#E5E5E5"> for failure another</font>

353
00:15:24,269 --> 00:15:28,780
favorite one I have here is when people

354
00:15:25,649 --> 00:15:29,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">start articulating in this space</font>

355
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:32,980
that they're not technical which isn't

356
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,660
anything wrong but one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

357
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:38,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">start to observe based on an</font>

358
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:39,670
individual's approach is how they start

359
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,050
presenting themselves is not technical

360
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:43,870
as to whether it's I understand the

361
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:46,750
fundamental concept of something and can

362
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:48,670
direct it appropriately or is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font>

363
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,170
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is all someone else's problem</font>

364
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:52,810
and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sitting here and you start</font>

365
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,699
to to see that the measure of leadership

366
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:57,010
then becomes too what's their approach

367
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,440
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's what's the outcomes that you</font>

368
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:02,470
start observing does it turn into a

369
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,810
dismissal of technology as a a magical

370
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:06,760
box that does something does this start

371
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:10,930
to become a divisive characteristic of

372
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:13,270
that individual the problem here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is as I</font>

373
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:15,430
alluded to<font color="#E5E5E5"> with some of the leadership</font>

374
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:17,439
strategies we've seen in the past we

375
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:19,479
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing problems get isolated to</font>

376
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:23,080
technical problems that demand technical

377
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:25,120
solutions and that's that starts become

378
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:27,720
quite dangerous so when we start

379
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,300
isolating all this thought process add

380
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:34,600
to leadership that doesn't necessarily

381
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:36,939
present itself as having a an

382
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,770
understanding at a fundamental level we

383
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:40,540
start going<font color="#E5E5E5"> down this problem nexus of</font>

384
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:43,660
where our problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> also become</font>

385
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:47,099
attributed to a a single solution in

386
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:50,199
order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say just fire</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> users and so</font>

387
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:52,390
having existed in both domains i<font color="#CCCCCC"> started</font>

388
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:56,170
to observe the outcomes within the

389
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:57,880
military sense to be very similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

390
00:16:56,170 --> 00:17:00,729
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> things we started seeing in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mosul</font>

391
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,590
2014 so we're now starting to see at

392
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:06,069
this evolution of large bureaucracies

393
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:10,450
and governance in order to achieve these

394
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:12,819
missions or whatever cyber is very

395
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:15,310
similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Mosul in 2014 we started to</font>

396
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:17,260
see this translate into what I would

397
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:21,190
classify zorconian defense measures that

398
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:24,760
are labor-intensive and this is this is

399
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:27,610
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've observed in in</font>

400
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,830
cyberspace<font color="#CCCCCC"> and as some organizations</font>

401
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:31,449
start to to build up their capability in

402
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:34,360
that area which means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we start</font>

403
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:37,960
seeing frustrated users now the<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess</font>

404
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:39,669
the the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> biggest issue they had in</font>

405
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:41,920
most of them was the complete

406
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:42,280
ideological separation between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

407
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,000
soon

408
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:48,570
both in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CSL do we start seeing that</font>

409
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:51,460
similar to<font color="#CCCCCC"> buy Cygnus in cyberspace</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

410
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:53,679
suppose maybe maybe not<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you started</font>

411
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:55,810
seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> as the defensive</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mosul was</font>

412
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,730
prepared a lot of intrusive activities

413
00:17:55,810 --> 00:18:00,850
that provided no material value to the

414
00:17:57,730 --> 00:18:01,810
defense and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just it frustrated</font>

415
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:04,480
everyone and then all of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sudden you</font>

416
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:06,129
had the outcome<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this was that there</font>

417
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:11,500
was a lot of money being thrown<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

418
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:14,230
no oversight<font color="#CCCCCC"> and no actual value so this</font>

419
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:17,560
I suppose both of those points<font color="#E5E5E5"> leads</font>

420
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:20,140
into that strategy with technology will

421
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:23,560
always trump this technological approach

422
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:25,090
that we isolate ourselves to and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort</font>

423
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:29,580
of sore symptoms of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in our keynote</font>

424
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:31,240
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wednesday where there's this ongoing</font>

425
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,610
persistence will the solution that

426
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:35,920
technology will solve our problems the

427
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,600
idea that we can tap all the signals and

428
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:40,900
therefore we can listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> on everything</font>

429
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:44,439
and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem is solved and we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

430
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:46,060
seeing that so conversely it's going to

431
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,220
be our ability to manage technology that

432
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:50,320
will win and it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just the strategy</font>

433
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:53,500
line and we see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now and a lot</font>

434
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:56,409
of policies in the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US there's</font>

currently in over lines on the ISR

00:18:56,410 --> 00:19:03,750
capabilities of the US government such

assassination of a Taliban leader using

00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:11,949
a drone which for a lot of people we've

440
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,380
got that that bring that<font color="#CCCCCC"> blinking</font>

442
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:18,370
but what we don't have is an

443
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:20,830
appreciation of what is taking place in

444
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:23,320
the physical domain as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> result of those</font>

point was the was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pakistani response</font>

447
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:30,760
which is this violates our sovereignty

448
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:34,120
you've upset a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our locals here</font>

449
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:36,910
this isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go down too well and</font>

450
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:40,360
so as we start isolating cyber as this

451
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:43,620
fifth domain we then start seeing that

452
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:46,689
that exact same problem start to emerge

453
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:48,729
where we don't understand that the world

454
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:51,520
is interconnected and that the ubiquity

455
00:19:48,730 --> 00:19:53,050
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology tied in with that means</font>

456
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,559
that this is no longer<font color="#CCCCCC"> a self licking</font>

00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,758

460
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:05,840
important to understand what one

462
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:11,658
this author David Kilcullen he's an

475
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:48,320
and you've seen this consistently and

476
00:20:44,929 --> 00:20:53,919
the author actually draws on to what we

477
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:56,720
saw in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mumbai attacks in 2000 in</font>

2006 or 2008 don't quote me on that one

479
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,940

degradation which to a lesser extent

496
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,769
we've seen in Syria and Iraq and

certainly in parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of northern Africa</font>

498
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:46,519
means that there's going to be shortages

the failure of governance and of

there at the a person level then the

we're at company size of<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100 hundred</font>

00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:41,659
start still seeing the resolution we

00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:49,280
order to articulate the environment now

522
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:53,120
I'm in two minds about how the hardened

523
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:55,220
and network arm can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> secured firstly</font>

524
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,770
the complexity of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this space kind of</font>

525
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:59,900
contributes to its security in that the

526
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:02,420
ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to execute attack is somewhat</font>

527

delay provided certain provisions<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist</font>

528
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:08,180
now having stated that we then start

529
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,909
looking at specific architectural

530
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:13,180
considerations on this battle space<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with your compartmentalization</font>

00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:18,410
making<font color="#CCCCCC"> it sloman expensive to attack and</font>

533
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:20,900
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually start tying that in with</font>

534
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:22,280
early action and detection and these are

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be the things that will defend</font>

rolling all out with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sensors</font>

everywhere and engaging in labor

intensive activity in order to defend

540
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:36,080
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> really starts coming back to a</font>

541
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:39,560
design implementation and getting those

542
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:41,179
basic concepts right but then we start

543
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:43,850
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that we we start considering</font>

544
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:46,700
that the size and complexity of it means

545
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:48,409
our ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to adapt quickly can also be</font>

546
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:51,080
heaven and you see a lot of defense

547
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:54,980
contractors take a very historical

548
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:56,149
approach to how we engage in that they

549
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:57,860
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're manufacturing</font>

550

aircrafts and ships which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

551

these projects need to be long<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

DARPA a piece of technology that came

556
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,020
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a device built for about</font>

four thousand dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> which effectively</font>

562
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:33,360
go to a bit more detail<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that so</font>

563
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:35,160
we're also now conceptualising war and

564
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:39,290
my big fear is we're still actually

565
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:43,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">planning placing too much of our</font>

00:24:39,290 --> 00:24:46,649
emphasis on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> lower stages of of war</font>

567
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:49,050
is itself a massive spectrum from piece

568
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:51,180
to certain activities that lead to an

569
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:55,409
eventual destabilization and then

570
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:58,020
all-out war low intensity conflicts and

<font color="#CCCCCC">and evolve and so one of the things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

576
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:14,010
seriously advocate is actually the use

to prevent that degradation and I guess

this comes back to my other<font color="#E5E5E5"> big field</font>

00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:26,189
to see everyone start applying cyber in

its traditional militaristic in a

traditional militaristic role which is

584
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:33,240
to seek out and close with the enemy to

prevent going<font color="#E5E5E5"> down this sliding scale</font>

591
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:55,260
and there's already a few really good

Western nation things descended into

chaos quite quickly so the ability to

603
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:34,320
in providing humanitarian assistance was

604
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,990
important you use you've seen this a lot

00:26:37,059 --> 00:26:40,600
see specifically in the the case of how

608

she was they were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start wheezing</font>

00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:45,879
at the correction they were able to take

00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:58,030
here's a piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> technology a couple of</font>

614
00:26:54,550 --> 00:27:00,340
guys have innovated that's provided a c2

00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:02,920
mechanism for a humanitarian response

616
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:05,889
which realistically if you look at

617
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:07,780
Australia's activities in Fiji in the

618
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:09,520

we've done the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Solomon Islands is an</font>

620
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:13,240
interesting case and I really like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

621
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:15,428
investigate further adds to whether

622
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:18,070
there's technological solutions we could

623
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:21,970
have introduced that could have aided in

624
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:24,610
preventing that degradation to a civil

<font color="#E5E5E5">unrest but I guess the other thing here</font>

626
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:28,209
militaristic Lee is we can start

627
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:32,260
learning<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some other effects on top of</font>

growth areas you see in you you see in

633
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:49,540
the developed world is the use of mobile

were taken place in this new cream where

you've certainly seen a lot here is that

00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:31,149
there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a fair amount of</font>

transparency in in what is taking place

on the ground<font color="#E5E5E5"> because everyone now has</font>

right now is slowly getting retaken by

Iraqi security forces and we can start

seeing

658
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:55,530
just down towards the bottom right the

the actions that are taken place there

660
00:28:55,530 --> 00:29:00,070
what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting about this map as</font>

well about this<font color="#E5E5E5"> service as well was we</font>

started<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing Russian forces in</font>

00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:19,900
once again awesome source of information

<font color="#E5E5E5">that could in fact be perhaps better</font>

00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:36,850
is right industrial control systems what

do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do we're going to use it to start</font>

blowing power plants and causing all

677

sorts of damage and then blowing up dams

678

and reliving 617 squadron the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reality is</font>

679
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:51,940
though and something I advocate quite

680
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:53,920
heavily is the conflicts we learn to be

00:31:40,809 --> 00:31:46,510
simple fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we then start isolating</font>

725
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:48,669
what we do I still don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

726
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:53,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">enough we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have had enough time this</font>

727
00:31:48,669 --> 00:31:55,210
space to start isolating ourselves one

728
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:57,490
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> evident is that in a</font>

729
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:59,740
military context taking militarized

730
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:01,539
approaches of seeking out closing with

731
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:05,440
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> enemy to kill or capture them isn't</font>

732
00:32:01,539 --> 00:32:07,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">exactly the most appropriate but once</font>

733
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,549
again if militaries are looking at how

734
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:11,918
and where we adapt this you know what

735
00:32:09,549 --> 00:32:13,330
will be and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> suppose there comes in a</font>

736
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,789
slightly more balanced approach that

737
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:19,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">needs to take place over the next three</font>

738
00:32:15,789 --> 00:32:24,158
to five years the reliance on technology

739
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:25,419
we've seen over the last six<font color="#E5E5E5"> or seven</font>

740
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:29,470
years especially around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Obama</font>

741
00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:31,539
government has actually been not as

742
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:33,070
successful as if there was once again<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

743
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:36,179
more balanced approached and yet we're

744
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:38,320
also seeing at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same time a very</font>

745
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:41,289
information having leadership heavy a

746
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:44,020
strategy as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're not quite</font>

747
00:32:41,289 --> 00:32:46,840
paired up there quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not</font>

748
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:49,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">pairing up as well as as we'd expect so</font>

749
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:51,610
once again there's both that balance of

750
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:53,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">Technology and leadership but then of</font>

751
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:55,449
course there's a hell of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more</font>

752
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:58,470
complexity to that that we can't exactly

753
00:32:55,450 --> 00:33:01,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">fit into 40 minutes balancing with</font>

754
00:32:58,470 --> 00:33:03,309
external objectives avoiding what I

755
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,460
referred<font color="#CCCCCC"> to before is that self licking</font>

756
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:10,750
ice cream a strategy<font color="#CCCCCC"> of cyber only being</font>

757
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:13,870
for its own benefit how we balance that

758
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:14,250
is going to be be one of the challenges

759
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:16,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">of them</font>

760
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:18,450
three to<font color="#CCCCCC"> five years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is where I</font>

761
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:20,310
start talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about taking those in a</font>

762
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:21,510
video pass that we've already started to

763
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:24,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">see out there that we can use to</font>

764
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:27,510
motivate inspire I suppose where I get

765
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:29,550
up there is that necessity and survival

766
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:31,650
of the mother of innovation and I don't

767
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:34,290
think a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our approaches are</font>

768
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:37,620
harnessing those yet so these are things

769
00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:39,420
that I believe will start to see rise

770
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:43,560
over the next three to five years as

771
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:46,710
this environment starts to change so

772
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:49,379
that's that's all i had in in cyber so

773
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:51,210
guys thanks for having me here and and

774
00:33:49,380 --> 00:34:04,320
listening to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me do we do we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have any</font>

775
00:33:51,210 --> 00:34:06,780
questions there been tidbits of of this

776
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:10,168
rounded so my favorite one is asking<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

777
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:11,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">waters cyber and that starts throw</font>

778
00:34:10,168 --> 00:34:13,080
people off guard and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then there's that</font>

779
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:15,388
thought process<font color="#E5E5E5"> that starts to happen</font>

780
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:18,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay well that's that's probably what we</font>

781
00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:21,990
should be doing so I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a lot of</font>

782
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:25,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">people that sudden stop has actually</font>

783
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:25,759
been being quite valuable for them

784
00:34:42,659 --> 00:35:00,400
so you're saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> that our terms</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

785
00:34:45,820 --> 00:35:01,990
reference odd are inconsistent or as

786
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:06,460
opposed to<font color="#CCCCCC"> going into greater depth on</font>

787
00:35:01,990 --> 00:35:08,109
other things yep yeah well look you've

788
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:11,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">got to do a 30-second grab when you</font>

789
00:35:08,109 --> 00:35:13,000
start interacting with a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

790
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:14,589
people I mean I'm i come from a

791
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,599
technical background I love going on a

792
00:35:14,589 --> 00:35:19,690
really really deep dive on on a subject

793
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:22,030
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people don't have and as you</font>

794
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:23,800
quite rightly put a lot of people don't

795
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:25,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the desire</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go to that depth and</font>

796
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:32,880
therefore yet we<font color="#E5E5E5"> immediately jump to</font>

797
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:32,879
Sylar so yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> fair point</font>

798
00:35:36,460 --> 00:36:17,150
any more questions yes yep<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so I'll</font>

799
00:36:15,619 --> 00:36:18,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">throw another one into their we've we've</font>

800
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:20,680
just talked about our information

801
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:23,000
infrastructure does that<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

802
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,710
incorporate our control systems

803
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:28,119
infrastructure that's not necessarily in

804
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:30,350
an information element but that there's

805
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,730
does that feature in there as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

806
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:33,770
these then start to become the

807
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:35,240
complexities we start throwing to this I

808
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:38,000
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case of we</font>

809
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:40,368
immediately make that jump<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I think</font>

810
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:43,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more so over time we start</font>

811
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:46,310
establishing what we're talking about

812
00:36:43,790 --> 00:36:47,810
and this I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still something</font>

813
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:49,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is evolving I guess that's the</font>

814
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:55,220
point I've tried to draw out there is

815
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:57,920
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean Navy's Navy's themselves</font>

816
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:59,600
will even formed wheel trees took

817
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:02,480
several worm you know took<font color="#E5E5E5"> several</font>

818
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,520
hundred years to evolve as did a<font color="#CCCCCC"> navy</font>

819
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,190
that was dedicated purely to the defense

820
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:09,770
of the nation's maritime interests so

821
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:14,480
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suppose we're still in that</font>

822
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:16,430
forming stage interesting interesting

823
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,990
sort of point but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's a case of</font>

824
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:21,790
yet it took time to evolve and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font>

825
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:21,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">we'll take time to evolve that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

826
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:59,899
Ben you sure yep sorry were there any

827
00:37:53,930 --> 00:38:01,399
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions thanks for listening</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

828
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,690
and staying around i'll be here

829
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,339
throughout<font color="#CCCCCC"> the conference if you wanted</font>

830
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:07,329
any if you want to ask me anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>
