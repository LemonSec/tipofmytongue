little bit about my background but

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,439
before<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I hope that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys get a</font>

lot out of the talk I really enjoyed

36
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:41,189
researching it and found out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">things that I'm just really passionate</font>

about this subject and I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it</font>

39
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,180
proves to be valuable for you guys so a

00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,470
little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my background</font>

41
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:52,409
worked for the virus cert and instant

42
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:55,399
response within IBM then I was in MSS

43
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:59,729
architect at a couple organizations and

44
00:01:55,399 --> 00:02:01,860
my last and prior to this position made

45
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:03,630
a foray into more of the sales side and

46
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,189
that was a bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mistake and so now</font>

47
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:08,280
I'm back into the technical side of

48
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,508
things and so realize I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not</font>

49
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,568
my<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

52
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:16,569
overview of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I'm going to be</font>

53
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:19,480
covering<font color="#CCCCCC"> today first going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

54
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:22,899
hunting then I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about the</font>

55
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:25,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">sim gap and ways that you know we can</font>

56
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,129
cover that and then also talking about

57
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:29,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">the problem with hunting and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

58
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:31,810
solution and talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about unknowns and how</font>

59
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,629
to turn them into knowns and then I'll

60
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:37,629
wrap it<font color="#CCCCCC"> all up hopefully</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> give you guys</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

61
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:39,790
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> time for questions but i'll be at</font>

62
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:41,439
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> booth at fire mon if you guys have</font>

63
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:45,010
any questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> afterwards or want to see</font>

64
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:47,769
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> later so what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is hunting this</font>

65
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:49,209
is kind of a new term and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

66
00:02:47,769 --> 00:02:51,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">afraid it's become a little bit of a</font>

67
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:54,340
buzz word but it actually is quite

68
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:56,048
important it's a proactive versus

69
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:59,079
reactive approach to identify an

70
00:02:56,049 --> 00:03:02,319
incidence you know the reactive side of

71
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:04,540
it is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> notification comes in you</font>

72
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,668
receive that<font color="#E5E5E5"> notification and that's</font>

73
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:09,219
when your incident starts and that's how

74
00:03:06,669 --> 00:03:12,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot of organizations work or even</font>

75
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:14,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">worse they get a call from maybe a</font>

76
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:16,870
three-letter agency or somebody else

77
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,159
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and they realize they've been</font>

78
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:20,889
compromised<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the incident</font>

79
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,439
starts so the proactive side of it is

80
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:25,870
actively looking for incidents and using

81
00:03:23,439 --> 00:03:29,108
things like patterns intelligence or

82
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:31,540
even hunches to find information within

83
00:03:29,109 --> 00:03:37,329
your data and finding threats up before

84
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:40,298
you have to react so there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

85
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:43,060
of recent work basing like defining

86
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:46,329
hunting and one of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this</font>

87
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:48,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular model a hunting maturity</font>

88
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:50,169
model let's put together by a David

89
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:53,738
Bianco<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'm not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go through</font>

90
00:03:50,169 --> 00:03:56,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">each step but needless to say the one on</font>

91
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:59,439
the far left there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the basic you know</font>

92
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:02,109
not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing any hunting which a lot</font>

93
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,709
of organizations are facing today now

94
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:07,840
there's three factors that contribute to

95
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:10,169
moving forward<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that hunting maturity</font>

96
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,669
model one of them is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> quality of data</font>

97
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:15,280
is a lot of you realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know from</font>

98
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:17,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">the sim world and you know log</font>

99
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,048
management the more data the better

100
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:24,040
although<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of us have recognized</font>

101
00:04:20,048 --> 00:04:25,810
that as you get more data

102
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,370
you can get higher bills from your sim

103
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:29,560
vendor which that can be a problem as

104
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:32,290
well so then a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shift is now</font>

105
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:33,760
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> been you know quality so you</font>

106
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:36,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">know there's a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of a balance</font>

107
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,990
their tools provided to access and

108
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:39,220
analyze<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data and so that's that's</font>

109
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,970
another component that I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

110
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:44,770
about priests quite a bit today is ways

111
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:47,920
that you can access<font color="#E5E5E5"> data rapidly and</font>

112
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:49,090
perform analysis rapidly because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

113
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:51,240
get to this a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little later but in my</font>

114
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:55,210
opinion soon is not well suited for

115
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:56,830
rapid data analysis and triage and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

116
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:58,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">finally of course the skills of the</font>

117
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:01,450
analysts<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are using the data and</font>

118
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:03,970
actually doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hunting and there's</font>

119
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:06,400
several maturity indicators so you know

120
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:10,270
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interest of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time and not reading</font>

121
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,429
every single line here threat Intel is

122
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:15,700
one of the early indicators of hunting

123
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:17,470
maturity data analysis procedures and

124
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,390
processes having those in place that's

125
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:22,660
another maturity indicator further down

126
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:24,640
the line and finally one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more you</font>

127
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:27,040
know essentially the far right that<font color="#E5E5E5"> hmm</font>

128
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:32,440
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> is tying automation in with your</font>

129
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:35,200
hunting as much as possible so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

130
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:38,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">the talk is about security analytics I'm</font>

131
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,840
just a solutions architect from fire

132
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:42,969
Mont so but let me you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know refer to</font>

133
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:46,210
some experts Gartner just referred

134
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:47,590
released a paper in April about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

135
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:51,580
fast-evolving state of security

136
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:53,229
analytics and essentially the<font color="#CCCCCC"> are bein</font>

137
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,849
they are being integrated because rule

138
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:57,820
and signature based prevention systems

139
00:05:54,850 --> 00:06:00,280
and tuning processes are not doing a

140
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:02,950
good job of stopping or preventing

141
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,500
breaches and we'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into some</font>

142
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:08,710
elements here that can<font color="#CCCCCC"> help change that</font>

143
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:12,970
using security analytics so what's the

144
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:15,430
definition of the sim gap but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

145
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:17,110
with sim I'm a big fan of sim in my

146
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,090
history<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've done a lot of work with him</font>

147
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:21,460
I still continue<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do work with sim and</font>

148
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:25,510
I'm not suggesting that tomb goes away

149
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:27,669
by any means but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing with sim</font>

150
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:29,920
today is that it was designed the best

151
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:32,230
it could around<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago with the</font>

152
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">technology of the day so the advantage</font>

153
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:36,090
that security analytics has today is

154
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">there have been a lot of improvements in</font>

155
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:40,130
virtualization in

156
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:42,380
processing power in database

157
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:43,880
technologies so you know we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

158
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,310
familiar with Hadoop<font color="#E5E5E5"> and elastic search</font>

159
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,950
and those types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of technologies that</font>

160
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:52,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really created that a better way to</font>

161
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:54,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">access data and to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more data so sim</font>

162
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:56,420
is designed for the known you can

163
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:58,910
normalize in<font color="#E5E5E5"> partial logs that are</font>

164
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:00,500
defined<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's the compatibility</font>

165
00:06:58,910 --> 00:07:02,750
you know your sim has to have you know

166
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,160
an idea of what this log looks like so

167
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,830
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> can put it in the right buckets for</font>

168
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,230
analysis the alerts are based on policy

169
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:10,909
so essentially known right you have to

170
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:13,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">know that something's coming to make</font>

171
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:16,880
this machine smart the reporting is

172
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:19,039
predefined and there's automated data

173
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,040
analysis by the system which is

174
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:23,570
essentially designed to be mostly hands

175
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,980
off from the human right you spend a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

176
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:27,590
of time doing tuning and setting up

177
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:30,020
alerts and all of this work and the idea

178
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:32,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the machine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will go through those</font>

179
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,159
vast quantities of data and create

180
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:36,049
output which are alert and then you can

181
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">go in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and triage and investigate those</font>

182
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:41,180
alerts but what that boils down to is if

183
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:43,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's not a rule a policy a report or</font>

184
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:46,700
an alert nothing is detected by the sim

185
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,980
so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really designed for human</font>

186
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:51,170
interaction and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kind of what</font>

187
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,730
I'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into here moving forward so I</font>

188
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:57,410
know it's a couple other perspectives

189
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:59,570
here related to sim<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gartner challenges</font>

190
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:01,580
complexity a lot of performance limits

191
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:04,340
data variety challenges so we talked

192
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,990
about parsing a lot of new environments

193
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:08,719
coming up and then the analysis where is

194
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:10,610
the analysis and the sim component ESG

195
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,410
group requires advanced skills and

196
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:14,510
knowledge big<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with sim right I</font>

197
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,100
bet a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you folks have sim and you</font>

198
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,659
probably have one two maybe three

199
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,700
individuals maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple more if</font>

200
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:22,060
you're really<font color="#E5E5E5"> advanced organization that</font>

201
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,500
understand how to utilize<font color="#CCCCCC"> assume and</font>

202
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:27,560
what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> does is it creates a gateway</font>

203
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,510
or barrier to access to data the

204
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,220
advantage of security analytics is it

205
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,650
allows more people to access the data

206
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:35,510
quicker which then allows you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

207
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:36,709
better analysis with more people that

208
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:40,939
have intelligence about your business

209
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:43,190
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at things so let's take a look</font>

210
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:45,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">at the evolution of data analysis I've</font>

211
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">been doing some demos at the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> firemen</font>

212
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:49,970
booth and a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people you know</font>

213
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">comment that hey it looks like swamp and</font>

214
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's very</font>

215
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,689
true in a lot of ways in terms of the

216
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:56,029
security analytics technologies out

217
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:58,100
there today but<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's some differences</font>

218
00:08:56,029 --> 00:09:00,410
right so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things with</font>

219
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:03,440
analytics of course is using the

220
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:05,300
analytics components to actually bubble

221
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,029
up the unknown data within your

222
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,079
environment and and the interesting data

223
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:10,699
so you can find those things you have

224
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:13,130
that intelligence you understand what's

225
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:15,290
right and what's wrong so you know just

226
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:18,110
moving through this right<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

227
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:20,420
structured data example products things

228
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:21,920
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> ArcSight visualization was a big</font>

229
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,750
thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> came along with splunk and</font>

230
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:25,430
then you have your data scientists that

231
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,139
really love to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> into that reg ex was</font>

232
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:30,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">Blanc and query and do a lot of great</font>

233
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:32,300
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> splunk is awesome and now what</font>

234
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:34,519
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing here with security analytics</font>

235
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:35,810
is helping discover the unknown because

236
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:37,790
that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the gaps</font>

237
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,829
out there right now is there's so many

238
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:41,599
products you've got ideas you've got any

239
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:42,739
virus you get sim they're there they're

240
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,510
telling you what's known in your

241
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:47,000
environment and when it's happening so

242
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:49,339
how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find the unknown now I talk</font>

243
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,320
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> hunting like yeah</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's all start</font>

244
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:54,290
hunting we can all do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's a lot</font>

245
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:58,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">of experts Anton at Gartner being one of</font>

246
00:09:54,290 --> 00:10:00,290
them that is really bullish on the fact

247
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:02,779
that hunting<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not something that</font>

248
00:10:00,290 --> 00:10:05,240
everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do it's a very one</font>

249
00:10:02,779 --> 00:10:07,640
percenter so to speak activity that only

250
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,949
the experts of experts can effectively

251
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:12,140
hunt one of the elements that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font>

252
00:10:09,949 --> 00:10:14,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about here is the most</font>

253
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:17,750
sophisticated analytic<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the planet</font>

254
00:10:14,529 --> 00:10:19,579
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> your mind so we're going to</font>

255
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,949
focus on the human layer of analysis and

256
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:23,269
using analytics to really get into your

257
00:10:21,949 --> 00:10:27,170
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and find the unknown</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font>

258
00:10:23,269 --> 00:10:30,519
unusual so the shift<font color="#CCCCCC"> from known to</font>

259
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:33,529
unknown is pretty difficult to

260
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:36,290
comprehend I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> only been at firearm on</font>

261
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:38,329
for about six months and it's been a

262
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:40,490
journey for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me as being a sim person at</font>

263
00:10:38,329 --> 00:10:43,339
the start and<font color="#E5E5E5"> having to learn really</font>

264
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">this gap exists so you have your no one</font>

265
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:46,639
on the left and this to me really

266
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:49,040
represents the sim you're reporting on

267
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,230
answers so you essentially collect data

268
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:54,079
to answer those questions so that's part

269
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:55,399
of that known and structured side and at

270
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,310
the start you're developing a list of

271
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:00,199
questions so you know what questions do

272
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:01,910
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask let's get my data for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

273
00:11:00,199 --> 00:11:04,040
and then let's report on the answers to

274
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:06,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">doubt those questions</font>

275
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:08,899
going to the unknown side you have no

276
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,290
list of questions you collect everything

277
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:14,120
and you use analytics to explore the

278
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:16,969
data and discover things in your

279
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,339
environment and the important thing with

280
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:21,800
security analytics working is it has to

281
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:23,990
be easy it has to be fast because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

282
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,880
needs to encourage curiosity and

283
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:28,220
exploration within your data you find an

284
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,139
anomaly you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't click on something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

285
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:31,519
have to go make a sandwich to wait for

286
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:33,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">the result it has to be very rapid</font>

287
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:37,459
otherwise you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to want to</font>

288
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:38,750
explore as you'll be penalized so let's

289
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:40,729
talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some techniques for the</font>

290
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:43,160
unknown<font color="#CCCCCC"> that security analytics brings</font>

291
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:44,899
to the table so machine learning is

292
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:47,269
another big<font color="#CCCCCC"> buzz word that's been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

293
00:11:44,899 --> 00:11:48,649
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> throwing around out there and when</font>

294
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:50,389
you're working with large data sets

295
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:51,920
whether it's you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last hours</font>

296
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:53,569
worth of data the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> day's worth of</font>

297
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,939
data or you're just working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a large</font>

298
00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:58,459
packet capture how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you possibly</font>

299
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,870
analyze that file rapidly and one of the

300
00:11:58,459 --> 00:12:02,420
technologies that's out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is event</font>

301
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:04,819
clustering event clustering takes the

302
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:06,769
commonality of all the data from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

303
00:12:04,819 --> 00:12:09,769
period<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're evaluating so say</font>

304
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:11,750
it's the last hour and it puts those

305
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:14,959
into buckets so essentially you're able

306
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:17,630
to see you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a million logs it</font>

307
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:19,719
might put it into a<font color="#CCCCCC"> twenty line bucket</font>

308
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:22,519
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the different variants on those logs</font>

309
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:23,660
then you can see what's unique and

310
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:26,269
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> within that by clicking</font>

311
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:28,760
through and evaluating that information

312
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:30,319
so event clusters is a great way to kind

313
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:34,130
of find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the unknown within large data</font>

00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:36,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">sets another component is Association</font>

315
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:38,870
analytics exploring frequency in your

316
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,610
data in different categories so looking

317
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:44,630
at frequent and infrequent information

318
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:47,149
in areas like IP address taking a look

319
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:49,189
at geo-located data and showing you that

320
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:50,990
ranked frequent and infrequent so for

321
00:12:49,189 --> 00:12:53,449
example look at the infrequent

322
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:54,740
geolocation information about you know

323
00:12:53,449 --> 00:12:56,839
countries<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you may not do business</font>

324
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">with or just countries that you don't</font>

325
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:00,290
know why they're in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your data you can</font>

326
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:01,939
click<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it and it's certainly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not a</font>

327
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:04,099
smoking gun but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a way for you to</font>

328
00:13:01,939 --> 00:13:07,670
quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> and rapidly analyze something</font>

329
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:09,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">and find something interesting activity</font>

330
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:11,420
and change so compare data sets and

331
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:14,600
timeframes for differences so what's

332
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:16,819
trending up what's trending down what's

333
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,720
new which is a huge element right so if

334
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:19,790
I'm looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at my date</font>

335
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,649
set and I'm saying what's new in my data

336
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:23,360
since yesterday that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very powerful</font>

337
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:25,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">because why is something new in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

338
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,689
environment did something go wrong did

339
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:29,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">something break do I have a duplex</font>

340
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:31,639
issues there a this configuration or is

341
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:33,378
there something else<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong so why is it</font>

342
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:36,920
new why is it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my environment and what</font>

343
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:38,360
is it so you can quickly use your user

344
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:41,719
brain to analyze that and find out if

345
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:44,540
it's legitimate another element is a

346
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:47,660
cohort analysis so you can essentially

347
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:50,689
say guilt by association right so you're

348
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:52,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">taking a look at a piece of data and you</font>

349
00:13:50,689 --> 00:13:54,649
might have some suspicions about that

350
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:56,060
piece<font color="#CCCCCC"> of data similarly to you know</font>

351
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:57,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">somebody robs a bank you're going to go</font>

352
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,508
talk to their family and their friends

353
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:00,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">and see if there's some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of you know</font>

355
00:14:00,889 --> 00:14:05,930
and you know so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to take a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">some suspicions about and see where else</font>

358
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:12,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">and interacting in your data so speaking</font>

359
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:15,109
of that in one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the big ways that</font>

360
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:17,359
we're able to really take a look and

361
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:19,699
visualize data is you know using<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

362
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,430
eyes to to do that visualization<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

363
00:14:19,699 --> 00:14:25,099
prospective analysis so look at things

364
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:26,719
find the outliers and explore so with

365
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,069
the geolocation data of course you've

366
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">got a map which shows you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all these</font>

367
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:32,479
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> areas that your your data is</font>

368
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,949
involved in being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to click around</font>

369
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:37,309
being able to find interesting things

370
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:38,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's very powerful then of course taking</font>

371
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:39,800
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at things that are happening in</font>

real<font color="#CCCCCC"> time streaming into your</font>

373
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,949
environment along with the search you

374
00:14:41,329 --> 00:14:44,750
know the search represents the past and

375
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:47,240
then you have the real time coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

376
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,680
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> anytime any kind of data that</font>

377
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,240
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at just seeing how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

378
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,979
data looks for that period that you're

379
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,569
evaluating and see if there's blips or

380
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,370
other interesting things like for

381
00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:57,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">example if you're looking at a user that</font>

382
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:00,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">typically works 9 a.m. to five and a</font>

383
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:01,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain time zone and there is activity</font>

384
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:03,258
that's happening every 15 minutes

385
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,610
throughout the entire day you know you

386
00:15:03,259 --> 00:15:06,050
may be looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> some kind of automated</font>

387
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:07,550
process or something like that that's

388
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:09,649
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can pick out fairly</font>

389
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:14,019
easily easily using visualizations so

390
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:17,629
that's where that can be valuable<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

391
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:19,220
finally well not<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally but natural</font>

392
00:15:17,629 --> 00:15:22,129
language processing is actually a really

393
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:24,769
big component to this as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

394
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:27,319
the search has to be very easy it has to

395
00:15:24,769 --> 00:15:29,509
be something that's Google like it's

396
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:31,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">easy to use anyone can use it and the</font>

397
00:15:29,509 --> 00:15:34,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">idea behind it is to make</font>

398
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:36,390
or go to first for<font color="#E5E5E5"> your IT data right so</font>

399
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:39,369
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's say let's use an example</font>

400
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:41,890
you know we all have vehicles of some

401
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:43,810
sort if something is wrong with that

402
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:46,149
vehicle whether it's a car scooter a

403
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:47,979
bike whatever it is we might go to

404
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:49,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google put in the make and model or</font>

405
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,690
other information about that particular

406
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:54,010
vehicle and Google is going to give us

407
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">information about it right the</font>

408
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:57,910
manufacturer website places where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

409
00:15:55,899 --> 00:16:00,220
can get it repaired and other

410
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,600
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know somehow it</font>

411
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:04,029
just seems magical right because it's

412
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,560
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> all very relevant and you might be</font>

413
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:07,300
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find you know parts and all</font>

414
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,430
those types of things and that's the

415
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">same idea behind security analytics is</font>

416
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:13,719
when you do a search whether it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> for an</font>

417
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:16,149
IP or a term you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know putting in just a</font>

418
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,959
word dropped or you know blocked or

419
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:21,760
flopping you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get data that is related</font>

420
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:23,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">to your search and then you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use the</font>

421
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,170
analytics to find other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things and</font>

422
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:28,329
because security<font color="#E5E5E5"> analytics is very good</font>

423
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:31,510
at taking in any kind of data any human

424
00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:33,550
readable data there has to be a way that

425
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:35,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">natural language processing is applied</font>

426
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:38,020
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that data so it can infer what's</font>

427
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:41,320
happening so using<font color="#CCCCCC"> verbs you know</font>

actions<font color="#CCCCCC"> seem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> allow deny block fail you</font>

430
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:47,770
subjects so addresses and usernames

431
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:50,680
proper nouns various other parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

432
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:52,180
speech that can add nuance to the log

433
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,339
and really help you understand what's

434
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:55,660
happening and it's got to be fuzzy and

435
00:16:54,339 --> 00:16:58,930
there has to be that that metadata

436
00:16:55,660 --> 00:17:02,319
that's there that adds that extra layer

437
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:04,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">of enrichment and so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know unlike sim</font>

438
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">the idea is to have just a giant</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bucket</font>

439
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:10,990
we're all data that you're bringing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

440
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:13,540
is searchable every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single bit of it so</font>

441
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:16,150
another component we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

442
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:17,678
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get in all the data this is</font>

443
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">another important part of it so you have</font>

444
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,579
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to take in all the data so</font>

445
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:23,290
support for clustering for<font color="#E5E5E5"> big data and</font>

446
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:26,020
also<font color="#CCCCCC"> Federation to eliminate data</font>

447
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:28,030
politics is very important the data

448
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:30,850
politics angle is what I mentioned

449
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:32,649
earlier where you talk about sim and you

450
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:34,899
know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's usually a handful of</font>

451
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:37,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">individuals that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have access to sim and</font>

452
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,250
have expertise eliminating that and

453
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,690
allowing<font color="#CCCCCC"> more people have access to the</font>

454
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,490
data will allow you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find more things</font>

455
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:44,620
in your environment and find more issues

456
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,840
and problems

457
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:50,409
you've got to have the flexible

458
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:51,669
real-time data collection so all the

459
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:54,610
kind of things that you're used to write

460
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:56,860
your you know syslog<font color="#CCCCCC"> netflow all those</font>

461
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:59,169
types of things but even go further

462
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:02,439
streaming packet capture is a great

463
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:04,720
capability any TCP UDP port you can

<font color="#E5E5E5">literally net Pat data over you can do</font>

465
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,840

466
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,630
system will take it in and you can

467
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,129
create as<font color="#CCCCCC"> many collectors that you want</font>

468
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:14,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">really as many collectors as there are</font>

469
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:15,790
ports and with those collectors you can

470
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:17,350
define the different repositories you

471
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:19,750
can define the time-to-live of that data

security analytics<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and sim or any</font>

00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:24,100
analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to be able to do</font>

501
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:25,750
collaboration right everyone's working

502
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,580
as a team<font color="#CCCCCC"> so within the data you have to</font>

503
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:29,260
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do things one of the things</font>

504
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,939
is pinboard technology which is you take

505
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,470
all the different queries that you're

506
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:34,179
running or things that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are commonly</font>

507
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:35,590
looking at and you can actually tag

508
00:19:34,179 --> 00:19:37,090
those queries and place them on a pin

509
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:38,439
board and then revisit them and share

510
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:40,899
that pin board with other people within

511
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,520
the organization and then do tagging a

512
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:44,320
note so you can create automatic tags

513
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:47,559
based on a profile of a piece of data

514
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,659
you can add notes manually like you're

515
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:51,670
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom of the screen and just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> add</font>

516
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,110
something very quickly that refers to

517
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:54,730
what you discovered and that you're

518
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:58,570
investigating or that you know something

519
00:19:54,730 --> 00:20:00,279
is related to it and then you have

520
00:19:58,570 --> 00:20:02,049
going further in more advanced as we're

521
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:04,179
moving down the scale for hunting

522
00:20:02,049 --> 00:20:07,120
maturity the automation side of things

523
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:09,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">so workflow create repeatable processes</font>

524
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,289
within your data essentially whiteboard

525
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:12,969
something with your<font color="#CCCCCC"> business analyst and</font>

526
00:20:11,289 --> 00:20:14,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">then map that within your data of</font>

527
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:16,600
something that's repeatable<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

528
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:19,449
will happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then also the remote</font>

529
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,070
capability so being able to shell script

530
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:23,710
things and run things in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a repeatable</font>

531
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:25,178
basis so agent-based functionality for

532
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,620
example in you all of your remote

533
00:20:25,179 --> 00:20:29,049
networks you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have an agent that will</font>

534
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:30,729
do packet capture on demand or<font color="#E5E5E5"> will run</font>

535
00:20:29,049 --> 00:20:32,289
things like netstat so if certain things

536
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">happen in your environment have</font>

537
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:35,679
different scripts run automatically so

538
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:37,210
when you go in<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that triage in that</font>

539
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,679
investigation the data is waiting for

540
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:42,669
you in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system there's no need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

541
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:44,620
it so that's why i believe security

542
00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:45,909
analytics is a path to hunting maturity

543
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:48,129
here are a few different<font color="#CCCCCC"> use cases</font>

544
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:50,259
you've got your data accessibility

545
00:20:48,129 --> 00:20:53,139
discover from you know more data

546
00:20:50,259 --> 00:20:56,649
grabbing log files packet captures as

547
00:20:53,139 --> 00:20:58,658
easy as uploading into<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dropbox incident</font>

548
00:20:56,649 --> 00:21:00,610
response so find<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the incident</font>

549
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:02,830
context drag log files from multiple

550
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:04,750
sources into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system retain the</font>

551
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:08,139
original date and create time correlated

552
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:10,779
views rapid event triage so discovering

553
00:21:08,139 --> 00:21:13,209
the cause automatically correlate alerts

554
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:15,250
and human data with automatically enrich

555
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,210
infrastructure data that geolocation<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

556
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,830
other different metadata that's

557
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:20,559
automatically added<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the system and</font>

558
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:23,049
hunting discovering the unknown so the

559
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea that you're searching for things</font>

560
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:26,470
that are just potentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> high-risk</font>

561
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:28,029
different characteristics that you're

562
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:30,700
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that may indicate</font>

563
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:36,450
something so kind of wrapping things up

564
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:39,580
here how<font color="#E5E5E5"> long did that go oh pretty good</font>

565
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:42,370
so let's let's take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this</font>

566
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:44,259
hunting maturity model again and just

567
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:46,059
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of review some of the things that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

568
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:48,250
talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> here so you talked about</font>

569
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:49,840
the more data the better so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font>

570
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:51,970
idea security analytics<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can bring in</font>

571
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,850
as much as you want with big data tools

00:21:53,850 --> 00:22:00,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">ease of use security analytics brings</font>

574
00:21:56,649 --> 00:22:01,299
that to the table the skills that's

575
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that you guys will have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>
