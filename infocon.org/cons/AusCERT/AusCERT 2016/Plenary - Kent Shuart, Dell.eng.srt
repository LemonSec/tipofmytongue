<font color="#E5E5E5">take a very different look that you may</font>

20
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:02,390
have taken in terms of malware if we

21
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:04,190
look at malware as a business it's an

22
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:09,290
interesting little report we can find

23
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:11,600
out and so let's see you up there we are

24
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:13,570
so what I want to do is start talking

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the malware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Inc annual report and</font>

26
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:19,460
this is a perspective that I think we

27
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:20,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">all can can learn from as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well as get an</font>

28
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:23,089
understanding as to where people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

29
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:24,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">going and what they're thinking in the</font>

30
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,420
terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the letter to the shareholders</font>

31
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,160
in terms of what malware<font color="#E5E5E5"> Inc would be</font>

32
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,119
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you it's been a great</font>

33
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:33,950
year that's why that fills this room

34
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,929
it's also showing great opportunity

35
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:37,520
great chances of growth a lot of new

36
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,740
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are going on this is a</font>

37
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">wonderful thing from malware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Inc this</font>

38
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,958
year and we break this down let's take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

39
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:46,789
highlight on the business costs are

40
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:49,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">going down according to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> symantec the</font>

41
00:01:46,789 --> 00:01:52,459
total number of breaches from 2014 2

42
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,340
2015 went down slightly so we've got

43
00:01:52,459 --> 00:01:56,959
costs in line the good news is as

44
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,970
revenues are up because the total

45
00:01:56,959 --> 00:02:03,170
identities breach goes up has gone up

46
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:06,619
substantially so what we have are fewer

47
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:08,869
attacks more breaches and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that's</font>

48
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:11,720
going to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing itself in terms of</font>

00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:13,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">a trend isn't in the coming year or so</font>

50
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,700
but we're on track for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a good year in</font>

51
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,079
2016 as i'm sure you all know from what

52
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:22,099
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been seeing in the news in the</font>

53
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,840
last few weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next thing is there's</font>

54
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:26,209
a lot of new products out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean</font>

55
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">think of a business the business grows</font>

00:02:26,209 --> 00:02:30,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">or business</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thrives on new products</font>

57
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:32,030
there's an explosion<font color="#CCCCCC"> of new malware</font>

58
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:33,799
types of variants that are out there

59
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,180
take the old product put a<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

60
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,740
color on it and send it out there

61
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,500
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be noticed and</font>

62
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,970
identified we're also going to create a

63
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,620
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> new products the big new</font>

64
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,690
product is mobile

65
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,980
and you start<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at I look through</font>

66
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:48,620
this audience here and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would imagine</font>

67
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:50,959
that less than half probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> less than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

68
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,659
quarter of you are running some sort of

69
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">anti malware on your phone so we're</font>

70
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:57,079
creating venues in which we can be

71
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,819
connected to the internet but we're

72
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,790
leaving windows open that will allow us

73
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:05,619
to get into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network and compromise</font>

74
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:08,328
it and create some sort of vulnerability

75
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,700
this is sort of an interesting slide and

76
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:14,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">I picked this out of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the secure works a</font>

77
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:17,149
report that just came out in April and I

78
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:19,129
really like the fact that the cost of

79
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">MasterCard and Visa and stolen in</font>

quantities has gone down it was about

81
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:26,329
eight fifty nine dollars last year so

82
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:28,489
now we're seeing some economies of scale

83
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:31,220
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> in because so many MasterCard and</font>

100
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:11,480
interesting because exploit kits for the

updates and if you pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for additional</font>

106
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:23,810
forty dollars will give you tutorials on

real<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting little development in</font>

110
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms of where the software's going then</font>

111
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,840
you start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at any identity kids</font>

112
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:38,150
passports and things like that they're

113
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,448
<font color="#CCCCCC">all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> place the market is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

114
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:43,909
wonderful if you're malware<font color="#CCCCCC"> ink so</font>

115
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:48,139
here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> my conclusion malware's big</font>

116
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:49,880
business it's growing<font color="#CCCCCC"> like crazy we need</font>

117
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:51,890
to do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that because they</font>

118
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,420
have very sophisticated business models

119
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:57,000
I would liken the cost

120
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,770
business model of microsoft<font color="#E5E5E5"> office to</font>

121
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,390
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost and business model of the most</font>

122
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:03,659
sophisticated malware out there right

123
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:06,120
now so you start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at malware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Inc</font>

124
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:10,050
they're learning from us and really

125
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:13,500
growing their business everyone does in

126
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,120
a threat summary a threat report<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not</font>

127
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to go into those details I mean</font>

128
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,260
there's one I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> dell obviously has</font>

one<font color="#CCCCCC"> symantec i quoted mandiant has one</font>

00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:26,190
everybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> seems to have some sort of</font>

131
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:28,170
insight on what's going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the market</font>

132
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:31,440
what I want to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at is the conclusion</font>

133
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:33,000
and the conclusions on this that I've

134
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,610
been gaining from looking at many

135
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,560
different types of threat reports is the

136
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:40,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">first thing is is that when I was in a</font>

137
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:43,350
meeting last week where someone stood on

138

the stage and said for most of you here

able to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to hide things well</font>

143
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:00,840
that's a great statement if you're in

144
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,840
malware business because your firewall

145
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:06,270
most likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> does not inspect encrypted</font>

146
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,549
elements in fact it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

147
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:11,039
computationally intensive effort in

148
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:13,500
order to decrypt a file which lowers the

149
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,850
throughput of a firewall which reduces

150
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,400
the need that people are going to say

151
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:18,840
wait a<font color="#CCCCCC"> minute I don't want to use this</font>

152
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,880
fight this feature of the firewall

153
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,349
because it slows my network down but let

154
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,450
me give you a different perspective on

155
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:26,490
that the perspective on that that I

156
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:29,909
would contend with is you didn't know

157
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:33,000
that malware encrypted in a file with

158
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:34,860
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> you needed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to put me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to scope</font>

159
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,260
for when you purchase your firewall you

160
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:39,650
bought too small of a firewall you can't

161
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:42,719
handle the decryption capabilities

162
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:45,109
mobile attacks very straightforward as i

163
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:47,970
mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> anti-malware on your phone and</font>

164
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:50,040
finally if you're going to be good at

165
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:51,870
building malware and now we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> ink is</font>

166
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,580
really looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> for these sort of people</font>

167
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:56,310
you're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be good at building</font>

168
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,599
evasion techniques and there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

169
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">different techniques</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are out there</font>

170
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">that are designed to get around firewall</font>

171
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">and get around</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to texting and hide</font>

172
00:07:01,350 --> 00:07:06,270
yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> or obfuscated what you're doing</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">within an internet work in order to</font>

174
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,799
allow you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do the bad things you want</font>

177
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:16,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">is the slide you got to be worried about</font>

178
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:19,860
and that is behaviors are changing as a

179
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:23,099
result<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the eroding confidence that is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">being experienced by end users I tell</font>

they're graded moving money around but

184
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,919
they're horrible in terms of protecting

185
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:36,389
yourselves when someone asked me what's

186
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:38,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">the one thing I need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> protect myself</font>

189

roading confidence our ability to

192
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:53,069
as we heard from Kane about AI there's

193
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,900
things you do on on the web doesn't

197
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:05,250
say let's stop using the web for many

198
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:08,219
things so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea behind this and the</font>

199
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:10,919
idea behind malware<font color="#CCCCCC"> ink is it's changing</font>

200
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:12,930
the culture it's changing our behaviors

00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:14,490
in terms of what we want to do and<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

couple predictions one and this was so

205
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:24,990
obvious ransomware is going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

206
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,419
the bonanza for anyone who really wants

00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:34,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">are only a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different variances of</font>

ransomware out on the marketplace now

00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:42,000
there are hundreds in 2016 in the first

212
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:45,689
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the first three</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> months</font>

213
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:48,089
of 2016 is that you see AG explosion of

00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:51,570
malware variants even<font color="#E5E5E5"> from what happened</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">in the previous year so Maseo ransomware</font>

you can do is your education will allows

pretty interesting you cuts down the

the network chances are they say yes if

332
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:39,730
passwords and privileged accounts are

333
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:42,040
not audited and secured the ability to

334
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:45,010
get in and and capture those privileged

335
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:46,510
accounts becomes a lot easier so the

discipline and<font color="#E5E5E5"> passwords is not</font>

individual

338
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:52,689
discipline it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the discipline of really</font>

339
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:54,760
privileged to count passwords so you can

340
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:57,340
audit and track those and finally the

341
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:00,580
thing I hate the most about is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pat</font>

342
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:02,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">are patches more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> often than not in my</font>

morning and<font color="#E5E5E5"> walk into my office is my</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">complete computer screen is out of</font>

346
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:11,709
standstill because it stops every time

347
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:14,229
it reboots because I've got a strange

348
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:15,910
configuration that's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> an indicator</font>

349
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:18,370
to me that I had a patch implemented

350
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:20,199
last night but you got to have patches

351
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:21,550
you got to implement them you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

352
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,620
it you have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the type of</font>

discipline<font color="#CCCCCC"> and policies in place in</font>

354
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:28,360
order to do it what I'm looking at right

355
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,460
here are not hard things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it's</font>

356
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:33,970
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to check on its questions to ask</font>

357
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:37,140
and it's process<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to follow this is a</font>

358
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:39,430
way we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get ahead of malware</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ink I</font>

359
