<font color="#E5E5E5">like somebody a definitely our star wars</font>

20
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,609
I won't talk very quickly and move ahead

21
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:08,189
quite fast to give you a feeling of

22
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:11,040
these years and really to me a return<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

23
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:12,949
where we were almost literally some 40

24
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,080
years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that's got to move ahead</font>

25
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:18,630
yes very quickly think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do about the</font>

26
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,759
way yes there we go oh there's some make

27
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:22,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">some tributes then of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> course there's a</font>

28
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,880
bit of time lining talk about the

29
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:27,210
dimensions of the problem we've got

30
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:30,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">today and tomorrow and then really come</font>

31
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:32,610
to some conclusions very quickly oh by

32
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:35,429
the way you<font color="#E5E5E5"> may wonder what that machine</font>

33
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:38,490
is there and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a I'm not</font>

power it just needs a man handle he's

44
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,520
had the turn of thing it was encrypting

45
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,799
and a good encrypt and decrypt at the

46
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,859
right about one character per second so

47
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:13,770
just turn faster and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do it</font>

48
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:17,730
faster<font color="#E5E5E5"> well anyone for our business</font>

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:19,020
she's here please do remember Queensland

<font color="#E5E5E5">mock-up but that lets a mock-up of it</font>

58
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,060
which of course was run the worst

59

world's first encrypted voice facility

60
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,920
and visit of course was used by McCarver

61
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,920
and the group during the including

just off Queen Street in Brisbane it's

68
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:07,710
open I think wednesday thursday friday

69
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it's well worth for our going in and</font>

70
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:13,140
most recently we were most on about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 15</font>

years ago the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two to be able to</font>

00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,708
recognize you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 300 women who</font>

73
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,940
worked in McCarver's decryption facility

74
00:03:18,709 --> 00:03:23,520
called the Central Bureau here in

75
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:28,320
Brisbane and here is some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the girls</font>

76
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,820
there 15 years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> and indeed they</font>

77
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,459
worked at the Royal Henry she asked

81
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:43,350
quite important then lets us with a

00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:45,780
background<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm also why the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> paid</font>

84
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:51,540
friends dr. Harold Harlan very old

85
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:54,959
friend of mine<font color="#E5E5E5"> Harold was a cipher</font>

86
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:57,660
officer with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the US Navy and he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> worked</font>

on that which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is of course the purple</font>

analog which is the machine<font color="#E5E5E5"> was built</font>

89
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:04,079
this is not a purple machine image

90
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:07,590
appear miss is actually a analog<font color="#E5E5E5"> Horvath</font>

91
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,750
that was made for decrypting the purple

92
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:11,910
intercept why is that rather important

93
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,280
it led to the entry of the United States

94
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:16,890
into World War two so that's why very

95
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,130
important box that's the l a-- log box

96
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:21,329
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to decrypt be the messages</font>

101
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:36,210
nostalgic I like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about some</font>

102
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:39,419
timelines I go make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it over essentially</font>

103
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:41,870
lots of 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> years you'll see quite a few</font>

104
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:44,159
gear i'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the 60s</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">be able to talk with david kahn he</font>

started the whole that crypto Wars a

00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:58,500
long time ago all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> through to</font>

110
00:04:53,969 --> 00:05:02,190
today so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a quick look let's</font>

111
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:04,349
move ahead fast<font color="#E5E5E5"> David can read the first</font>

112
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:07,110
major book published book on

113
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:10,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">code-breaking and is attributed at the</font>

114
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:13,379
time to gaining attention into the whole

115
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:17,340
crypto world with his book the code

116
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:21,169
breakers and he is David's actual terms

117
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:24,659
NSA was not happy not happy Jan

118
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:28,469
definitely at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time indeed they</font>

119
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:30,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">monsturd the publisher to try and revamp</font>

parts of it he<font color="#E5E5E5"> submitted to and they say</font>

121
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,800
it came<font color="#E5E5E5"> back again it was redone a</font>

122
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:37,080
couple of times<font color="#E5E5E5"> and finally was</font>

123
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,629
published as you know David did his PhD

124
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:42,419
at Cambridge University in history and

125
00:05:39,629 --> 00:05:45,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">came again through an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> English publisher</font>

126
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:47,460
but because of a days of your cursor on

127
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,500
the five eyes in the actual fact there

128
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:53,520
was pressure exerted even in the UK at

129
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:55,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">the time so that's interesting indeed we</font>

130
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,650
talk about crypto Wars but in my opinion

131
00:05:55,229 --> 00:06:02,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll call this the first crypto skirmish</font>

132
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:03,870
shall we<font color="#E5E5E5"> but mid-1960s will get me</font>

133
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:10,039
further than that to the same time the

134
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:12,500
data encryption standard 973 NBS<font color="#CCCCCC"> NIST</font>

135
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:16,050
announces the call for ciphers for

136
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:19,729
essentially unclassified but sensitive

137
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:22,110
government and<font color="#E5E5E5"> allied business</font>

138
00:06:19,729 --> 00:06:23,609
cryptography became known as the data

139
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:27,120
encryption stared the first call for

140
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:29,219
ciphers came out in 89 73 and that's

141
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,289
when yours truly got dragged into this

142
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:33,209
by Catholic or control data corporation

143
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:35,400
when I was working in Minneapolis

144
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:37,800
Minnesota and yes it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

145
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:41,008
all in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Minneapolis in midwinter no minus</font>

146
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">50 Fahrenheit you know it's cold but I</font>

147
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:46,280
can't that's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so essentially</font>

148
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:48,840
what happened there as you know

149
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,669
internationalisation of that is rather

150
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,070
interesting there was an attempt at four

151
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:54,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">times with nationalize the data</font>

152
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,759

over time we serve<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a means in France</font>

157
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,930
and also in Europe there was a strong

158
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:15,810
resistance by the united state

159
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:17,550
representatives not to move the DEA into

160
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:19,650
an international standard and I don't

161
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:22,380
forget<font color="#E5E5E5"> even is today interesting enough</font>

162
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:24,419
for those involved we Australians we did

163
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:27,780
standardized if it became Australian

164
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:29,698
stead 2805 dot five so we need to

165
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,880
actually sterilize that but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was never</font>

166
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:34,169
made into an international standard a

167
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,570
bit further on let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a quick look</font>

was Stanford has said hey this was the

to the publisher at the time by NSA to

429
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:27,320

00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:35,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">course it's using a hardware there's</font>

00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:12,510
what's happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> two thousand 2020</font>

00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:19,950
for defense purposes you<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok the problem</font>

449
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,750
we're facing is access to metadata<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,570
I did a quick count one of the best

cryptography courses that<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost you</font>

absolutely nothing is from Coursera it's

487
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,590
offered by Stanford University it's a

488
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:00,809
very advanced course you can do a giftie

489
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:03,360
curve cryptography you could do RSA you

490
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:04,290
can do key management schemes and all

that stuff and<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

if you want papers and qualifications

and certification you can go to Udacity

495

or your Demi and you know pay some money

496

in Udacity you can get some

have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> massive part of impact on policy</font>

00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:34,769
well let's have a quick look a bit

549
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:36,600
further<font color="#E5E5E5"> the dimensions of it I'd like to</font>

defense we have exactly the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

564
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:18,419
so we have a myriad of permutations and

quantum crypto is both a dual use

815
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:46,660
already IBM say it's not just clip

00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:51,700

itself while using quantum cryptography

820
00:36:54,839 --> 00:37:00,730
not just crypt analysis and that's a

say 911 changed the world<font color="#CCCCCC"> Krypto rights</font>

00:37:48,580 --> 00:38:08,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Krypto rights yeah I don't 11</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> yet</font>

839
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:14,890
the question is a month with other

840
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:17,190
people is the balance before balance the

841
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:21,240
world's<font color="#E5E5E5"> change radically changed since</font>

842
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:24,970
2001 we feel 911 the balance between

843
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:27,069
protection detection weather will change

844
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:29,169
where should we stand how do we stand

845
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:31,660
today well they simply know that I'd

846
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:34,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to go back to quite specifically</font>

847
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:36,609
the fact that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet National</font>

848
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:38,410
Information infrastructures in global

849
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:41,260
information infrastructures now

850
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:43,270
critically depend upon upon cryptography

851
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:45,400
we're not going to go away from that so

852
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:48,190
the answer basically is the balance now

853
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:51,250
in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> opinion has to move towards safety</font>

854
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:54,880
and security of our national information

855
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:56,920
infrastructure that must somehow come

856
00:38:54,880 --> 00:39:00,190
first how we get that into our

857
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:03,700
politicians at the same time we're

858
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:05,320
getting the dark side coming in hot and

859
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:08,350
strong as they form themselves into

860
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:10,450
quite literally operational entities as

861
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:13,420
we heard in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the previous talks earlier</font>

862
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:15,310
on today so<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that varies the</font>

863
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:17,080
balance there is a balance most

864
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:20,440
importantly the answer the main question

865
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:22,870
has to be education the problem will I

866
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,340
see basically is that in many<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases when</font>

867
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:26,740
you talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the policy walks as they</font>

868
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:28,630
call them in Washington the level of

869
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:32,290
education and knowledge understanding

870
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:33,800
remember<font color="#CCCCCC"> turrble in the did the Internet</font>

871
00:39:32,290 --> 00:39:36,290
in Australia

872
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:38,000
the problem is at that level understand

873
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:39,620
is very low I think the solution has to

874
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,300
be education and that feed right the

875
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:42,980
present moment we have no choice<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

876
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:47,360
when you have to come down on the side

877
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:52,240
of a much stronger far more secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> nun</font>
