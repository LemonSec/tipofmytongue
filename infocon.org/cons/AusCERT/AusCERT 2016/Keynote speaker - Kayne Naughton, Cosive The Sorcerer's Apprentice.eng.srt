I'm just about the topic the Sorcerer's

of as our boat factories full of

about it nowadays but the swing rights

also occurred in northern England with

91
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,959
the mechanical threshing machines that

92
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:41,429
were displacing a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people working</font>

themselves um he's also interesting he

100
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,970
would fit in very well in our current

mixed up and mashed up into all sorts of

00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:07,410
musical works I think he's the guy who

104
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:09,208
invented the director's cut like George

107
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,070
times because he didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> like what he'd</font>

done a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> years before it's all</font>

109
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:19,950
very very modern in terms of what AI is

110
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:23,340
when I say I i I'm really talking about

111
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:24,360
machine learning ultimately effectively

112
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,539
all the thinking of<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a neural network</font>

113
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,680
it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> approximately like this I</font>

114
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:30,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">Rackley we call it a neural network</font>

115
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,280
named after the neurons in our brain we

116
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't actually know how those work yet</font>

117
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:37,890
so a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our hubris</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in itself</font>

118
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,200
but the the concept being you know we've

119
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:44,099
got the neurons the sign<font color="#CCCCCC"> apses joining</font>

120
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,870
them all together we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the inputs we</font>

121
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:49,080
have hidden layers which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a bunch</font>

122
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:51,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">of things all interconnected and then</font>

123
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,940
we'll have like a final layer and then

124
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,680
effectively what the output is if you

125
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:57,330
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about artificial</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">intelligence and neural networks that</font>

127

128
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:02,040
all this stuff from first principles

129
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:04,560
with a lot of maths and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really</font>

130
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:06,090
really hard this guy does it a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

131
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,910
easily more practically I could have

132
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:11,310
saved a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of relearning how to do you</font>

133
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:14,430
know dot products of matrices and stuff

134
00:05:11,310 --> 00:05:24,960
had I seen this earlier no mass today by

135
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:27,060
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way so you're welcome I a neuron so</font>

136
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,739
the neurons in this<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh they are that the</font>

137
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">methods differ but effectively it's</font>

138
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:33,870
something that we call a sigmoid

139
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,910
function named after the the signature

140
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:38,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">ball the S shape um I'll do you a favor</font>

141

143
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,990
the colon or thoughts are really bad

144
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:44,850
things happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it not while you're</font>

145
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,180
eating your breakfast<font color="#E5E5E5"> just take my word</font>

146
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:49,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's s-shaped and move on with your life</font>

147
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:52,710
generally<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea is that you'll have</font>

148
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:54,330
like two things in and depending on

149
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,830
either the difference between them the

150
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:58,080
combination of them or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> there'll</font>

151
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:00,000
be a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> Y value typically in a</font>

152
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,370
simplistic case like an O or a one is

153
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">that a true or a false should I play</font>

154
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:07,020
golf today you know if the weather's

155
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,050
this and the rains that then yes it's a

156
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,159
good day for golf otherwise it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

157
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,980
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of algorithms they're</font>

158
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,470
largely chosen at random by people

159
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:18,390
ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> what a machine learning</font>

160
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,010
algorithm<font color="#CCCCCC"> is trying to do is produce a</font>

161
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:23,880
line of best fit you've got one thing

162
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:25,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">like shoe purchases by men or shoe</font>

163
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,780
purchases by women you've got these

164
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:29,760
multiple doc you've got multiple points

165
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,909
in a plane and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to I do a</font>

166
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:35,940
line of best fit between them<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's all</font>

167
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:39,150
effectively machine learning is so the

168
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:40,620
way we hear it it's very complicated is

169
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,299
very convoluted

170
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,560
I'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit more about later</font>

171
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,780
culturally we see it one way

172
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,729
realistically it's about the map bunch

173
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:51,448
of math functions to smush together and

174
00:06:47,729 --> 00:06:54,150
it says like yes or no based on the way

175
00:06:51,449 --> 00:06:57,870
that some very basic functions spat out

176
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:59,520
into each other not that hard the cost

177
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,680
the cost is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting things that</font>

178
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you're doing a neural network it</font>

179
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically jiggles a bunch of weighting</font>

180
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:08,340
factors around until a cost function is

181
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,600
good which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is good if you're doing say</font>

182
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,919
you're doing a pumpkin trebuchet you

183
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,020
want to shoot a pumpkin across the field

184
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:14,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you want to hit a target with it the</font>

185
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,229
cost is how far away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from your target</font>

186
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,400
are you it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy and we're</font>

187
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:19,469
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> any sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you look</font>

188
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,210
leave Eden thing it's fine or lawn bowls

189
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:24,120
for that matter but when you're talking

190
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:26,698
like customer engagement or detecting

191
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,500
cancer or trying to do these really hard

192
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:31,500
things determining a cost function is

193
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:33,000
very difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I think that's going</font>

194
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be the biggest challenge for us going</font>

195
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,680
forward is when we do machine learning

196
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:39,780
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> eventually get to a I like what is</font>

197
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,190
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the goal what is the target how</font>

198
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,960
do we define what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we really want out of</font>

199
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:44,910
things we as humans have a very

200
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,859
intrinsic understanding of the problem

201
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:50,250
we're facing but we generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't</font>

202
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:52,200
explain it very well as a concept of

203
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:55,110
supervisor<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus unsupervised learning</font>

204
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,580
um supervised diz when you have pre

205
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:58,860
classified things and that's a large

206
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:01,650
focus<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my talk today you have to tell</font>

207
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:05,310
the AI you know this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an apple this is</font>

208
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:07,409
an orange and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then it can learn how to</font>

209
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,729
differentiate between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> two there's an</font>

210
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:11,960
unsupervised learning where it's just

211
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:15,900
like what stands out what's different

212
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:19,530
I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about why that's a problem so</font>

213
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:21,388
when we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

214
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:23,638
like this this is like a graph of what

215
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:24,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost may look like you don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

216
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">the graph looks like you're just trying</font>

217
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:29,340
various things and say guys this better

218
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,888
or worse than<font color="#CCCCCC"> last time but you may find</font>

219
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:35,338
yourself like it's like all if I'm over

220
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:36,779
there around 24 if I go like 24.2 that's

221
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:38,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">way</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> better but you don't realize you</font>

222
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:40,260
what's called a local minima so

223
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,940
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on how you set things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up you</font>

224
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,218
can get what's the right answer but it's

225
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually a wrong answer it's all about</font>

226
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:50,970
what we call exploration<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus</font>

227
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:52,950
exploitation now we as a society

228
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,990
particularly at our mass media have a

229
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:58,120
fantastic

230
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:58,120
skillet lying to ourselves through math

artificial<font color="#CCCCCC"> intelligence gives us a far</font>

232
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:05,270
greater opportunity to do this I've

233
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:07,279
definitely proven to myself you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

234
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:09,020
one of a stupid<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea you've got if you</font>

235
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> enough stupid data for it you can</font>

236
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,740
find a neural networking model that will

237
00:09:11,029 --> 00:09:14,270
tell you you're correct it does not

238
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,220
represent the real world<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever you</font>

239
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:19,370
feed it it'll make something that works

240
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:21,770
and it's as much like this here from

241
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:23,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">this Perez spurious correlation website</font>

a fishing boat correlates very closely

244
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:30,770
to the marriage rate in Kentucky there's

245
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:33,800
a ninety-five percent correlation right

246
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:36,439
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is far better than every academic</font>

247

248
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,339
its rate of correlation you should

249
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:42,080
always bear that in mind when you read

250
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:44,450
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> papers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are the most amazing guy</font>

251
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,709
I've seen the man I've seen somewhere

252
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,360
they'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> bragged that they managed to get</font>

253
00:09:45,709 --> 00:09:48,979
from like seventy percent accurate us at

254
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:52,190
seventy percent to seventy-five percent

255
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:53,779
accuracy if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I flip a coin I've got fifty</font>

256
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:57,230
percent accuracy so they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing better</font>

257
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:58,790
than a coin but yeah we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

258
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:01,390
be careful when we measure this hot

because it's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will</font>

00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:06,800
definitely impact our society is

00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:08,510
impacting our society right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now there's</font>

262
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,040
also what's really cool recurrent neural

263
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:11,569
networks where you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even have to</font>

264
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,750
really structure your data you just go

265
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:18,020
here's a fire hose of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> and like a</font>

268
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:24,079
just he's a bunch of you know lines with

269
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,490
numbers on them in it wrote songs the

270
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,099
songs weren't very good what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

271
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:31,100
expect but you can use a neural network

272
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:33,050
to understand almost anything in a

273
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,610
convincing manner to a human league oh I

274
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:38,089
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite get the result but it seems</font>

275
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:39,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know what it's talking about one of</font>

handwritten digits and we teach

279
00:10:45,170 --> 00:10:49,849
computers how to identify what they are

280

eight points the computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't see</font>

sees a bunch of

288
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:13,099
points that are effectively a 768

289
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:15,590
dimensional object like you don't know

290
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:17,810
we have a real tendency to

291
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:19,730
anthropomorphize things we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

292
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:21,469
things are thinking like we do we think

293
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,790
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know a dog is happy because of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the weight greets us when it comes home</font>

295
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:26,750
and uh you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know a lot of people have a</font>

296
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,430
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this with like Apes and</font>

them and they go in for a hug<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then</font>

299

they tear their face off<font color="#E5E5E5"> um you know we</font>

300
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:37,069
see things in nature and we identify the

301
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:41,510
characteristics of humans as part of

302
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:43,520
that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a safe way of thinking</font>

303
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:47,420
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> AI in my view if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you think about</font>

304
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:49,100
it like an interdimensional an enemy

305
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:50,810
there's wiggling its tendrils and a

306
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,640
bunch of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> planes to try and</font>

307
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:54,560
find something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that feels right that is</font>

308
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,850
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I is doing it's not like a person</font>

309
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:58,939
sitting there scratching its head

310
00:11:55,850 --> 00:12:00,440
puzzling it out I honestly don't know

311
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:04,460
whether a like blade runner style

312
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,870
replicant or a interdimensional<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font>

313
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:09,440
know i put this word in here<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can't say</font>

00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:12,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and then knee is well scary and then</font>

315
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">mini I got it now who but yeah we really</font>

316
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:15,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't understand the problems we're</font>

317
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:17,410
solving when we give it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to AI so how do</font>

318
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:19,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">we assess whether it's doing a good job</font>

319
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:22,520
anyway we're getting towards the end of

320
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:25,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what I is when we have a lot of</font>

321
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:27,470
dimensions like a lot of dimensions we

322
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:29,480
end up projecting them onto a flatter

323
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,220
plane it's much like if you take a 3-d

324
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,390
drawing and you show it in two days

325
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,740
you've got the ways of drawing the line

326
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:35,420
so everyone sort of can picture in there

327
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:37,730
but it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like but when you're</font>

328
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:39,890
talking you know above 17 dimensions

329
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:41,810
things get a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> weed and fuzzy even for</font>

330
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:44,540
the AI this is a really interesting

00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:47,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">artwork called self-imposed misery where</font>

332
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:50,209
it's a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of garbage in a line and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">when the light is shone from the right</font>

334
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:54,200
direction looks like a silhouette of a

335
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:56,570
person that's effectively what we're

336
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,130
doing when we do most a I models if you

337
00:12:56,570 --> 00:13:00,380
put way too much data and it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives</font>

338
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:01,910
you even more junk but so people are

00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,590
holding up a piece of<font color="#E5E5E5"> cardboard the</font>

340
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,329
problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can like flex that</font>

341
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:07,790
cardboard to get a bit more shadow of

342
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:10,490
certain parts or others<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we also have</font>

343
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:12,079
a way of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> own biases can be</font>

projecting into the way that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IAI</font>

and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a neural network which you</font>

it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good at world one level one</font>

361
00:13:50,779 --> 00:13:55,430
as you'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a moment it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

363
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:59,089
see you can see the buttons that's

00:13:56,930 --> 00:14:01,310
pressing it just<font color="#CCCCCC"> mashes down like a mad</font>

365
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:03,980
bastard the hoping at some point that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

will do<font color="#E5E5E5"> something useful at note you'll</font>

367
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,430
notice that no time in the video did it

368
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:09,229
actually go down<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pipe look there he</font>

369
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:11,660
goes he crashed at no time did he go

370
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:13,639
down a pipe just one of the good events

371
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:15,500
that he saw involved him hitting the

372
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:16,910
down button so he's like down buttons

373
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:19,160
good i<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with down button</font>

374
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:21,589
you also knows he never uses like the

375
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,699
hold-down be to run fast just<font color="#CCCCCC"> because he</font>

376
00:14:21,589 --> 00:14:24,680
never held down things in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

377
00:14:22,699 --> 00:14:26,149
combination will understand it um you

378
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,560
also get going at a he like it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

379
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:29,750
he it's a computer<font color="#E5E5E5"> but we have a</font>

382
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,880
things this one's interesting because it

383
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,029
basically structures in your all<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network</font>

384

randomly to work<font color="#CCCCCC"> out what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> comes our best</font>

385
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:43,100
now and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is very relevant Adam</font>

386
00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:46,670
mentioned the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alpha go that's based on</font>

393
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:03,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">like a few blocks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and fed it to a back</font>

00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:25,008
then chase the ghosts that just never

happened and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's set up so it looks</font>

like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a really really good player but it</font>

00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:31,279
never<font color="#CCCCCC"> really got that understanding but</font>

406
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:34,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is what they use to show people is</font>

407
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,329
like it's basically putting down a baby

408
00:15:34,069 --> 00:15:36,949
in front of something

409
00:15:35,329 --> 00:15:39,618
and it works at how to use it except<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

410
00:15:36,949 --> 00:15:43,939
its not a baby it's an anemone there's

411
00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:45,499
no human thought process going on um so

412
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:48,170
in terms of what this might look like in

413
00:15:45,499 --> 00:15:50,959
<font color="#CCCCCC">the real world okay so say you know</font>

414
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:52,519
we've cashed up next year we got a lot

415
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,809
we want to give away<font color="#E5E5E5"> a car at our booth</font>

416
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:56,149
because you know that'll be fantastic

417
00:15:53,809 --> 00:15:57,618
idea but we don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to waste that car</font>

418
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:59,920
on you peasants we only want high

419
00:15:57,619 --> 00:16:02,239
rollers we're going to buy our stuff so

420
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,009
so what we could do is we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got the</font>

421
00:16:02,239 --> 00:16:05,449
badge scanner so we get the titles<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

422
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:07,910
training<font color="#CCCCCC"> data</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for people we're going to</font>

423
00:16:05,449 --> 00:16:10,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">run a raffle some people we know who</font>

424
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:12,170
they are so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get some cameras we</font>

425
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:14,360

00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:43,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">sets of data that for people who had not</font>

00:25:41,529 --> 00:25:46,870
left Afghanistan and Pakistan during a

670
00:25:43,539 --> 00:25:49,629
time period they took<font color="#CCCCCC"> 80 features so 80</font>

671
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:52,168
different data sets but seven people

672

they had identified<font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> terrorist careers</font>

673
00:25:52,169 --> 00:25:58,690
so 55 million phones seven phones

674
00:25:56,230 --> 00:26:00,399
belonging two bad dudes and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided</font>

675
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:02,500
that they wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do effectively a</font>

they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> find the terrorists they</font>

00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">ended up they took a hundred thousand</font>

679
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:11,380
just random people from Pakistan and

680
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:13,719
Afghanistan to mix in the list so

681
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:15,490
chances are if you never left Karachi

682
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,110
you're probably pretty cool when you're

683
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:18,700
in that data set anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> who travels</font>

00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:22,209
vaguely between regions<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've probably</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty much stuffed they had the they</font>

686
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:25,480
thought they could get as low as a point

687
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:28,090
one eight percent error rate which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

688
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:30,399
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good but it involves missing</font>

689
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:34,269
fifty percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the terrorists and you</font>

690
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:36,489
end up with somewhere around 15,000

691
00:26:34,269 --> 00:26:38,260
falsely identified people so for fifty

692
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:40,980
percent hit rate you get 15,000 people

693
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:43,860
you're willing to you know bomb from

694
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:46,070
yeah including in their slides it will

695
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:49,799

technology and concepts into a war zone

potentially anyway this is what people

fun at the same time that computers are

started driving real trucks<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a lot</font>

like you know watching<font color="#CCCCCC"> my kitchen rules</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">2,000 km</font>

750
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:59,620
is across for borders in Europe and they

751
00:28:56,950 --> 00:29:01,390
drive like a like the peloton in the

752
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:02,889

753
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:04,840
behind each other so they save a lot of

754
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:06,940
fuel it's pretty cool humans can't

755
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:09,550
really do it um in theory it's safer but

756
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:11,590
the problem is we have 275,000 truck

757
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:12,879
drivers in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Australia</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's just the</font>

towns<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the cafes and petrol stations</font>

760
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,990
that everything that supports them so

761
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,670
that's like probably a four percent of

762
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:23,560
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Australian population is involved in</font>

people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to be displaced by</font>

automated trucks in all likelihood you

766
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:31,689
know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could say that they legislate</font>

767
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:35,470
against it but we legislate against uber

768
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:37,150
and how well is that working<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font>

769
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:41,230
understanding language is a really

770
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:43,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting one this is those</font>

775
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:55,990
it's a jump in accuracy in terms of

776
00:29:52,960 --> 00:30:00,550
breaking down language but in terms<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

777
00:29:55,990 --> 00:30:04,480
the two examples there the one<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

778
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:07,450

one<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the right which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the way</font>

781

another model did it was Ellis drove

down the road in<font color="#CCCCCC"> her car why she has a</font>

784
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:20,950
is really hard other languages may be a

785
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:22,659
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier but not by much so the</font>

786
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:24,760
ability to break down language is really

787
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:31,030
important but a lot of the stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:32,890
see isn't great exhibit a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tay microsoft</font>

789
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:35,560
did a lot of favors in terms of being

scared<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i hear they hyped it real</font>

793
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:45,040
out this it's awesome and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then yes you</font>

794
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:46,540
know people getting it to say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,710
repeated and back and learn from them

<font color="#E5E5E5">what's worse to use some of these parts</font>

they were doing at the time that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

tweeting this stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know they</font>

00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,390

words mean it sort of breaks them down

812
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:23,260
like a grade 6 English assignment has

813
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:25,600
seen previously you know who's now do

814
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:27,280
you want a verb and then it goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

sort of funds related terms and parrots

it back it doesn't understand anything

817
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:35,470
yeah a lot of basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> these some of</font>

818
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:38,320
the least offensive things that people

819
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:39,610
got it to say this one was interesting

820
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,040
this wasn't actually someone saying

821
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:43,270
repeat after me it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> like I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> learned</font>

00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,889
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best you know if you don't let</font>

824
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:49,240
your dumb to like that could have been

825
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">the improv team that they got doing some</font>

826
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:55,210
writing for it but I'm pretty sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

827
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:57,130
wasn't yeah I also tried like the

00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:59,230
summarized tool on skype when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> beams</font>

829
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:00,640
other things<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just basically gave me</font>

830
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:03,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">some dot points about paragraphs that</font>

831
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:06,790
was no good something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they said</font>

832
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:08,410
regarding tahiz we were probably over

833
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:10,149
focused on thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about some of the</font>

834
00:32:08,410 --> 00:32:12,610
technical challenges and a lot of this

835
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:15,550
as a social challenge we feel terrible

836
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:17,409
so many people were offended you know it

837
00:32:15,550 --> 00:32:21,010
is as long as they learn that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

838
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:24,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">right this is a small test audit of the</font>

842
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:33,130
which is a bit of a shame oh and just

843
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:36,430
for the for the general people in

844
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:37,390
security here don't put your demos out

845
00:32:36,430 --> 00:32:39,970
with cross-site scripting

846
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:41,830
vulnerabilities in them please like I

847
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:42,970
really should report this to IBM but

848
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:45,699
they should have really figured<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out</font>

849
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:47,200

yeah cross-site scripting die exploits

00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:16,400
have a natural hubris or out technology

999
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,860
we invented this technology we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1000
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:20,690
anything but um you know when we look at

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list you know look at Fast and the</font>

technology in some ways conversely we

1006
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:33,440
could be looking at a far better future

1007

like<font color="#CCCCCC"> AI can guide crop planting and</font>

things like that it's it allows you to

00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:40,580
do independent validating of votes to

1010
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,750
try and stop dirty elections because you

1011
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:43,790
can sort of model what things look like

1012
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:46,310
and fix it it's all sorts of amazing

1013

the moment you know if you can't really

absorb information from a blackboard at

1018

<font color="#CCCCCC">the ability to use this technology you</font>

tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think in an anthropomorphic</font>

that's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sort of situation</font>

we're going to be looking at a is not

1038
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:39,230
going to be like people we don't even

understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> how people work my</font>

1040
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:43,490
expectation is that once we invent a

1041
00:39:40,970 --> 00:39:44,899
computer super intelligence it will be

1042
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:46,660
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out the human brain it's</font>

1043
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:49,850
not going to happen the other way<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

1044
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:51,799
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> no my best hope is that I have a</font>

1045
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:54,799
skill that the super intelligence finds

1046
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:58,859
entertaining it'll keep me as a pet

1047
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,510
best option probably in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what's</font>

1048
00:39:58,859 --> 00:40:02,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to get us there open source open</font>

don't have to understand all of the

answer out for better<font color="#E5E5E5"> or worse this</font>

consensus stuff is really interesting

00:40:33,089 --> 00:40:37,410
you knew I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> you say they they get a</font>

1065
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:40,348
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and they use artificial</font>

1066
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:41,700
intelligence to basically take all of

1067

the different answers and learn from<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1072
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:59,010
could be smoking mirrors like I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1075
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:04,890
on it that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been a good story</font>

1076
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:06,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">too so yeah it's the ability</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font>

1077
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:10,080
humans and computers together much like

1078
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:12,299
a couple of grand masters and Fritz

1079
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:14,009
chess is far better than any AI when it

1080
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:15,630
comes to playing chess the cooperation

1081
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:17,880
works much better the things we're good

1082
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:20,400
at the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're good at um</font>

1083
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:23,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook is making an AI there's really</font>

1084
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:24,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">good at optimizing assessing a eyes and</font>

1085
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:27,660
they've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a harness</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font>

1086
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:29,670
they're also using their ai ai to train

1087
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:31,200
their a I oh I oh I so you know it's

1088
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:35,099
like exhibit they put an AI in your eye

1089
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:37,290
so yeah it's pretty cool stuff we won't

1090
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:38,430
get super intelligence from it but it's

1091
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:40,650
definitely going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a piece of the</font>

1092
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:43,589
puzzle like it making an AI that's

1093
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:45,270
really good at producing a I will get us

1094
00:41:43,589 --> 00:41:47,190
there rather than humans iterating over

1095
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:48,900
it then they tune the hell out of it

1096
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:50,880
which is great<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> running out of time</font>

1097
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,619
so I'll go real quick how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fight</font>

1098
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,790
machine learning surveillance if you are

1099
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:58,020
concerned about after seeing stuff today

1100
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:59,880
use travel cards and things like that

1101
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:02,460
stochastically at random so your

1102
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:04,440
patterns are harder to pick up don't use

1103
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:06,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">your loyalty cards from stores if you're</font>

00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,100
buying chocolates and cigarettes they

1105
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,779
still email me about one

1107
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:14,070
careful what i buy on it what I don't

1108

see your<font color="#E5E5E5"> mama mileage may vary you know</font>

cycle your mac address turn off your

Bluetooth IDs<font color="#CCCCCC"> and devices</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that go need</font>

them so they know how long<font color="#E5E5E5"> you stop and</font>

1114
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:27,900
look industry codes appease the

1115
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:29,189
government but there's no real

1116

regulation about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff that's</font>

1121
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,759
interesting haircuts and face paint

little avoid stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> here some people had</font>

1123
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:49,350
their own crack at it I don't know how

1124
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:51,090
successful they were problem being that

1125

you know unless is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bowie retrospective</font>

stick out doesn't matter if I can't

there's Russian find face stuff that's

seventy percent accurate that's pretty

1141
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:25,230
damn cool but yeah you're much better to

totally useless because you built an AI

00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:00,540
that can predict an II's output that is

1159

at the around the turn of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> century</font>

moving back into America and Australia

1193

because you can build an automated plant

and have your engineers they're taking

1195

you know takes two guys to look after a

1196

holistically what changes your company

00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:37,060
think about what you're doing think

my loyalty to you upon your ascension

1212
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:58,230
I'm one quick question the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google I I</font>

1213
00:45:54,290 --> 00:46:01,200
thing there was that that move in Game

1214
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:03,810
three<font color="#CCCCCC"> move 37 where the machine</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> makes</font>

1215
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,790
this move and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the guys watching go it's</font>

1216
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:07,110
stuffed up there that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> must be a</font>

1217
00:46:05,790 --> 00:46:09,779
mistake they surely<font color="#E5E5E5"> should have gone</font>

1218
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:13,140
down there and an hour later they

1219
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:15,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">realize wow that was a move in this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> game</font>

1220
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:17,279
that wasn't just a great example of what

1221
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:19,500
humans know from what I understand it's

1222
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:22,200
been in there claiming just on a

1223
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:25,050
tactical level that humans have never

1224
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:27,390
reached right are they gilding the lily

1225
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:28,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">a little bit there and even is it just a</font>

1226
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:31,129
one-off thing that doesn't represent

1227
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:33,690
that much or is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a you know a</font>

1228
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:35,160
breakthrough in a way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about</font>

00:46:33,690 --> 00:46:38,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">a game that humans have been played for</font>

1230
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:41,490
thousands of years it's I believe it's

1231
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:42,720
an error that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it made and it was</font>

1232
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:44,399
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> because after seeing what</font>

1233
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,549
got really flustered the opponent you

1234
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:51,570
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> ink game for he did something weird</font>

00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:53,670
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> alphago will drop its bundle</font>

1236
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:54,780
like when he stopped playing like a

00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:57,300
professional the same way they play

1238
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:59,070
against chess computers if you do

1239

something<font color="#E5E5E5"> abnormal that's outside</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1240
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:02,910
it's sort of pre-calculated trees it

1241
00:47:01,050 --> 00:47:04,380
freaks out too so you know humans

1242
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:07,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">complained that game and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making a weed</font>

1243
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:09,420
choice give him a round of applause that

1244
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:12,770
was just wonderful they're gonna take

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your kind exactly just right</font>
