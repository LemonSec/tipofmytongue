Queensland I'll be chairing this session

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,179
we're not going to have the interactive

6
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:13,650
questions so if time permits we'll just

7
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:17,520
throw questions to the floor this

thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody look I'm an identity</font>

guy and I exercise multiple identities

that case a lockstep technologies I'm

21
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,660
here as constellation constellation is a

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,500
research firm that sponsored the

23
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:05,280
research that I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to present today</font>

24
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:07,950
in our 2008 this obscure paper was

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,710
self-published by a personal person so

26
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:14,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">we still don't know who Satoshi Nakamoto</font>

27
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:16,710
is of course the rumor emerged in some

28
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,000
months ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was an Aussie and I</font>

29
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,850
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stack soon afterwards and</font>

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,650
some she said to me is it you Steve and

31
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,809
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the second most flattering thing</font>

32
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:25,770
that's ever been said to me the most

33
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:28,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">flattering thing was that my</font>

34
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,908
eight-year-old son developed this thesis

35
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,939
that I had built the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sydney Harbour</font>

36
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,500
Bridge and you know I dined out on that

37
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,729
for a long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> so sadly I didn't do</font>

38
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,630
that I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> Paul Hogan on I'm</font>

39
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:42,840
definitely not Nakamoto I say it's an

40
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,860
obscure paper because it's on everybody

41
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,590
should read it<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the way it's eight</font>

42
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:49,409
pages a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people who haven't read</font>

43
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,390
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and should have read it um I say it's</font>

44
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,280
obscure because it focuses on two things

45
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:55,890
one of them is cryptography one of them

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,649
is politics and<font color="#E5E5E5"> those are topics that</font>

47
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,689
people don't think deeply about often

48
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:04,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">let alone at the same time in the same</font>

00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:07,408
paper the paper does one thing or it

specifies<font color="#CCCCCC"> blockchain and block Shane</font>

54
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:16,290
focus today and what block train<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

55
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,700
does what it doesn't do and try and

56
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">challenge people to be a bit more</font>

57
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,799

58
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:25,829
dealing with I think it does and it's in

59
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,599
the paper it solves the problem known as

60
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:29,849
double spending with a particular

61
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,000
algorithm that's incredibly extravagant

62
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:34,018
and incredibly impractical and it's

63
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably going to die under its own</font>

64
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:39,750
weight in the next few years but it does

65
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,920
one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it does something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:50,010
incredibly important but going from that

69
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:52,080
really dry paper blockchain is many

70
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,429
things I've said it solves one problem

71
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,170
but nevertheless it's many things

72
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,500
including a publication phenomenon

73
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:59,849
there's a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people here on the</font>

themselves they've reinvented themselves

76
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:09,030
on the back of blockchain nothing's

77
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:10,410
captivated the imagination like

they say some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them aren't on the</font>

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,090
that block chain is done in effect

91
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:56,130
crowdsources regulation of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> money</font>

Africa stamp out corruption in Africa

95
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:06,810
the headline says it all in this case

it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do something about child</font>

100
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:17,910
but it's nuanced and they have some

101
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:19,680
trepidations but they say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this is</font>

103

mission to stamp out try poverty I find

104
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,370
that abhorrent

105
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:31,919
so I'm from the sublime to the

106
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:33,480
ridiculous firefighters are told that

107
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,850
block change is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide them</font>

108
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,200
unlimited communication channels once

109
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,480
they use bluetooth to hook their

110
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,560
internet of things onto the block chain

111
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:43,380
because everything needs to be on the

112
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,590
block chain the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin transactions are</font>

113
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:47,760
capped out at about seven per second

114
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:49,440
it's a limitation the algorithm but

115
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:54,630
people still say that everything on the

116
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,010
IOT has to be on the blockchain so

117
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:57,990
there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Chinese whispers going</font>

118
00:04:56,010 --> 00:05:00,750
on and some terms like wealth indicate

119
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:02,460
and verify these terms appear and when

120
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,920
they're read by non-specialists they

121
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,210
have forgiven to take verify or

122
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,370
authenticate to<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean something that's</font>

123
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:12,500
not in the blockchain paper so this

124
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:17,000
Chinese whispers happens and at scale

125
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:19,500
there's a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of delusion going on</font>

126
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">well-meaning project</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> call ID 2020</font>

moment are not online and the

136
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,810
a well-meaning project but it turned

137
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,550
into a blockchain conference these are

138
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,750
the sponsors that<font color="#CCCCCC"> line up at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the United</font>

blockchain you're courting disaster

because of key management so I promise

00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:08,040
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get into some crypto</font>

151
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:14,480
in them and some technical material for

152
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:17,160
the for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sake of this audience so</font>

153
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:18,600
what problem are we trying to solve with

154
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,450
digital currency the double spend

155
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,760
problem has been with us<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a 30 years</font>

156
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:25,979
a guy called David Tron actually did a

157
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:29,010
good job of solving double spend a long

158
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:30,870
time ago but mathematicians agree that

159
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:32,820
um what you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is to watch the</font>

160
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:34,720
transactions so you've got Alice and Bob

161
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:37,210
have got digital currency

162
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:41,200
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to try and move some</font>

163
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:42,400
digital clams from Alice and Bob 10 is

164
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,140
how do till the originals where you

165
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,270
digitally sign them right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> digital</font>

166
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:48,340
signatures of long been core to this so

167
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:51,010
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can tell original data from</font>

168
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,450
copy data but even so nothing stop you

169
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,280
replaying digital signatures unless

170
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:56,200
you're really careful it's been accepted

171
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,609
for a long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the solution of</font>

172
00:06:56,200 --> 00:07:01,210
this is to in fact watch every

173
00:06:57,610 --> 00:07:03,280
transaction in order to solve the double

174
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:05,500
spin so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alice tries to move the same</font>

175
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:07,570
claims to same two different people very

176
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,990
quickly than how do you resolve the race

177
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:13,650
a conventional approach is it use a

178
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,670
digital<font color="#CCCCCC"> Reserve Bank and you have God</font>

179
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,200
sitting there watching every single

180
00:07:15,670 --> 00:07:18,670
transaction<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm popping them into a</font>

181
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,289
ledger and counting them and making sure

182
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:22,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">that this is the first one this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

183
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:24,640
second one are not too sure which one is

184
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:28,539
103 so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I make some sort of godlike</font>

185
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:29,680
policy decision and reject the copy so

186
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:32,200
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the state-of-the-art until</font>

187
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nakamoto came along Nakamoto wanted to</font>

188
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,430
solve the double spin problem but he she

189
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,440
wanted to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in a particular way and</font>

190
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:42,090
that's where the politics comes in

191
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:45,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nakamoto found the Reserve Bank to be</font>

192
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:47,950
distasteful evil or that guy was an

193

anarchist he wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get away from</font>

196
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,430
most smartest framing of this

197
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:59,290
cryptocurrency problem that I've come

198
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:00,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">across recently came from a new your</font>

banker who said you know what they were

200
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,750
really trying to do is they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font>

201
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:06,789
get any barriers out of the way of money

202
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,650
movement at the moment when you think

203
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:11,850
about it something stops something gets

204
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:15,640
in the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Alice</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and Bob moving money</font>

205
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:16,570
and the framing of the problem is why

206
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:19,270
don't you get rid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of those</font>

207
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:22,419
barriers and hence the<font color="#E5E5E5"> word frictionless</font>

208
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:26,080
is used all sorts of metaphors are used

209
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:27,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">I challenge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you to find a description of</font>

210
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,620
blockchain that doesn't use a metaphor

00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:31,299
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of my goal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> states</font>

00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,740
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to write a paragraph that</font>

has no metaphors<font color="#E5E5E5"> to explain what this</font>

00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:38,320
thing does I haven't haven't succeeded

00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:40,390
at that yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nakamoto is I'm genius and</font>

216
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,770
you know people<font color="#E5E5E5"> will argue that the</font>

217
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:44,110
bones of<font color="#CCCCCC"> block train were put in place</font>

218
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:47,310
earlier<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to accept the</font>

219
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:50,260
premise that Nakamoto invented this

220
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:52,000
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> genius was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to crowdsource the</font>

221
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,880
observation or the monitoring<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all of</font>

222
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,620
those transactions and to do so with

223
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,210
what is generically called a consensus

224
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,270
algorithm and in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case of blockchain</font>

225
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:04,690
it's called proof of work the idea is

226
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:06,460
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> to crowdsource that oversight</font>

227
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,800
so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no single</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> point of failure</font>

228
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:11,230
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's no single Authority getting</font>

229
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,790
in the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> making policy decisions I'm</font>

230
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,770
you share the work in the case of

231
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:18,150
consensus by proof of work you share the

232
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:21,490
work across a vast array of nodes and

233
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:23,439
hence if you know anything about Bitcoin

234
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:25,420
you'll know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the computer network</font>

235
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,640
that holds it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up is currently consuming</font>

236
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:30,339
the electricity it's about equivalent to

237
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:31,689
the entire country<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Denmark and so the</font>

238
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:33,880
economics of this thing becomes a bit

239
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:34,870
strange but there's all sorts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

240
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,020
that we could talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about blockchain</font>

241
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:39,490
being just being strange so we've got

242
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,079
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these networks and what they're</font>

243
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,630
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they are observing every</font>

244
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,950
single transaction and periodically

245
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:48,040
sharing their sense of which

246
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:50,440
transactions came in what order and then

247
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:52,569
across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the network voting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and freezing</font>

248
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,540
the sake of the ledger at a particular

249
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:56,470
point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time and publishing that</font>

250
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,120
cryptographically what it is is that

251
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's a hash of the previous period of</font>

252
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,260
transactions hashed with every other

253
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:04,300
transaction in history so the entire

254
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:08,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">history of the network is represented</font>

255
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:09,880
and is inviolable it can't be tampered

256
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:11,319
with not only is it digitally signed on

257
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:13,630
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> inputs but the entire thing is then</font>

258
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,040
distributed across all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the nodes so</font>

259
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:17,500
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the properties</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that block train</font>

00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:23,740

261
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:25,210
massively redundant nakamoto did several

262
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:28,420
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> clever things in the paper but</font>

263
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:29,860
the incentive was particularly clever so

264
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,810
how do you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of these computers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

265
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,100
to do the work what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

266
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:35,979
want set them<font color="#E5E5E5"> all up with their own</font>

267
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:39,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">Bitcoin wallets and then randomly you</font>

268
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,510
pay them for their<font color="#E5E5E5"> effort now the fine</font>

269
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,640
print is that's got to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> with hashing</font>

270
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:44,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it's got to do with reverse</font>

271
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,390
engineering and guessing a hash and

272
00:10:44,230 --> 00:10:49,390
doing a brute force<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack so for the</font>

273
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:51,100
purposes of today it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually and when</font>

274
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:53,230
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about it it's quite it's quite</font>

275
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:56,260
funny that these people are just being

276
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:58,420
paid randomly they improve<font color="#CCCCCC"> their odds</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

277
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,920
being paid by doing more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the work and</font>

278
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,139
setting<font color="#E5E5E5"> up supercomputers in their own</font>

279
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,660
backyards and some of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin</font>

280
00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:05,980
mining rigs it's called really quite

281
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:08,050
astonishing their pictures all over the

282
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,480
Internet at people with metal frame

283
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:12,279
sheds in the in the back of a paddock

284
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,839
somewhere very secret because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font>

285
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:16,089
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> your your enemies to come and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find</font>

286
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,560
you Bitcoin mining rig but an

287
00:11:16,089 --> 00:11:20,800
astonishing investment that people are

288
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:24,310
putting in that's where we're at that's

289
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,689
the bare bones of it and as I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

290
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:27,849
was an<font color="#CCCCCC"> impossible problem the idea that</font>

291
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:31,570
you could crowd source or get away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

impossible and every<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and again</font>

294
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:38,230
somebody solves an impossible problem

295
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,670
and it can create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole new branch of</font>

maths or it can create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a whole new</font>

form of geometry can also affect a prime

numbers or um or elliptic curves right

303
00:11:55,230 --> 00:12:00,940
it's a very specific solution to a very

304
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:02,739
specific problem I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there will</font>

the blockchain so how<font color="#CCCCCC"> come we're so</font>

308
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,570
excited<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this I've written a long</font>

309
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,459
paper about this and I've got four or

310
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,420
five theories about why the excitement

311
00:12:12,459 --> 00:12:15,880
has come up i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's an interesting</font>

312
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:19,240
question but i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is as simple as</font>

313
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:20,820
this it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> like magic and the people</font>

314
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:24,579
who haven't really thought it through

315
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:26,230
literally as arthur c clarke said they

316
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:30,699
can't a memorized by it and they're

317
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:32,050
overreaching now the reason why they're

318
00:12:30,699 --> 00:12:34,060
overreaching is the candidate do

319
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,620
multiple things with with blockchain<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

320
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:38,560
standing<font color="#CCCCCC"> here saying it only solves one</font>

321
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:40,750
problem but it's a software platform the

322
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">open-source Bitcoin wallets and the</font>

open-source<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin mining software on</font>

324
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:49,420
the nodes is available and the wallets

in particular of got<font color="#E5E5E5"> AP is so that while</font>

you're moving your<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin around you</font>

327
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:53,949

alice is moving some Bitcoin Bob and

330
00:12:56,019 --> 00:13:00,190
while she's doing that she can also put

331
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:02,739
something into the API and so this

332
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:05,440
allows these records in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ledger to</font>

333
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:07,569
carry other data and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> lickety-split</font>

334
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,110
people started saying if we've got an

335
00:13:07,569 --> 00:13:13,740
inviolable register what other things do

336
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:16,870
we like to put on inviolable registers

337
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:18,400
so their businesses emerging and there's

338
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:19,870
announcements made that the government

339
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:22,000
of Honduras is going to put their land

00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:32,829
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Honduras project is even quoted by</font>

343
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:35,860
the UK chief scientist and it's quoted

344
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:37,930
hundreds of times as a case study it's a

<font color="#CCCCCC">use case land titles on the block train</font>

is a use case what's not it's a press

353

 hit the fan with the government

354
00:13:53,710 --> 00:13:57,940
backing away and denying it and it's

355
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:59,020
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> murky and there's been a blog from</font>

fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm at the beginning of this year</font>

hasn't happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> yet diamonds are</font>

360
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:13,180
happening it's a healthier project of

361
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:16,000
startup company in London<font color="#E5E5E5"> called ever</font>

362

ledger so their proposition is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

363
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,010
diamonds are now<font color="#CCCCCC"> bar-coded at the mines</font>

364
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:22,750
or at the deal is pretty close<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

365
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:25,270
mines before the<font color="#CCCCCC"> diamonds get to London</font>

366
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:28,300
and Tel Aviv in New York so diamonds are

367
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:29,800
uniquely stamp their barcode it now in

368
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:33,160
order to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and get around blood</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">diamonds and ever ledger and proposes</font>

370
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,920
that doing a better job of actually

371
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,510
tracking the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Diamonds once they're</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">bar-coded</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will solve the Blood Diamond</font>

373
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:42,040
problem as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well forgetting that an</font>

00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:45,010
actual<font color="#E5E5E5"> human being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with a laser has to</font>

375
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:47,620
stand between the mine and the Bitcoin

376
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:49,780
wallet so there's a there's an edge

377
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,130
problem it's the first mile problem how

378
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,839
do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> how do you ensure the integrity</font>

379
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:54,340
of the data before it gets on the on the

380
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:56,290
blockchain once it's on the blockchain

381
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:59,830
it's there forever so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

382
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:02,349
 forever on the blockchain an

383
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:04,720
identity there's just dozens of

384
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,610
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up doing</font>

385
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,500
identity on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blockchain the really</font>

386
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:10,600
notable thing about that ecosystem is

387
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,250
that until recently none of those

388
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies have been identity companies</font>

389
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:19,480
they have all been entrepreneurs now I'm

390
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:21,370
an entrepreneur myself but I think it's

391
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,600
a bit weird<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it was only 12 months</font>

392
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:24,010
ago<font color="#CCCCCC"> to my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> knowledge I go to a lot of</font>

393
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,529
identity conferences it was 12<font color="#E5E5E5"> months</font>

394
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">ago</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the CTO of them</font>

395
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:29,769
or ping identity I've blogged about this

396
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:31,269
but ping is one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies the CTO</font>

397
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:33,220
12 months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago hadn't actually heard of</font>

398
00:15:31,269 --> 00:15:36,129
blockchain and he made a keynote speech

399
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:37,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">at a conference of identity people</font>

400
00:15:36,129 --> 00:15:39,069
saying I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this might be important</font>

401
00:15:37,629 --> 00:15:40,660
meanwhile he's coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the back of</font>

402
00:15:39,069 --> 00:15:42,610
dozens of these startup companies that

403
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:44,499
are not identity professional saying we

404
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:45,999
can solve the identity problem and

405
00:15:44,499 --> 00:15:48,550
they're not framing what the identity

406
00:15:45,999 --> 00:15:50,920
problem is so my<font color="#CCCCCC"> suspicions about this</font>

407
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:52,120
ecosystem of identity entrepreneurs is

408
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,170
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's a bit weird that there</font>

409
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,509
aren't people with 20 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

410
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:56,498
experience<font color="#CCCCCC"> in digital identity forming</font>

411
00:15:55,509 --> 00:15:59,050
these companies there are people that

412
00:15:56,499 --> 00:16:00,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">have got 20 months of experience in a</font>

413
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:03,699
technology that frankly they don't

414
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:05,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">really understand now that's about to</font>

415
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:06,099
change I think watch this space in a

416
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:07,149
couple of weeks time there will be an

417
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:09,339
interesting announcement from an

418
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:11,620
identity company who to my knowledge is

419
00:16:09,339 --> 00:16:13,899
the first deep specialist<font color="#E5E5E5"> in identity</font>

420
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:14,920
with dozens of identity people that are

421
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:17,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to announce something really quite</font>

422
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:19,240
interesting now there's a ton of this

423
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:22,230
right so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are flimsier but</font>

424
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,970
you'll hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> about them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ID 2020 itself</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

425
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:26,350
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea to try and identify all those</font>

426
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:28,990
people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are currently not digital</font>

427
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:31,629
but um why it has to be on the block

428
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:33,790
chain they haven't explained somebody

429
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:35,319
got married I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think in Las Vegas and</font>

430
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:38,110
they put their marriage certificate on

431
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:40,029
the blockchain birth certificates on the

432
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:43,420
blockchain somebody said a

433
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:45,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">board-certified obstetrician at the</font>

434
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:48,759
birth will jump<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto a terminal and</font>

00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:34,210
people start to press back on the

457
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:37,840

day let's design something around

462

blockchain let's set out what problem

463
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:50,790
we're trying to solve and then say why

464
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:53,500
this massively redundant I'm

several parameters that Satoshi

discusses in the white paper and you

it's a distributed classic free

that it has solved this impossible

555
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:25,489

the key exchange problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> Alice and Bob</font>

00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,460
do you do that said that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Brits</font>

solved that problem in World War two in

00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,660
secret I don't know the first public

561

solution was Merkel<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ralph Merkle</font>

their lossing over the details then they

00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:52,940
can wind up as a side effect sharing a

567
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:55,280
key amazing completely stupid solves the

574
00:22:05,779 --> 00:22:10,709
RSA those three guys solved the key

00:22:09,329 --> 00:22:11,849
exchange problem with asymmetric

576

cryptography and they did it<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

577
00:22:11,849 --> 00:22:16,678
clever so I think that asymmetric

cryptography completely different by the

00:23:27,209 --> 00:23:32,009

wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve the double spin problem</font>

can join the Bitcoin network in<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact</font>

614
00:23:38,639 --> 00:23:42,119
it's really important that everybody

00:23:39,629 --> 00:23:44,339
does join the Bitcoin network the

616

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't want strangers we want</font>

to give them keys and we want to

provision them and do some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kyc one way</font>

the other you're shrinking the size of

623
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:03,059
the pool then if it's secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's secure</font>

624
00:24:01,619 --> 00:24:05,428
because you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> brute-force attack</font>

625
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:07,229
without controlling<font color="#CCCCCC"> 51% of the network</font>

626
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:09,570
well if the network is not tens of

627
00:24:07,229 --> 00:24:11,969
millions but it's hundreds then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 51%</font>

628
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:14,339
attack is a doddle and the whole

629
00:24:11,969 --> 00:24:15,749
security promise disappears so it's

630
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:17,700
another one of those things where block

631
00:24:15,749 --> 00:24:19,120
trainers it's been called math-based

632

00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:26,409
assumptions that nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> will ever</font>

637
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:30,760
assumptions are on a creaky and then

638
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,380
they become created by design when you

639
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:37,420
shrink the pool with a permission

640
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:39,190
trained as a designer it worries me that

641
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:43,030
this thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was put together in</font>

642
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:44,890
order to be trust less once you put

643
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:47,260
trust<font color="#CCCCCC"> onto it you're starting to upset</font>

644
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:48,970
the very foundations of the design and

645
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:51,610
this is not so much an academic problem

646
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:53,050
as just saying if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to unless</font>

647
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:55,510
tens of millions<font color="#E5E5E5"> of computers because</font>

648
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:56,740
you don't trust anybody but I by the way

649
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:59,170
we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to trust people by</font>

650
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:01,030
permission in them tens of millions of

651

computers is over engineered to say the

652
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:05,350

what are you doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the design</font>

662
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:27,240
itself is gone and if we're talking by

00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:30,280
design the challenge for anybody doing

<font color="#CCCCCC">Bitcoin and block chain spin-offs and</font>

666
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,900
you're trying to solve and be really

distributed ledger will solve it and

669
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,800
finally<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's some I talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

will the diamonds are only on the block

673
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:49,870
chain because somebody said steve has

674
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:52,890
diamond<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1234 bar-coded here's a piece of</font>

676
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:59,100
that makes the binding between me and

<font color="#E5E5E5">Mikey and mode and my physical diamond</font>

678
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:05,530
you can't make that binding on the block

679
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:08,530
chain so the block chain for anything

680
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:10,360
other than bitcoin bitcoin is the only

681
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:12,070
application that is trustless and all

00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:13,270

685
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,820

00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:20,919
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know what Satoshi said so</font>

putting my focus and where I recommend

705
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:03,770
people look is this big R&D consortium

706
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:07,189
and big labs that are being set up one

think NAB are actually Aussie members of

00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,660
that banking consortium but they've got

710
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,460
about a hundred million dollars and

711
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,870
they're solving some really important

712

problems with frictionless into back

713

stuff of front page<font color="#E5E5E5"> the economists right</font>

715
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,410
you don't get excited about frictionless

755
00:28:50,849 --> 00:28:53,428
bitcoin is going to change the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world but</font>

756
00:28:51,929 --> 00:28:54,659
I do believe in crypto currencies and I

757
00:28:53,429 --> 00:28:58,649
absolutely<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe that there will be</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">looks like thank you very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we've</font>

763
00:29:14,249 --> 00:29:18,149
got some time for questions from the

765

<font color="#CCCCCC">don't see the app but but I'd prefer to</font>

768
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:53,340
my viewers I've got to give you a

769
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:55,140
process question or a process answer I'm

770
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:56,399
afraid and I'm not here to endorse any

771
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:58,500
particular solution there's really good

772
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,450
work being done<font color="#CCCCCC"> by some of those big</font>

773

banks but the process<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer I have to</font>

774
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:05,010
give you as a designer is if<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

think that a private<font color="#E5E5E5"> block chain or a</font>

solve<font color="#E5E5E5"> your problems then by all means</font>

779
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:18,210
what my advice to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you is to go back work</font>

780
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:20,460
out what problems you trying to solve

781
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:22,500
work out what security<font color="#E5E5E5"> properties you're</font>

782
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:24,630
looking for we're at a security

783
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:27,960
conference right so confidentiality

784
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:31,530
integrity availability redundancy tamper

785
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:32,430
resistance key management sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

786
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:34,350
work out what the problems are that

787
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:36,480
you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to solve because that's</font>

788
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:38,520
the missing piece and I look at these

789
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:40,650
use cases that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are put up there with one</font>

790
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,389
sentence grabs like let's put land

791
00:30:40,650 --> 00:30:43,650
titles on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blockchain well I've</font>

792
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:46,740
actually been involved with electronic

793
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:48,330
conveyancing for nearly 20 years and key

794
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,710
management problems are hard one you

795
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:51,000
know you've got conveyancers you've got

796
00:30:49,710 --> 00:30:53,310
buyers you've got sellers you've got

797
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,960
real estate agents and and government

798
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:57,300
bureaucrats who all need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to</font>

799
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,210
participate<font color="#E5E5E5"> in an electronic system with</font>

800
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:01,800
with trust and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not the type of</font>

801
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:04,770
environment that block train was was

802
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:06,899
meant for<font color="#E5E5E5"> blockchain was expressly meant</font>

803
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:08,129
for those people to all know absolutely

804
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:11,070
nothing about each other so that they

805
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:12,900
can move<font color="#CCCCCC"> bitcoin around so there's two</font>

806
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:14,189
problems one if you are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

807
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,050
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin then let's</font>

808
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:18,210
be really careful about the analysis and

809
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:20,399
see if that leads you towards the BOP

810
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:22,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">train but the second thing is is key</font>

811
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:24,960
management and I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

812
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:26,520
you know this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most boring aspect</font>

813
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,860
of this but we are at all certain this

814
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:31,170
is important if you if you don't manage

815
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:34,560
the keys with which people are using

816
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:36,180
their wallets or or signing data in the

817
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:39,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">api's going onto the block</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chain if you</font>

818
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:42,090
don't manage those keys vowel things

819
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:44,880
futile just like them would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

820
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:46,770
sim card without key management so on

821
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,210
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sorry I can't specifically say</font>

822
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:52,260
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the particular insurers doing a</font>

823
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:53,580
good job I would commend an article that

824
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,500
was written by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Android colleague</font>

825
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,510
recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> apology's to call</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

826
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,250
competitors in the audience but Holly

827
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:00,500
wrote a really good paper for IT news a

828
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,270
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> days ago</font>

829
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:04,100
he said that um he actually went round

830
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:06,050
and interviewed a lot of bankers and he

831
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:07,850
distinctly and he captures the vibe that

832
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:10,430
a lot of bankers in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Australia is saying</font>

833
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:12,199
the coin yeah this is really this is

834
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:13,580
important but they won't be drawn on

835
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,830
what it means<font color="#CCCCCC"> for them yet and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

836
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:17,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">what you're seeing there is some is the</font>

837
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:19,760
dip in the hype cycle I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these</font>

838
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:22,520
people have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at this now for</font>

839
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:23,960
a year or two and they hard pressed to

840
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,150
find out what it actually means for them

841
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,770
in the financial<font color="#E5E5E5"> services sector that is</font>

842
00:32:26,150 --> 00:32:30,470
you know and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you characterize me as</font>

843
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:32,690
pessimistic and that's fair I am I think

844
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:34,400
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> 90 plugged and said everything you</font>

845
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:36,860
read about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the block train is wrong and</font>

846
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,210
you know I'll qualify that mean there's

847
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,709
some things<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're right but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

848
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:41,450
to get a headline I thought it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:42,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty good line I think that</font>

ninety-five percent of what your readers

851
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:48,440
is is wrong this book is just riddled

852
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:50,870
with errors so I am<font color="#E5E5E5"> upset about that but</font>

I<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely acknowledge the work that</font>

857
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:02,390
big teams of people that are coming from

the big into town and I commend our

859
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:07,070
threes blog the CTO of our three is a

guy<font color="#CCCCCC"> called Richard Brown I think any</font>

861
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:10,790
wrote a sensational blog about six weeks

862
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:12,860
ago explaining their first product and

863
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:18,139
how they went around designing it it's

864
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:21,500
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work I'm just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

865
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:25,570
randomly reward the proof of work right

866
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:25,570
so whoever works hardest will get

867
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:39,939
there's a few people doing that or um

868
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:43,210
catching the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wave</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of it life there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

869
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:45,580
still people retweeting like four weeks

870
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:48,070
after the story collapse still people

871
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:49,929
retweeting that that particular guy is

872
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:53,830
Nakamoto right so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font>

873
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:55,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">people that are just not up to date look</font>

874
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:56,649
less cynically I think that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

875
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">research in this area by governments</font>

876
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:00,400
really well warranted but if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a</font>

877
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:01,629
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this requires</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a judgment call and</font>

878
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:03,160
I wouldn't be putting a lot of money as

879
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:05,980
a government in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tubac train research per</font>

880
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:09,580
se it's something that people need to

881
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:11,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">watch really carefully but again I don't</font>

882
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:14,500
know when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about voting and you</font>

883
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:16,540
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about on land and health records</font>

884
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:19,810
the things that government have a stake

885
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:21,250
in odd when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you unpack it there's</font>

886
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:22,719
nothing to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> about blockchain that</font>

887
00:34:21,250 --> 00:34:26,260
actually jumps out as being important

888
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:27,879
you know I hear people the NHS or in

889
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:30,010
fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> the chief scientist</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the UK sis</font>

890
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">block chain health records encryption</font>

891
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,980
well there's no encryption the

892
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:34,870
blockchain there's no encryption in the

893
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,219
in the Satoshi white paper it's all

894
00:34:34,870 --> 00:34:38,469
about digital signatures encryption

895
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:40,839
comes later absolutely important but

896
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:43,270
once you start encrypting it changes the

897
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:44,590
architecture<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's not intrinsic to</font>

898
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:47,620
the architecture so when people guess

899
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:49,810
that we need encrypted health records

900
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:56,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">therefore blockchain well it's such a</font>

901
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:58,810
it's such an inept connection right and

902
00:34:56,409 --> 00:35:00,340
yeah and definitely let's be certifying

903
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:01,870
the obstetricians<font color="#E5E5E5"> that says you've just</font>

904
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:08,830
had a baby and you know that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

905
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:15,029
crowdsource medical credentials yes

906
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:15,029
that's 25<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bitcoin</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and a question</font>

907
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:28,609
yeah much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more interesting and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much more</font>

908
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:30,319
efficient and the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've heard</font>

909
00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:32,959
they're about to be announced from a

910
00:35:30,319 --> 00:35:40,219
company is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> algorithm that changes all</font>

911
00:35:32,959 --> 00:35:41,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">of that fundamentally yeah I mean I say</font>

912
00:35:40,219 --> 00:35:42,979
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of candid and</font>

913
00:35:41,719 --> 00:35:44,630
maybe I'm wrong I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind being wrong</font>

914
00:35:42,979 --> 00:35:45,890
but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that block chain and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Bitcoin</font>

915
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:47,089
as it exists today will just collapse

916
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:48,859
under its own weight in the next couple

917
00:35:47,089 --> 00:35:51,308
of years<font color="#E5E5E5"> and be replaced</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by something</font>

918
00:35:48,859 --> 00:35:54,589
that's generation<font color="#CCCCCC"> to and a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot smarter</font>

919
00:35:51,309 --> 00:35:57,410
no but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is sort of important</font>

920
00:35:54,589 --> 00:35:58,849
because if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a bit schizo about</font>

921
00:35:57,410 --> 00:36:01,660
this with the greatest<font color="#E5E5E5"> respect to the</font>

922
00:35:58,849 --> 00:36:04,009
poor person I refer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that before</font>

923
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,930
the futurists are saying the blockchain

924
00:36:04,009 --> 00:36:07,160
the block train as it exists<font color="#E5E5E5"> today is</font>

925
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:09,078
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> change the world for all of</font>

926
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:10,308
these reasons and it's kind of

927
00:36:09,079 --> 00:36:12,049
embarrassing to think that it might not

928
00:36:10,309 --> 00:36:14,180
be that one and that we might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to go</font>

929
00:36:12,049 --> 00:36:17,719
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and download something else and</font>

930
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:19,339
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> again and that's fine but my</font>

931
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:22,640
observation is that you need to as a

932
00:36:19,339 --> 00:36:24,739
futurist you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really on your</font>

933
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,660
backing and at the moment a lot of the

934
00:36:24,739 --> 00:36:28,190
people are in no man's land they they

935
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:33,558
think that it's the current technology a

936
00:36:28,190 --> 00:36:35,150
paper over its inadequacies a paper over

937
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:36,349
that it's being pressed to do something

938
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:38,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it wasn't designed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that's a</font>

939
00:36:36,349 --> 00:36:40,160
more objective way of saying it and

940
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:42,709
these second and<font color="#E5E5E5"> third generation things</font>

941
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,690
will be utterly<font color="#CCCCCC"> different so we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

942
00:36:42,709 --> 00:36:46,339
of crystal boiling what's going to

943
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:48,109
happen based on algorithm today that is

944
00:36:46,339 --> 00:36:50,558
not sustainable and I think that's a bit

945
00:36:48,109 --> 00:36:50,558
of a mug's game

946
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:18,520
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> history of all time yeah it's the</font>

947
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:20,470
sort of sadist one yeah the silliest one

948
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:24,820
has got to be birth certificates in the

949
00:37:20,470 --> 00:37:26,859
blockchain that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just daft to me for</font>

950
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:28,360
every reason well actually now there's

951
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:30,340
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even sillier and I've</font>

952
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:31,870
got when I got into this<font color="#E5E5E5"> about three</font>

953
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:35,200
years ago I started bookmarking some

954
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:36,880
stuff and then I had you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know blockchain</font>

955
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,529
reports and then I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> block chain hype</font>

956
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:41,800
and then I've got a folder<font color="#CCCCCC"> that goes</font>

957
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:43,180
beyond hype into just and it's not it's

958
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:45,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">not the offensive word i think i call it</font>

959
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:48,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">watch-chain lunacy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about 10</font>

00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:50,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 old bookmarks and that and one of</font>

961
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:52,240
them is a company that thinks that

962
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,250
counterfeit luxury goods is an important

963
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,379
problem and it is i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

964
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:58,420
change the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> but so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> particular</font>

965
00:37:56,380 --> 00:38:00,550
company in New York says that they

966
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:02,950
happened to be RFID tags now in<font color="#E5E5E5"> three</font>

967
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:04,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">hundred dollar gym boots and to stop the</font>

968
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:05,770
counterfeiting of three hundred dollars

969
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,070
in boots we're going to put those RFID

970
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:12,220
tags on the book train and they raised

971
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:13,570
1.2 million dollars for their startup

972
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:16,899
company so that that's the most

973
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:19,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">offensive thing I've hits I'm getting</font>

974
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:21,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the UM the wave so thank you very much</font>

975
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:21,750
everybody

00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,460
you
