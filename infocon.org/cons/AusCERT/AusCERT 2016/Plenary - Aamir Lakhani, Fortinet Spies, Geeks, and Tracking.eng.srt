56
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,010
few years ago to talk to before

57
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,020
our director of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the FBI</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Robbie Mueller</font>

58
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:18,850
and he said there's two types of people

59
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:21,370
out there those that have been hacked

60
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,750
and those I will be hacked I actually

61
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,920
told him I<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually think there's two</font>

62
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,260
types of people out there those that

63
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,369
have been hacked and really those that

64
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,160
have been hacked and just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

65
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:31,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">yet now if you think about it like when</font>

66
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,060
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> write when I do breach investigations</font>

67
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:36,130
I'm not normally a speaker I actually go

68
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:37,990
out and do investigations and help our

69
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,820
customers with breaches and when I do

70
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:42,040
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> usually find most attackers are</font>

71
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:43,989
in networks for about 200 days at least

72
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's the average I saw in the last 15</font>

73
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,950
breaches or so that I saw in

74
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,630
investigations that I did now if you

75
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:51,880
think about an attacker in your house

76
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:54,730
for 200 days while you're sleeping

77
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:56,170
eating breathing that that's insane but

78
00:02:54,730 --> 00:03:00,730
that's what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on in the real world</font>

79
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:02,170
our data is very insecure I always hear

80
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,600
about like<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these numbers people</font>

81
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:07,690
throw out about data but I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

82
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:09,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">how insecure data really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was I decided</font>

83
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,829
to purchase them as a project<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a</font>

84
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:13,570
pet project now<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> danette we do all</font>

85
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:15,250
these different projects<font color="#E5E5E5"> as reverse</font>

86
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:17,320
engineering and looking at malware

87
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,820
looking at attack campaigns and that's

88
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,530
great but I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how much I</font>

89
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:22,900
could hack without doing any hacking at

90
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:24,820
all I just wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to buy old hoarder and</font>

91
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,320
see all the data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we leave behind in</font>

92
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:29,410
our lives that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really think</font>

93
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:31,540
about I always heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> about people buying</font>

94
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:33,040
old horror heard about talks by never

95
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:35,010
really knew anyone that did it so I was

96
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,290
like let me do it and see what happens

97
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:40,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">and here's the story</font>

98
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,060
now i just realized i spelled

99
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,200
engineering wrong but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say</font>

100
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:10,240
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we spell it in Texas so</font>

101
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,920
that's ok as a pet project what I ended

102
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:13,420
up doing was I ended<font color="#CCCCCC"> up wanting to see</font>

103
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,549
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of data we left behind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so I</font>

104
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:18,729
decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 hard drives and</font>

105
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,870
about for mobile phones now on the 10th

106
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,610
hard drives that I bought I actually

107
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,410
found out you know you know I targeted

108
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:24,970
individuals i went to ebay and i

109
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:26,740
targeted companies that were reselling

110
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:28,480
hardware fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> i found one company</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

111
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:30,040
was specialized in reselling old

112
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,540
government hardware so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was like oh</font>

113
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,400
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> should be pretty clean right i mean</font>

114
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:37,000
you can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> really too much stuff out</font>

115
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:39,330
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was really surprised in fact if</font>

116
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">you find a far drive with term papers</font>

117
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:43,570
pornography and and malware you can

118
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:46,929
pretty much bet it came from a college

119
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:48,400
computer right i also found out of

120
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,420
mobile phones and mobile phones i

121
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,799
thought you know once<font color="#E5E5E5"> you hit the race</font>

122

are completely tracking you all the time

173
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:38,830
physically in fact if you go to frequent

174
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,840
locations on your phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> you might find</font>

175
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,969
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> turned on and what you'll probably</font>

176
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:47,460
find is your location on places that

177
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:49,810
you've gone to at work and at home

178
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:51,580
android is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the exact same way it's</font>

179
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:56,380
always tracking your information as well

180
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:58,330
I was like<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does this happen right</font>

181
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,889
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wanted</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to search up for</font>

182
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,500
common flashlight<font color="#E5E5E5"> apps I wanted to see</font>

183
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:03,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">how badass for so I get to the searching</font>

184
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,680
you can do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same search on your phone</font>

185
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">and just search for flashlight apps we</font>

186
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,880
probably all have a flashlight app and

187
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:11,109
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the top results that came up</font>

188
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,719
when we actually start looking at the

189
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:15,729
permissions on these applications I

190
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:18,220
wonder why our flashlight apps actually

191
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:21,010
need precise GPS locations and the

192
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:24,070
ability to install software yes this

193
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:27,969
turned out<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be malware in the Android</font>

194
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:29,409
Play Store now<font color="#CCCCCC"> during the course of this</font>

195
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:31,810
investigation I just couldn't play

196
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:33,070
around I had a day job as well and law

197
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,930
enforcement came to me and said hey

198
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:36,699
we're tracking a criminal he's using<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

199
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:38,050
burner phone and while i was doing this

200
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:39,430
project<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wonder I said I wonder what I</font>

201
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:41,680
could do with social media<font color="#CCCCCC"> apps and</font>

202
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:44,229
social apps that automatically upload

203
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,789
information on your device so all i had

204
00:07:44,229 --> 00:07:47,859
was a phone number i decided to put that

205
00:07:45,789 --> 00:07:49,870
in my contacts and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then i downloaded</font>

206
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,820
apps like Instagram and Facebook and

207
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,289
when you launch these apps they nicely

208
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:54,940
ask you do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> upload</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

209
00:07:53,289 --> 00:07:57,340
contacts to see if you know anyone I

person's profile on the burner phone in

212
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:03,490

00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:08,229
with that and you get their profile

216
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,549
information the person doesn't get any

217

me more you yours may be more

235
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:52,720
embarrassing and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look</font>

236
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:54,069
at their directory listings a lot of

237
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,690
interesting information like login

238
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,580
information affiliate information and

239
00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:01,150

00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,260
movies ever made right as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> CSV file if</font>

241
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,730
anyone wants that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will be around</font>

242
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:09,910

245
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,699
on there what I also found is like

246
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:17,859
applications these days like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

247
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,970
download on our phones and a photobucket

248
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,500
was a good example if you have

249
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:22,990
photobucket and you download<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on</font>

250
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,850
your phone it automatically uploads all

251
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:27,490
your recent<font color="#CCCCCC"> photos that you take from</font>

252
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:29,500
your camera roll publicly if you do a

253
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:31,840
Google search to photobucket recent

254
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:34,390
uploads you will see everyone's recent

255
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,950
uploads and you'll quickly spot<font color="#E5E5E5"> up some</font>

257
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:41,170
uploads automatically upload it and a

258
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,820
photobucket is just one example there's

259
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:44,260
other examples after as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did</font>

260
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:46,510
contact photobucket<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask them to change</font>

261
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:48,400
this as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as some other other sites</font>

262
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:49,810
as well but you can still go to

263
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,280
photobucket and you'll learn your

264
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:53,469
techniques you'll learn how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to how to</font>

265
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:55,600
click on someone's profile and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

266

267
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,630
be at the batting beginning of the

293
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:52,930
name address and everything else on him

294
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:54,340
my buddy in law enforcement was like

295
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:57,219
this is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting can I can I get</font>

296
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:58,540
a copy about those pictures a few days

297
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:03,460
later I did not see his profile on

298
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:04,900
photobucket anymore now here's some

299
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:06,250
other examples that I found you know I

300
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:08,620
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> people taking pictures of their</font>

303
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:14,260

304
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:15,910
wasn't too sure I had to actually call a

305
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,890
law enforcement but I started noticing a

306
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:20,260
theme over several weekends and this

307
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:21,730
theme that I noticed was on Friday

308
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:23,670
nights I saw people taking pictures of

309
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:26,670
money I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> before they were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going out</font>

310
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:28,959
Saturday mornings money and beer and

311
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">Sunday money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> beer in babies and it</font>

312
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,620
actually happened on multiple profiles

313
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:37,270
like like 20 30 profiles so not really

314
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:39,010
too sure what was going on there now

315
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:41,410
ever since banking applications became

316
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:43,300
popular we're all taking pictures of our

317
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:44,980
checks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> other credit cards and</font>

330
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:15,940

335
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,040

this as far as to talk but you know it's

461
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,290
all about the information<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

that information and that's that's what

00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,150
we try and do right we try and spread

474
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:15,000
all about visibility and the example<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

475
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:17,130
give and it really doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter what</font>

476
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,109
vendor are you using or who using right

477
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:20,280
it's all about visibility and what you

478
00:17:19,109 --> 00:17:24,569
can do with that visibility

479
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:26,819
in 1666 Isaac Newton invented the prison

480
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:29,909
and he was the first one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> found out</font>

00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:31,980
that light visible light sunlight was

482
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:34,890
more than just white light it was made

483
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:36,810
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> of multiple colors and it was the</font>

00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:39,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">first time we knew that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it wasn't</font>

485
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:42,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">until the 1800s until joseph baena</font>

487
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:47,159
mixed up invented the spectroscope and

488
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:49,020
the spectroscope was the first time we

489
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:52,410
found out that light had application it

490
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:53,670
had action that light could be separated

491
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:56,850
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they could be used for devices like</font>

MRIs and x-rays we<font color="#E5E5E5"> always say this</font>

493
00:17:56,850 --> 00:18:00,689
without action without visibility you

494
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:05,880
have to have action intelligence and

495
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:08,460
action has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to go together so not only</font>

516
00:18:56,340 --> 00:19:04,860
haha anyway you spoke mainly about

517
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:06,330
personal data and devices there does

518
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,219
they have straight up applications to

519
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:10,139
them<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> larger</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> scale corporate world that</font>

520
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,700
sort of stuff as well absolutely so what

521
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,320
we're finding is that the personal you

522
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,540
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> peripheral data that's where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

523
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,030
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of notice when data is missing I</font>

524
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:19,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">always</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say you know the example that I</font>

525
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:22,080
gave about corporate security is is

526
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:24,510
target and I use this example with a few

527
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,790
people last night targeted in the US was

528
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:28,470
was the first time we had a major

529
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:31,080
organization that was breached with a

530
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:32,310
credit card bridge now my mom had never

531
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,960
been breached with a credit card<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> she</font>

532
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:36,060
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a letter in the mail saying hey my</font>

533
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,860
credit card is a stolen I need a new

534
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,659
credit card she's like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> never want to</font>

535
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,340
shop at Target again I just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

536
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do it and I always used to tell mom</font>

537
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:43,770
you don't have to worry about target

538
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,780
they probably had better corporate

539
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:47,310
security now than anyone else right but

540
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:49,170
I always<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell people you don't want to</font>

541
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">argue with mom especially if you're</font>

542
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:52,350
Indian you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not argue with mom you</font>

543
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">just don't do it right or show so I told</font>

544
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,980
you're a year right but you know we

545
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:57,660
started noticing<font color="#E5E5E5"> target as a corporation</font>

546
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,940
as the organization the reputation

547
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:00,780
started decreasing their sales started

548
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,630
decreasing they're doing a lot better

549
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:05,100
now but when when data is personal and

550
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:06,510
you do relate data to personal in it

551
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:09,360
it's a lot easier for<font color="#CCCCCC"> me to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

552
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:10,980
enterprises and CEOs and CISOs around

553
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,750
why why this data may affect them and

554
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:13,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">their business and their enterprise give</font>
