<font color="#CCCCCC">hospital not paying its electricity bill</font>

119

127
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:41,258
confusing i'm not quite sure whether

128
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:44,080
you're supposed to pay or not supposed

129
00:04:41,259 --> 00:04:46,569

186
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:10,090
clarify and call it what it is we're

193
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:30,880

281
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,380
clear I'm not saying that encryptions

bad or it should be banned or weak and

283
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,170
because of terrorism I think if we give

00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,959
terrorism to deny it is deceitful and

287
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:24,310
I'll explain encryption<font color="#CCCCCC"> Abel's terrorism</font>

never ever did any terrorism there you

still yes everyone knows everyone knows

374
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:28,149
from primary school every debate at some

375

for the needy take it away Troy<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

defense so thank you very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much that</font>

381
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:42,040
still so opponents of terrorism are

382
00:14:39,309 --> 00:14:43,600
arguing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> encryption is going to</font>

383
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,160
enable terrorism and it really it's just

384
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,110
not the case so have a think about you

385
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,579
got terrorists one he goes let's blow

386
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:50,379
some up and then we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk over an</font>

388
00:14:50,379 --> 00:14:53,889
well unfortunately encryption has been

389
00:14:52,269 --> 00:14:55,480
banned and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> geico will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just go</font>

390
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:57,850
do something else like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is not the</font>

00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:02,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">all we saw the Paris attacks everything</font>

393
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:03,790
was done over SMS totally non encrypted

394
00:15:02,019 --> 00:15:06,040
channels everybody got very upset

395
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:08,110
recently about the San Bernardino phone

396
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,459
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they couldn't decrypt it after</font>

397
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:11,050
they had already shot all these people

398
00:15:09,459 --> 00:15:12,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">that happened already before the</font>

399
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:14,280
encryption<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a problem</font>

400
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:16,110
encryption is not the problem that

401
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,780
enables terrorism terrorists<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

402
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:21,600
problem of terrorism there you go<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

403
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:23,550
the affirmative Edward Justin and still

404
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,080
the negative Steve David and Troy go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

405
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:26,849
your appt vote affirmative or negative

406
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:28,650
lock them in now I'll give you 20

407
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:33,870
seconds let's have a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the poll as</font>

408
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:36,300
it evolves can I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> something about</font>

about discouragement as troy stetina the

410
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,329
terrorists are looking at encryption

411
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,310
going we better give up now it's a bit

412
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:42,930
like when sarbanes-oxley came in and

413
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,459
they they put all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this extra process</font>

on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> white collar criminals and they</font>

415

followed by Troy and still the negative

433
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:47,339
time will be David L Nigel and just and

434
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,170
so it would take it away if it doesn't

435
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:51,240
have a name<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a logo it's not a real</font>

it couldn't get any traction on was

486
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:45,899
interested because it was boring and

487
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,670
then he got a logo and he<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a website</font>

488
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,710
and he called an image tragic and

489
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:51,330
suddenly everyone paid attention because

490
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:53,070
suddenly people started caring about it

thereafter folks I put it to you

768
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:50,010
privacy's been dead for years because we

769
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:52,040
can't risk it the only privacy left is

770
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:56,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">that which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> inside of our head and</font>

had the first privacy is dead myth

776
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:11,100
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Polaroid gold portable</font>

privacy get over it it's a rhetorical

784
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,209
position if anybody says to you the

785
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:28,830
privacy is dead they're trying to sell

you something it's either sneakers or

787
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:35,340
its internet service or it's a political

philosophy of some sort if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer to</font>

a rhetorical question is privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> is dead</font>

790
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:42,990
if the answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been rhetorically know</font>

791
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:45,150
then that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the truth you know today</font>

792
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:47,040
your thermostat has got a privacy policy

793
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:49,890
your Barbie doll has got a privacy

794
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:51,450
policy and it all seems too hard but

795
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:53,040
it's not hard to stand up for privacy

00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,000
wouldn't know what to do with the bird

816
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:35,830
so like my dog Cindy and the birds like

me and attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a female if we got</font>

what to do with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we've got</font>

back and take away the ability for us to

high school that's 90 91 so that's 35

853
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:43,240
years I've never heard the phrase bangin

854
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:45,520
plate of eggs benny used in a debate so

855
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:48,520
thank you so much for that Justin Darren

856
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:51,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're on the negative take it away so</font>

857
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:53,440
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> is privacy if you ask the</font>

858
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:55,510
merriam-webster dictionary it is the

859
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:57,700
state<font color="#CCCCCC"> of being free from public</font>

860
00:33:55,510 --> 00:34:00,430
attention and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the word</font>

861
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:03,460
privacy in literature over the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> 200</font>

862
00:34:00,430 --> 00:34:07,210
years it just makes his absolute hockey

863
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:09,460
stick around nineteen sixty it was

864
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:12,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely static for all of that time</font>

865
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:16,810
until suddenly it just nearly quadruples

866
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:18,969
and why is that what changed technology

867
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:20,799
changed you see curtains may have been

868
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:25,719
sufficient in the past to protect one's

869
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:29,440
privacy but today we're protecting our

870
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:31,520
privacy with technol

871
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,080

00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:41,929
for well it means better information

876
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:44,300

the Honorable Wilson to my immediate

884
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:04,790

full of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> whole lot of rhetorical</font>

questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you what's wrong</font>

Honorable American down the the American

anyway he mentioned curtains curtains

890
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:24,800
are also a middle-class affectation and

893
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:30,440
can hear the neighbors fighting you knew

894
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">that young sajeev had been out too late</font>

one night and his parents<font color="#E5E5E5"> were paying</font>

896
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:36,920
about privacy only happened when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

897
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:39,080
heard the middle class in two cities and

898
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:41,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">they built their own little castles</font>

00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:44,870
their own little kingdoms they're

900
00:35:41,810 --> 00:35:47,299
environmentally unsound privacy is not

901
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:50,720
just a middle-class affectation it is

902
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:56,000
environmental vandalism thank you there

903
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:57,770
you go I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't believe we had to</font>

904
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,600
wait so long in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this debate for such an</font>

905
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:01,820
obvious argument to be raised but anyway

906
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:04,040
just and wrap it up for us on the

907
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:05,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">negative so I'm on the negative yet</font>

908
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:10,220
again i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure what i'll sit think</font>

909
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:13,850
of me anyway i tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to crowdsource this</font>

910
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:15,680
because everything to do with this

911
00:36:13,850 --> 00:36:17,299
question seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> so obvious</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me it</font>

912
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,000
fosters me that you even have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> debate</font>

913
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:22,100
it the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> got was take your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> clothes</font>

914
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:27,740
off on stage and say you don't want to

915
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:31,549
have to see this to you so rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> than</font>

916
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:34,549
subject you to that awesomeness<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll say</font>

917
00:36:31,550 --> 00:36:38,780
the privacy is an innate thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's we</font>

918
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:41,060
require it as humans it's part of us we

919
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:45,260
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to choose when and to whom</font>

920
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:47,240
we reveal secrets to exist in society we

921
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:49,250
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep that so when Justin says</font>

922
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:51,049
that yeah that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to share yes we</font>

923
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:53,300
do but we need to choose when to share

924
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:59,090
and taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> away privacy doesn't give you</font>

925
00:36:53,300 --> 00:37:02,480
that so that's it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for me really and I'm</font>

928
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,770

note that there's an O in the topics I

world fell into a time of superstition

1020
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:05,040
because all real scientific knowledge

1021
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:07,410
was lost these days security people copy

1022

1031
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:39,930

1032
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:41,940
the dark ages that we have in the modern

1033

00:41:55,530 --> 00:42:00,420
made it pretty clear actually that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1037
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:02,280
one but I did get that I i think is

1038
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:04,230
worth reiterating is that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dark</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ages</font>

1039
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:07,020

1040
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:10,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">there 400 AD onwards and there was his</font>

1041
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:11,670
cultural and economic deterioration we

1042
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:13,740
are not in a period of economic

1043
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:15,300
deterioration as far as<font color="#CCCCCC"> apset goes you</font>

1044
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,859
if you're a knapsack at the moment out

there you are having a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> bloody good</font>

1046
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:20,940
time of it most<font color="#E5E5E5"> likely it is a really</font>

1047
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:23,220
good time because everything is

1048
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:25,230
connected and everything is broken we

1049
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:27,029
even have connected toilets now there is

1050
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:28,430
a connected toilet from Japan we're all

1051

good toilet things come from and

<font color="#CCCCCC">Trustwave had to issue a security</font>

1054
00:42:32,010 --> 00:42:35,760
vulnerability in the toilet so we are in

backdoored by your toilet which<font color="#CCCCCC"> hahaha</font>

1057
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,120
