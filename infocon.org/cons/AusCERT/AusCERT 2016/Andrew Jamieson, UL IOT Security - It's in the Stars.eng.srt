11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:35,339
please welcome to the stage Andrew

00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:38,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">Jamison hello everybody happy to hear me</font>

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">about IOT obviously a theme</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for asset</font>

16
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:49,890
ubiquitous I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ot's everywhere i'll try</font>

17
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,930
not to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use too many peas and kind of</font>

18
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:53,789
bounces off the mic<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

19
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:56,039
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit controversial and some of the</font>

20
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,420
things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm saying i have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

21
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,699
controversial views and a controversial

22
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,949
sort of guy but I figured I'd start off

23
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:03,358
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most controversial question</font>

24
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:07,649
right let's don't get it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of the way</font>

25
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">so does it make me look fat on this</font>

26
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:12,390
stage was expecting a bigger stage I

27
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,490
don't know but the question then is how

28
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:16,159
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> do you think I wink I mean people</font>

29
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,169
wear different things but you can

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,220
objectively make an assessment could be

31
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:23,369
wrong i hope it's wrong at the time

32
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:27,360
about my weight how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that how</font>

33
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:30,479
are you able to objectively assess my

34
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,549
weight you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do that because we have</font>

35
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:37,740
units of measurements we have metrics

36
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:39,720
for weight<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so those metrics based</font>

37
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,210
primarily on this for weight this is

38
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:46,048
what's called the one kilogram prototype

39
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,579
it is a lump of metal it's based around

40
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:49,530
various places you can see them in

41
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:52,829
museums and so forth platinum iridium

42
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:55,950
alloy<font color="#CCCCCC"> ba-ba-ba-ba ultimately this is the</font>

43
00:01:52,829 --> 00:01:59,789
way we can all say you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I way you</font>

44
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:03,390
know as felt 70 kilos based on the fact

45
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:08,160
that we all<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what a kilo is because</font>

46
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:10,020
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the metrics to do that question</font>

47
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,420
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> question for the audience and the</font>

48
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:13,610
question for this particular topic how

49
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:18,450
we measure

50
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:21,209
if we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to have an assessment of</font>

51
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,319
security systems we need to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

52
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:24,720
measure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it we need to be able to</font>

53
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,179
understand when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we say something is</font>

54
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,849
secure what we mean by<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or when we</font>

55
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,860
have two different people<font color="#E5E5E5"> two different</font>

56
00:02:28,849 --> 00:02:33,629
organizations two different

57
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:35,640
methodologies of looking at something we

58
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:37,560
can compare the two and say well if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

59
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,040
system says it's secure this other

60
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">system should do the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing</font>

61
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,900
ultimately we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> define this</font>

62
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:48,839
methodology and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have some</font>

63
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:51,690
acceptable level of risk based on this

64
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:54,480
methodology now we've got security

65
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:56,780
evaluations already so how do we do this

66
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,780
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we do this in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the existing</font>

67
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:03,239
methodologies that we have well<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's</font>

68
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,209
look at those so here I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

69
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:09,180
a plane and you've got at the top a

70
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:11,790
formalized methodology and coming down

71
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:14,870
the axis their informal across the

72
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:17,970
horizontal individually defined risk and

73
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:20,730
formally or externally defined risk and

74
00:03:17,970 --> 00:03:23,940
if we look at the types of security

75
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:27,630
evaluations that are common<font color="#E5E5E5"> today come</font>

76
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:31,230
criteria<font color="#CCCCCC"> phipps 140s 0134 91 or sorry</font>

77
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:33,599
yeah 13 491 pts penetration testing I've

78
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:35,130
been involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in all of these one way or</font>

79
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,649
another usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing assessments on</font>

80
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:40,910
them so how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they fit into this plane</font>

81
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:43,079
well common criteria is very formalized

82
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:45,239
because of that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually quite</font>

83
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:48,540
expensive and takes an awfully long time

84
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:50,190
it is very structured it goes through

85
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:52,069
what's called a certification body which

86
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:54,690
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> generally the information security</font>

87
00:03:52,069 --> 00:03:56,130
organization within that government that

88
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:59,489
it's being done in<font color="#E5E5E5"> within that country</font>

89
00:03:56,130 --> 00:04:01,590
it takes a very long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> costs a lot of</font>

90
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,980
money<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was at a cryptographic module</font>

91
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,530
conference just last week in Canada and

92
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:09,590
everybody was talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about how</font>

93
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:12,989
difficult time-consuming and costly

94
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:14,910
security evaluations are because they

95
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:16,380
take this amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time they cost this</font>

96
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:19,798
amount of money because they're very

97
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:22,710
formalized<font color="#CCCCCC"> fips 140-2 also very</font>

98
00:04:19,798 --> 00:04:25,169
formalized interestingly enough the risk

99
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,010
is quite individual they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

100
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:28,919
have a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of men</font>

101
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:31,170
tricks in that system but they do have

102
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:33,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">statements such as it shall be secure</font>

103
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:38,040
which is great<font color="#E5E5E5"> what exactly</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> does secure</font>

104
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:39,780
mean I saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1349 one kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of sits in the</font>

105
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,120
middle a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit because you don't</font>

106
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,799
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot of metrics in it you</font>

107
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:46,350
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a formalized methodology</font>

108
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,720
there are no testing requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> PTS</font>

109
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:51,600
which is a system<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I use quite often</font>

110
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,240
for banking devices a little bit more

111
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,520
formal little bit less costly than

112
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,840
common criteria although to be honest

113
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,580
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you it's kind of merging with</font>

114
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,320
common criteria in a large way at the

115
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:03,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">moment becoming more costly more</font>

116
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:07,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">time-consuming and then penetration</font>

117
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:09,150
testing varies greatly depending on who

118
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:11,490
you're doing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wears depending on what</font>

119
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,820
you're testing you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

120
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:16,470
formalized methodologies around this or

121
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:21,000
alternatively it can be very subjective

122
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:24,720
and very informal so these sorts of

123
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,230
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> then define how the methodology</font>

124
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,880
is performed but then there is the

125
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:32,460
question of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> threats so we talked</font>

126
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,850
about methodologies with threats from my

127
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:37,739
point of view I like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of</font>

128
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:39,870
security problems in three ways i like

129
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,030
to call it security DIY three types of

130
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:45,060
security problems they're deliberate

131
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:47,880
problems these are the back doors that

132
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:51,090
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> bake into systems because they</font>

133
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:53,580
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have access later on in the best</font>

134
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:56,460
possible light you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could say that people</font>

135
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:58,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">do this because they want to enable</font>

136
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,750
features later<font color="#E5E5E5"> on they want to upload</font>

137
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,780
code so forth certainly not saying

138
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:06,530
that's a good thing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> often it is so</font>

139
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:10,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">that others can get access</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maliciously</font>

140
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:12,690
surreptitiously ignorant then ignorant

141
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:14,460
problems and these are the majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

142
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:16,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">the problems that we see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in my opinion</font>

143
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:19,440
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where you have poor security</font>

144
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,510
settings and configurations often it's

146
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:27,599
consumers life easier to make the

00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:34,260

148
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:38,430
feature risk risk rich sorry but often

149
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:39,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">as you add features as you add functions</font>

150
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,770
as

151
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,750
you add new things you<font color="#CCCCCC"> increase the</font>

152
00:06:41,770 --> 00:06:46,330
attack surface of the device<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

153
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:50,710
increase potential full security

154
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:53,770
problems yet to be discovered so the why

155
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:56,500
of security DIY this is where you have

156
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:59,140
problems you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know about yet and as</font>

157
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:02,580
we know security problems in devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

158
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:06,340
systems in software come up all the time

159
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:09,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">people find new methodologies of attacks</font>

160
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:13,000
new classifications of attacks new ways

161
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:16,090
to attack things and this then requires

162
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,140
that you must continually maintain your

163
00:07:16,090 --> 00:07:22,060
systems so how then do we currently

164
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:26,349
address these problems in systems that

165
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:27,610
we have at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the moment so deliberate code</font>

166
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:29,170
review if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to find a</font>

167
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,460
backdoor really the only way you're

168
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:32,890
going to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's by looking</font>

169
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,450
through the code and hunting for it sure

170
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,159
you can fuzz it a little bit but

171
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:37,539
generally code review is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be the</font>

172
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,580
way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

173
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:42,460
there how do you find the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems of</font>

174
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:45,250
ignorance well code review again yes but

175
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:48,370
also penetration testing fuzzing you try

176
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:50,740
and find the incorrect the poor

177
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:53,350
configurations that have been set up how

178
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:56,830
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we address that why the yet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

179
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:58,930
discovered well for prayer we can hope

180
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:04,030
that they don't come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then we</font>

181
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:07,390
patch later on security evaluations then

182
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:09,640
in my mind have three defining<font color="#E5E5E5"> features</font>

183
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:11,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">I talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> threats three</font>

184
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:15,400
features of security evaluations they

185
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:19,450
take time they cost money and they

186
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:23,349
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> fail what I mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> by that is there</font>

187
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:25,750
not a set and<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget' type of system you</font>

188
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:28,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't do a security evaluation and then</font>

189
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:30,669
walk away saying that<font color="#E5E5E5"> product is secure</font>

190
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:33,849
you do it saying I've done the best I

191
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:35,919
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> within</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a time and cost budget I have</font>

192
00:08:33,849 --> 00:08:37,570
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number of vulnerabilities or not</font>

193
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,699
and they've been remediated hopefully

194
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,349
but at some point in the future and it

195
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,140
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a second you walk away</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

196
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:47,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">that system a new vulnerability will</font>

197
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:51,520
come up and that system<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no longer</font>

198
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:52,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">secure so okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I've talked a lot about</font>

199
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:55,510
security testing and so for

200
00:08:52,930 --> 00:09:00,089
how does this fit in with IOT well let's

201
00:08:55,510 --> 00:09:03,910
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> OT devices are becoming</font>

202
00:09:00,089 --> 00:09:06,160
smarter now a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this is based on</font>

203
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,529
the fact that processing elements are

204
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,170
becoming smaller cheaper less

205
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:15,189
power-hungry when I was designing

206
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:18,490
devices back in I won't mention gears

207
00:09:15,190 --> 00:09:22,209
but a long<font color="#CCCCCC"> time ago 8-bit processors</font>

208
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:25,180
used to cost a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> money now I'm</font>

209
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:28,359
amazed when I do evaluations on products

210
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:30,550
how cheap security processes are and

211
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,700
their security processes you then look

212
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:36,130
at general-purpose processes they are

213
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:38,800
remarkably cheap and with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can</font>

214
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:41,649
enable all sorts of wonderful features

215
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,630
and functions and products to do strange

216
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:45,820
and unusual things as part of these

217
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:48,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">slides I decided I was going to try and</font>

218
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:50,589
google the most ridiculous<font color="#E5E5E5"> IOT things I</font>

219
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:53,640
could think of so I thought I know

220
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:56,770
connected nappies well they exist

221
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:59,380
connected kettles they exist connected

222
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:01,060
cat litter boxes sure why not so you

223
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,850
know when your cat's going to do a poo

224
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's important funny thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

225
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,290
connected toasters which is often the

226
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,660
one that people<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about actually not</font>

227
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:12,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">so many this is a concept of one there</font>

228
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,380
which I quite like it prints out the

229
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:16,720
weather<font color="#E5E5E5"> but everything is getting</font>

230
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:19,209
connected because vendors are trying to

231
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:23,950
differentiate their products based on

232
00:10:19,209 --> 00:10:25,930
features so it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font>

233
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:29,709
mean features are great new things are

234
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:31,569
great why is that a security issue why

235
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:32,920
can't they just bake in security we saw

236
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:35,350
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last presentation one of the</font>

237
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,779
questions why isn't security just baked

238
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:39,910
in at the start<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyway one of the</font>

239
00:10:37,779 --> 00:10:43,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">problems then the major problem that I</font>

240
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:45,670
see is that as well as trying to

241
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:48,490
differentiate their products based on

242
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:50,649
features the design prototype and

243
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:55,990
production cycles are getting compressed

244
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:59,290
and this reduces the amount of time that

245
00:10:55,990 --> 00:11:02,230
the vendors have to test for and

246
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:04,420
remediate vulnerabilities I see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

247
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:06,370
the security industry when I work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

248
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:08,410
people who make products

249
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:11,260
designed specifically with security in

250
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:12,880
mind they still have end dates and they

251
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:15,550
say I've got to go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> market date on</font>

252
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:19,660
this day I need to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I've had</font>

00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:21,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">people in the lab coding up new releases</font>

254
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:24,310
of code as we found problems with it

255
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:26,560
every day so they can hit their go to

256
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:29,310
market date now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a problem for</font>

257
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:32,410
people who are making security devices

258
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:35,109
it's an even bigger<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

259
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:37,660
who are making commercial devices where

260
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:40,180
they're intending to sell millions of

261
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:43,089
products and therefore their margins are

262
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:47,170
razor thin and every day<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not on</font>

00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:54,640
necessarily differentiate products based

266
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:56,170
on security sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of talks</font>

267
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:57,730
about security and says it's important

268
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:59,860
and you know we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> concerned</font>

269
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,020
about it but I'm not completely

270
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:05,190
convinced that when it comes to actually

271
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:07,470
paying for it everybody would do that

272
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:09,790
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit later on</font>

273
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:13,720
your vulnerabilities as i mentioned

274
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:15,730
released all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time the final point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

275
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,709
the product vendors the people who are

276
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:20,950
making these products there is no

277
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:23,619
incentive for them to make more secure

278
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:26,230
systems sure we'd like it sure to be

279
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:28,510
great the end of the day we live in

280
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:31,180
mostly capitalist world they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

281
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:34,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">make money and so if they're going to</font>

282
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:37,750
spend extra<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and extra production</font>

283
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:40,150
budget or development budget into their

00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:42,550
products<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> security there needs to</font>

285
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:44,290
be some incentive otherwise why would

286
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,790
they do it they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> interested in</font>

287
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:48,579
differentiating their products based on

288
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:51,699
functionality and cost at the moment

289
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:53,440
they can't necessarily differentiate

290
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:56,260
their product on security and that's in

291
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,670
development once it's released why would

292
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:00,310
they patch it they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> making device</font>

293
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:06,279
money they sell once they make their

294
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:09,699
money no incentive to patch so where is

295
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:10,990
it fixed already been around for a long

296
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,060
time we've talked about security

297
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:15,160
security is important<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so why don't</font>

298
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:18,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">we just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do pen testing code review on</font>

299
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:20,170
these systems well cost time issues once

00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:22,870
again<font color="#E5E5E5"> time budget costs</font>

301
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:25,089
I just personally don't think it's going

302
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:29,950
to work to the extent that we need to

<font color="#E5E5E5">why well it doesn't scale gartner</font>

that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of pen testers we already</font>

307
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:40,329
have issues at the moment where there's

308
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,010
not enough security people in the

309
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:43,930
industry to service the existing need

310
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:46,240
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pen test every product</font>

311
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:48,729
before it's released not only is a time

312
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,889
and cost issue there's an issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> around</font>

313
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:55,839
how many people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are going to be</font>

314
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:57,670
available to do that pen testing<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font>

need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to maintain these products over</font>

317
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:04,060
time doesn't address ongoing security

318
00:14:01,649 --> 00:14:06,519
security evaluations are inherently

319
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:09,670
subjective you're going to choose the

320

gold<font color="#E5E5E5"> dress pen tester or the blue desk</font>

322
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:17,019
start it's a subjective evaluation

323
00:14:14,829 --> 00:14:18,519
there's no floor my eyes methodology or

324
00:14:17,019 --> 00:14:21,339
at least if there is and there is in

325
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:24,970
some contexts it's not well maintained

326
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:26,769
and as somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who manages a number of</font>

327
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,839

organization let alone<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you're</font>

331
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:36,939

different things have different

334

incentives monetize things differently

335
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:48,579
finally the cost of this isn't exposed

336
00:14:45,699 --> 00:14:50,680
to the customer and the value of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> exposed to the customer so what I</font>

00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:55,899
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> by that let's say you go to into a</font>

339
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:58,540
store there's two televisions they have

this is the television you want there's

00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:14,949
two of them one<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs 500</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bucks one</font>

348
00:15:14,949 --> 00:15:17,979
additional information because there's

349
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:20,410
no information that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get from</font>

350
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:24,069
this in terms of security which one are

351
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:27,969
you going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to choose but what if one was</font>

352
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:31,449
more secure would you care how would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

353
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:33,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's more secure</font>

354
00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:34,779
and how much would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you care are you</font>

355
00:15:33,669 --> 00:15:36,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to care two hundred and fifty</font>

356
00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:38,739
dollars worth that's certainly going to

00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:42,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">be a point at which you're going to care</font>

358
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:46,169
less but security takes time and<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs</font>

359
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:48,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">money so that cost needs to be exposed</font>

360
00:15:46,169 --> 00:15:52,269
this means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I OT security in my</font>

361
00:15:48,939 --> 00:15:54,189
opinion is a commercial problem sure

362
00:15:52,269 --> 00:15:55,989
it's a technical problem but that

363
00:15:54,189 --> 00:15:58,929
technical problem is because<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are</font>

364
00:15:55,989 --> 00:16:01,720
no correct commercials wrapped around

365
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:04,299
the ability to externalize the

366
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,730
development costs and the ongoing<font color="#E5E5E5"> cost</font>

367
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:10,169
of security there is no incentive<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

368
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:12,669
vendors to maintain security over time

369
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:15,910
so what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the solution then how are we</font>

370
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:17,639
going to fix<font color="#E5E5E5"> this well commercial</font>

371
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:20,738
problems need to be addressed

372
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:23,290
commercially kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sense we need</font>

373
00:16:20,739 --> 00:16:25,660
to create an incentive for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the vendor to</font>

374
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:28,269
build security into their products we

375
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:30,639
need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to inform customers so</font>

376
00:16:28,269 --> 00:16:32,619
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a purchase decision so</font>

377
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,319
when a product costs more because it is

378
00:16:32,619 --> 00:16:37,569
more secure they can decide whether they

379
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:39,910
want more security at more cost or less

380
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:42,910
security and just take a little bit more

381
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:45,879
money home we need to also provide

382
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:49,059
methods for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the vendors to understand</font>

383
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:51,999
security now security is hard but of a

384
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:54,519
cliche but ultimately a lot of these

385
00:16:51,999 --> 00:16:57,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">people are very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good at making products</font>

386
00:16:54,519 --> 00:17:00,519
very good at adding features but they

387
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:02,439
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> always understand why or when that</font>

388
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:04,899
causes problems in security once again

389
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:07,209
work a lot with device vendors for the

390
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:09,279
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry even in that context</font>

391
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:12,010
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> always understand why</font>

392
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:13,299
something is more or less secure and so

393
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:15,908
if we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make products more</font>

394
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:17,949
secure we need to help educate the

395
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:21,189
vendors because otherwise it's not going

396
00:17:17,949 --> 00:17:23,559
to happen and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do all of this</font>

397
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:25,750
within<font color="#CCCCCC"> a framework</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that allows for rapid</font>

398
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:28,449
development because products need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:30,370
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> market on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their go to market date we</font>

400
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:34,179
need to do it in as little time and cost

401
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:37,779
as possible because things have budgets

402
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:40,990
and whereas little overhead as possible

403
00:17:37,779 --> 00:17:44,379
sounds easy well whenever I'm faced with

404
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:44,830
an insurmountable problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> I always refer</font>

405
00:17:44,379 --> 00:17:49,449

411
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:09,010
change consumer behavior in the past so

412
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:11,769
we've got star ratings for energy to

413

<font color="#E5E5E5">help change consumer behavior around</font>

00:18:19,269 --> 00:18:26,559
spend less money now and have a less

used around the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world this is the EU</font>

420
00:18:28,659 --> 00:18:34,260
rating for that sort of thing we also

421
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">have star ratings for water consumption</font>

422
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:40,240
now my personal anecdote around this is

423
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:42,760
I was purchasing a dishwasher at one

424
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,740
point we went in I saw the<font color="#E5E5E5"> one that was</font>

425
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:47,110
cheaper I said wow I really like this

426
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:49,389
one my wife saw the one that had five

427
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:52,149
water star rating said I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

428
00:18:49,389 --> 00:18:54,969
<font color="#CCCCCC">that one because she had been</font>

429
00:18:52,149 --> 00:18:57,309
incentivized around environmental issues

430
00:18:54,970 --> 00:18:59,529
and so forth to<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy something that had a</font>

431
00:18:57,309 --> 00:19:01,360
higher star rating when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you looked at it</font>

432
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:03,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">the difference wasn't actually that much</font>

433
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,529
the star rating though was changing the

434

have this for security well there are

438

problems how are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to compare</font>

439
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:23,889
devices in terms of evaluating their

440
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,408
security you could be comparing a router

441
00:19:23,889 --> 00:19:28,090
to a smart light bulb how we can do that

442
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:30,809
you could be looking at something that's

443

447
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,730
between systems objectively so that when

448
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,289
you have something that's running

00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:57,730
we going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that in a cost-effective</font>

453
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:58,690
way well let's keep it simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> I always</font>

456
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:07,960
as far as I'm concerned devices any

457
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:11,160
device any computing system can be

458
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:13,800
defined by three<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple things</font>

459
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,330

an output it's a brick that only has

462
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,560
inputs it's a heater they have to have

463
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:26,560
inputs and outputs to be a computing

465
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:31,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the code that makes the product do</font>

whatever it does everything has code in

467
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:35,679
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of my pet hates is when people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

468
00:20:33,490 --> 00:20:38,370
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware only systems everything</font>

469
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:41,110

470
00:20:38,370 --> 00:20:43,000
attack surface based on what it's

472
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,350
functions it has then you have the

473
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:50,020
system architecture what does it run on

474
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:52,510
is it Harvard architecture is it von

475
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:54,760
Neumann architecture does it have memory

476
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:57,010
protection is it all being run directly

477
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:58,720
out of ROM does it have relocatable

478
00:20:57,010 --> 00:21:01,090
memory these sorts of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

479
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,790
interesting when it comes to how a

device can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> attacked I'm going to call</font>

the combination<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those things the</font>

484
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:18,070
and the less secure system can be

00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:21,070
objectively considered the architecture

486
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:24,189
then can help make<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system more</font>

487
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:25,870
secure or less secure by<font color="#E5E5E5"> changing the</font>

490
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:34,690
vulnerabilities in the attack surface so

491
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:38,530
all we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do then once we've got</font>

492
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:40,750
these ways of assessing a system we need

to address the metrics we need to wrap

metrics well this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we can go</font>

497
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:50,730
back in history and we can figure out

what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> did they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just made them up a</font>

it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> people made up so you</font>

501
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:01,179
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> compare weights so we can make up</font>

502
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:05,410
metrics to enable us to compare the

503
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:08,560
security of systems so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to call</font>

504
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:10,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">this the logical security posture or LSP</font>

505
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:13,679
based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> point system</font>

506
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:16,050
and you have points assigned for

security features and you deduct points

508
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:23,490
for increasing attack surface incorrect

509
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:26,820
configurations poor architectures these

510
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:28,860
sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> things you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this because</font>

511
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:31,620
most computing vulnerabilities have

512
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:34,169
similar root causes like of randomness

513
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:35,820
big one happens all the time default

00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:37,920
configurations passwords cryptographic

515
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:40,980

00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:48,450
no logical protections these are the

519
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:51,449
sorts of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things I see in products all</font>

520
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:54,000
the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we can wrap some metrics</font>

521
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:59,640
around that so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at interfaces</font>

522
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:03,360
then every interface is doing you damage

523
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:06,840
each protocol supported increases the

524
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:10,260
attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> surface of the system and if you</font>

525
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,820
run that code or less a privilege you

526
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:13,950
can reduce the vulnerability surface

527
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:16,889
sure most people don't do that so you

528
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:20,550
can exploit the vulnerable code for a

529
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:23,220
meaningful<font color="#E5E5E5"> option so in LSB we assign</font>

530
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:24,870
negative points for all of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> logical</font>

531
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,280
interfaces that run at the same

<font color="#CCCCCC">privilege as the assets and the assets</font>

533
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:29,399

00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:32,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">be cryptographic keys it could be</font>

535
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:34,380
anything then you apply a multiplication

536
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,760
factor because it's more vulnerable

537
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,800
you're increasing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerability</font>

538
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,240
surface factors reducing the

539
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:41,940
vulnerability surface maybe it's being

540
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:45,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">run in a te these sorts of things add</font>

541
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:47,220
points or decrease<font color="#CCCCCC"> the multiplier now</font>

542
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:51,629
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> gives the vendor clear guidance</font>

543
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:54,240
that more interfaces is bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> now it</font>

544
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:56,100
sounds<font color="#CCCCCC"> obvious but it's just amazing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

545
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,660
vendors are trying to differentiate

546
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,000
their products based on features

547
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:01,950
features require more protocols more

548
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,240
code so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> you make it clear</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

549
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:05,100
vendors that that's a bad thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

550
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,260
security that could affect their sales

551
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:11,699
later on that helps the vendors make

552
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:14,670
sensible decisions so why do<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need yet</font>

553
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:18,570
another attack rating method we've

554
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:19,710
already got Jill which is a methodology

555
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:22,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's contained in common criteria</font>

556
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,110
we've got CBS s why don't we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

557
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:26,080
those

558
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:28,959
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're for actual vulnerabilities</font>

559
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:32,290
what I'm talking here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not costing a</font>

560
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,410
vulnerability it's a theoretical concept

561
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:36,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">about the obscurity of a system the</font>

562
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:38,920
system has a vulnerability should be

563
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:41,020
patched it should be fixed now that's

564
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:45,760
where pen testing and code review comes

565
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:47,860
in LSP helps to inform the vendors about

566
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:51,549
security as i mentioned provide clear

567
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:53,530
incentives and costings require if

568
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:55,750
you're going to use Jill if you're going

569
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:57,309
to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> cvss you need to do the pen</font>

570
00:24:55,750 --> 00:25:00,460
testing you need to do the code review

571
00:24:57,309 --> 00:25:02,260
that takes time costs money I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

572
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,150
that's going to work in IOT I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

573
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:06,480
see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> its scales I don't see how the</font>

574
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:10,080
vendors have enough time I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't see the</font>

00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:13,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">consumers being willing to pay for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

576
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:15,879
so look an example so we look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

577
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:18,010
linux-based systems basically the same

00:25:22,419 --> 00:25:27,520
features and functions greatly

581
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,260
simplified obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't have enough</font>

582
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,030
space on these slides<font color="#E5E5E5"> to include all</font>

583
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:32,860
features and functions but they do

584
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:35,559
certain things they've got various

585
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:40,178
interfaces and so forth so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we take a</font>

586
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:41,710
closer look at route it well okay we can

587
00:25:40,179 --> 00:25:43,299
start off saying there are

588
00:25:41,710 --> 00:25:45,250
vulnerabilities they're easy to fit see

589
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:47,530
it's got no linux kernel's got multiple

590
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:50,290
vulnerabilities it's got an old openssl

591
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:52,510
version got multiple vulnerabilities not

592
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:55,080
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very fair comparison so let's assume</font>

593
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:58,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they're fixed and now we have</font>

594
00:25:55,080 --> 00:26:01,059
exactly the same systems running exactly

595
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:06,100
the same code but it has different

596
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:07,660
vulnerabilities surface so external

597
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:10,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">interfaces</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> exposed at route that's</font>

598
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:14,850
problem that causes increased

599
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:19,739
vulnerability surface so minus points

600
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:23,409
default passwords problem minus points

601
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:25,330
default certs problem minus points and

602
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:27,900
they may not even necessarily be default

603
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:32,740
just generated the same each time and

604
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:34,559
because they don't have a a non stateful

605
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:37,470
random number

606
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:40,289
system so ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you start up</font>

607
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:42,539
that router system whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is you</font>

608
00:26:40,289 --> 00:26:44,059

609
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:47,549
generated at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time each time</font>

610
00:26:44,059 --> 00:26:49,649
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> did a scan essentially of the</font>

611
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:52,590
internet a number of years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and found</font>

612
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:54,658
that of all the systems that you could

613
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:56,939
access routers firewalls so forth on the

614
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:59,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet three</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> percent of them had the</font>

615
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:02,340
same certificates they weren't default

616
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:04,200
they were being generated randomly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

617
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:07,908
same way because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the random number</font>

618
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,909
generators weren't being used properly

619
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:14,789
non-secure interface exposed minus

620
00:27:11,789 --> 00:27:17,129
points you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the idea no commitment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

621
00:27:14,789 --> 00:27:20,309
updates an important part of this is you

622
00:27:17,129 --> 00:27:22,769
must patch because we have to assume

623
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:25,470
that new security vulnerabilities will

624
00:27:22,769 --> 00:27:27,990
come out so you absolutely<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to patch</font>

625
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:31,470
your system you have no commitment you

626
00:27:27,990 --> 00:27:32,899
do not get<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a good score so what</font>

627
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:36,149
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean what it would look like</font>

628
00:27:32,899 --> 00:27:38,719
ultimately no patching zero stars an

629
00:27:36,149 --> 00:27:41,369
automatic fail the other one not<font color="#E5E5E5"> too bad</font>

630
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,869
it's got some good features<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they're</font>

631
00:27:41,369 --> 00:27:44,369
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> things at different privilege</font>

632
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:48,449
levels using the right random number

633
00:27:44,369 --> 00:27:51,209
generator they have a unique password

634
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:53,039
and username that's on the sticker so

635
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:54,539
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> always turn it over but if you</font>

636
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:57,440
don't have physical access you don't

637
00:27:54,539 --> 00:28:00,509
know it these are good things and

638
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,669
importantly there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a date limit on it</font>

639
00:28:00,509 --> 00:28:05,669
because they have said that they would

640
00:28:02,669 --> 00:28:07,769
patch it for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain number of years</font>

641
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:11,159
certain period of time so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> star</font>

642
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:13,619
rating is fixed for that time it's not

643
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:15,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">forever it is only until it stops being</font>

644
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:20,009
patched at which point it is considered

645
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:22,950
insecure so is Rowdy more secure than

646
00:28:20,009 --> 00:28:25,669
routed well yes it has better

647
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:27,629
configurations it has better

648
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:29,999
implementations it has a smaller

649
00:28:27,629 --> 00:28:32,939
vulnerability surface even though they

650
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:36,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">both do the same thing does this mean</font>

651
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:40,320
reality is secure no it'll still need

652
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:42,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">patching and if they don't do that then</font>

653
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,519
they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lose their star points not</font>

654
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:46,139
only on this system<font color="#E5E5E5"> they need to lose it</font>

655
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:48,029
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future as well on other systems</font>

656
00:28:46,139 --> 00:28:49,498
they've demonstrated they're not

657
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:52,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting their commitments they lose</font>

658
00:28:49,499 --> 00:28:55,559
points and star rating into the future

659
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:57,928
so this mean that the less secure system

660
00:28:55,559 --> 00:29:02,759
routed will be exposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and vulnerable</font>

661
00:28:57,929 --> 00:29:04,169
first not<font color="#E5E5E5"> necessarily more secure</font>

662
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:06,419
doesn't necessarily mean doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> fail</font>

663
00:29:04,169 --> 00:29:08,519
what we're not saying here is the system

664
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:10,499
is secure we're not talking binary not

665
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:14,129
saying secure an insecure we're saying

666
00:29:10,499 --> 00:29:16,139
this configuration is better because

667
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:17,759
ultimately that's really the only thing

668
00:29:16,139 --> 00:29:20,399
we can do within the time cost

669
00:29:17,759 --> 00:29:22,710
constraints that we have that's why we

670
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:25,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">have patching them how do we ensure</font>

671
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:26,879
patching how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

672
00:29:25,379 --> 00:29:29,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">vendors are meeting their commitments</font>

673
00:29:26,879 --> 00:29:30,299
are patching their systems are doing

674
00:29:29,190 --> 00:29:32,339
what they say they do and now I've just

675
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:33,658
going al patch up for three years but

676
00:29:32,339 --> 00:29:36,299
then they ship it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and nothing ever</font>

677
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:40,279
happens well once again this has all

678
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:43,529
happened before and will<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again so</font>

679
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:46,499
I'm from an organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> called ul ul</font>

680
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:48,239
does a lot of electrical safety testing

681
00:29:46,499 --> 00:29:49,499
has done for a hundred years but it's

682
00:29:48,239 --> 00:29:51,479
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> unique in this lots of organizations</font>

683
00:29:49,499 --> 00:29:53,759
do this I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not here to talk about you</font>

684
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:56,839
well at all really but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font>

685
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:58,830
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this they had a similar problem</font>

686
00:29:56,839 --> 00:30:01,320
when they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at electrical</font>

687
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:02,908
safety how do<font color="#CCCCCC"> they know when you test</font>

688
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,950
the electrical safety of a speaker for

689
00:30:02,909 --> 00:30:06,659
example that they don't just ship you a

690
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:08,099
perfect speaker and then they

691
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:10,169
manufacture something in the factory

692
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:12,330
that is cheaper<font color="#CCCCCC"> but completely unsafe</font>

693
00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:16,469
there is a system<font color="#E5E5E5"> called a follow-up</font>

694
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:18,299
service every product that<font color="#E5E5E5"> has a ul mark</font>

695
00:30:16,469 --> 00:30:19,589
on it there are six billion products in

696
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:21,869
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world that have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you all marks on it</font>

697
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:24,749
every single<font color="#E5E5E5"> product that has that mark</font>

698
00:30:21,869 --> 00:30:26,999
somebody goes to the factory where that

699
00:30:24,749 --> 00:30:29,159
product is created every quarter and

700
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:33,059
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure it's still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being made the same</font>

701
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:36,960
way this already happens so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

702
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:39,239
that for security as well we can make

703
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:41,609
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when a vendor says I'm going</font>

704
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:43,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">to patch this somebody goes in and</font>

705
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:45,059
checks it they don't necessarily<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

706
00:30:43,619 --> 00:30:47,339
redo a pen test or<font color="#CCCCCC"> anything like that</font>

707
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:48,629
it's just go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say okay so I see</font>

708
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:50,219
you know you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular</font>

709
00:30:48,629 --> 00:30:52,289
Linux kernel version or something like

710
00:30:50,219 --> 00:30:54,719
that needs patching show me your latest

711
00:30:52,289 --> 00:30:58,259
patch they<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't done it they lose</font>

712
00:30:54,719 --> 00:31:00,630
their stars can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be done can be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

713
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:03,170
simply can be done cheaply fits in

714
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:06,600
time cost budget so if they don't do it

715
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:10,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">then they lose their points that's the</font>

716
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:15,240
important thing so ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> IOT</font>

717
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:18,060
security the problems are consumers

718
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,010
aren't security engineers they can't

719
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:21,899
differentiate products based on security

720
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:25,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">and to be honest with you even those of</font>

721
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:28,530
us who can still make decisions based on

722
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:30,540
features and functions and<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

723
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:32,070
example I assume we're all security

724
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:34,139
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this room and I don't want</font>

725
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:36,030
people put<font color="#CCCCCC"> up their hands but I equally</font>

726
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:39,090
assume a number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people in this</font>

727
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:41,010
audience have phones that are produced

728
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:43,169
by you know Android manufacturers

729
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:44,490
Samsung who are way I'm not going to

730
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:47,730
pick on a<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular manufacturer that</font>

731
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:49,290
aren't really patched because you've

732
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:51,720
made<font color="#E5E5E5"> a decision on the phone that you're</font>

733
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:54,450
buying based on cost and based on

734
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:56,280
features personally<font color="#E5E5E5"> I only use Nexus</font>

735
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:58,350
phones and big android fan but also<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

736
00:31:56,280 --> 00:32:00,510
big fan<font color="#E5E5E5"> of patching and I'll make sure</font>

737
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:03,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">the phone i have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is patched every month</font>

738
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:06,210
with security updates so even security

739
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:07,980
people don't necessarily make decisions

740
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:11,490
around security all the time features

741
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:15,090
functions cost is important security is

742
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:19,620
hard that is true<font color="#CCCCCC"> but because it's hard</font>

743
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:23,250
it is a costly and time-consuming and

744
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:27,060
ever and that is the problem it's not

745
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:29,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">that it's hard being hard is simply the</font>

746
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:31,889
thing that makes the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

747
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:35,040
problem is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't fit security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

748
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:37,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">easily into the development</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cost of a</font>

749
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:41,520
product commercial problems need

750
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:44,370
commercial solutions insurance is a

751
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:45,810
great market driver I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> insurance is</font>

752
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:47,790
going to be something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that changes</font>

753
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:49,830
things over time I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be very clear</font>

754
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:51,389
when I'm talking here actually that i'm

755
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:53,490
talking about consumer products to a

756
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:55,950
large extent i think when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

757
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:58,230
industrial products<font color="#E5E5E5"> health care products</font>

758
00:32:55,950 --> 00:33:01,470
they need to be tested<font color="#E5E5E5"> more thoroughly</font>

759
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:04,440
they have a better time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and cost budget</font>

760
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:07,020
in which to absorb the cost of security

761
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:09,060
I'm talking about consumer security but

762
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:11,129
I think insurance<font color="#E5E5E5"> can still play a part</font>

763
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:13,200
in this but they need metrics the

764
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:14,970
insurance industry needs to know that

765
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,649
not just throwing<font color="#E5E5E5"> money away when</font>

766
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:18,600
they're ensuring somebody so they need

767
00:33:16,649 --> 00:33:21,600
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to assess whether something</font>

768
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:24,360
secure or not now markets also don't

769
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,279
respond well to step functions what I

770
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:29,309
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> by that is if you say tomorrow</font>

771
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:33,000
every product ship must be secure it's

772
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:35,158
not going to happen it takes for example

773
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,919
the payment industry it's taken them

774
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:40,919
let's see about 15 years to change<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

775
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:42,269
Des does Triple DES and to be honest

776
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:45,630
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you some people still use single</font>

777
00:33:42,269 --> 00:33:48,269
des it takes a while to build security

778
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:51,389
into systems into products to educate

779
00:33:48,269 --> 00:33:54,590
people so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that we</font>

780
00:33:51,389 --> 00:33:59,189
have metrics to drive the commercial

781
00:33:54,590 --> 00:34:01,830
responsibility into the vendors and in

782
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:04,500
fact we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to encourage the vendors to</font>

783
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:06,990
build more secure systems and maintain

784
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:09,389
them over time<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would suggest if we're</font>

785
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:12,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to have a five-star rated system</font>

786
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:13,679
and some product has<font color="#CCCCCC"> five stars they</font>

787
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:15,899
need to have a bug bounty on that

788
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,030
product they need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be committed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

789
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:19,770
security of that product so that people

790
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:21,869
are actively looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> for vulnerabilities</font>

791
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:25,259
in it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're going to patch because</font>

792
00:34:21,869 --> 00:34:28,619
they've committed to patch so<font color="#E5E5E5"> ultimately</font>

793
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:30,780
IOT security personally I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

794
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:37,040
the stars not necessarily these days

795
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:37,040
though these does thank you very much

796
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:48,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so do we need to wait for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a large</font>

797
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:50,659
but I have to read them<font color="#E5E5E5"> out I think this</font>

798
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:55,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">whole silent question thing is really</font>

799
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:58,390
weird and<font color="#CCCCCC"> when do we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to wait for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

800
00:34:55,070 --> 00:35:01,820
large breach for companies pay attention

801
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:03,799
probably although i would go so further

802
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:07,150
is to say i<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think a large breach</font>

803
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:10,010
will be enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think there needs to be</font>

804
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:12,680
buy-in from governments and consumers on

805
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:15,170
this I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it'll take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time we're going</font>

806
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:18,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">to need something big yes my concern is</font>

807
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:21,440
we don't do something soon it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

808
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:22,670
be a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit too late so I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

809
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:33,650
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build it in now but yeah we</font>

810
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:35,990
probably need a bridge yeah I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know</font>

811
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:39,440
of any there might be some in the car

812
00:35:35,990 --> 00:35:42,169
industry but in terms<font color="#CCCCCC"> of consumer</font>

813
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,280
products I personally don't know of any

814
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:44,750
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know whether anybody in the</font>

815
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:54,740
audience does but I don't know of any

816
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:57,380
other baby monitors yes yep yeah and

817
00:35:54,740 --> 00:36:00,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> vtec as well which had some issues</font>

818
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,850
so yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay just good point</font>

819
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:17,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">I I think regulations are good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I I mean</font>

820
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:20,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">ultimately if anything's going to happen</font>

821
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:21,730
it needs to happen one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of two ways you</font>

822
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:23,950
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> need your legislator and you need</font>

823
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:25,510
some either an industry body to step in

824
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:27,370
and see these the rules it's probably

825
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:28,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">not going to happen or a government step</font>

826
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:31,810
in and say these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are rules which could</font>

827
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:33,250
happen or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to try and drive it</font>

828
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:34,600
commercially as I'm saying through

829
00:36:33,250 --> 00:36:36,160
something like star ratings and let

830
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:39,460
basically the commercial sort themselves

831
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:42,460
out I think there probably is a place

832
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:44,800
for regulation but<font color="#E5E5E5"> as I said the problem</font>

833
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:46,300
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you just regulate it today</font>

834
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,340
and said everything must be secure

835
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,020
tomorrow it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't work you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

836
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:51,790
can't do that the vendors don't know

837
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:53,350
what they're doing and there's not

838
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:56,140
enough people to test all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> products</font>

839
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:58,779
so yes I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we need regulation but</font>

840
00:36:56,140 --> 00:37:07,210
that needs to be built around<font color="#E5E5E5"> a testable</font>

841
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:08,260
framework<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay I violated my whole rule</font>

842
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:10,690
of reading it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to read</font>

843
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:11,800
out wood making vendors liable and legal

844
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:14,620
sense of security<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues and the</font>

845
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:17,800
products make a difference um it would

846
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:19,750
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> absolutely would I think we've seen a</font>

847
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:23,730
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the way companies take</font>

848
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:26,740
security seriously in terms of when

849
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:28,840
board members have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> held liable that</font>

850
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:30,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">really changes the way the company you</font>

851
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:34,210
know behaves to a large extent so I

852
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:37,210
think making vendors liable would but

853
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:39,910
the question is then liable for what I

854
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:41,380
mean what exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> are we going to make</font>

855
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:43,420
them liable for is it loss of

856
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:46,060
information is it just vulnerable ities

857
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:48,280
in their product some companies won't

858
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:50,950
care as much how do you make a vendor in

859
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:52,990
China liable for a fraud that happens in

860
00:37:50,950 --> 00:37:54,970
Australia I think there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

861
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:58,560
complexity around it would help but I'm

862
00:37:54,970 --> 00:37:58,560
not really<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure how you do it</font>

863
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:15,309
I I think yes is the answer I think they

864
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:17,529
would so I was at a meeting in where was

865
00:38:15,309 --> 00:38:22,989
it sweden at the start of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the year</font>

866
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:24,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking to a large vendor of consumer</font>

867
00:38:22,989 --> 00:38:27,269
products i won't mention any specific

868
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:30,910
names but they were very<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested in</font>

869
00:38:27,269 --> 00:38:33,069
having their devices tested for security

870
00:38:30,910 --> 00:38:35,170
in some way<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and they were very</font>

871
00:38:33,069 --> 00:38:36,400
interested in exposing that certainly<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

872
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:38,890
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do it it's going to put</font>

873
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,239
in the hard yards they<font color="#E5E5E5"> absolutely want</font>

874
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:42,460
to expose that they don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

875
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:44,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">something and then increase the cost of</font>

876
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:47,140
their product without being able to tell

877
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:50,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">everybody why it's costing more so I</font>

878
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:53,410
think there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely a an appetite</font>

879
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:55,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">for this in some areas and certainly</font>

880
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:57,999
there is not an appetite in other areas

881
00:38:55,479 --> 00:39:00,368
but I think once you have some companies

882
00:38:57,999 --> 00:39:03,279
doing it it will drive others to follow

883
00:39:00,369 --> 00:39:05,739
because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think consumers will choose an</font>

884
00:39:03,279 --> 00:39:07,989
i personally don't think it will confuse

885
00:39:05,739 --> 00:39:10,150
consumers if it's done right but maybe

886
00:39:07,989 --> 00:39:11,140
I'm just I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the average consumer so</font>

887
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:13,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">i don't know but i don't think it's</font>

888
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,529
confusing

889
00:39:21,329 --> 00:39:26,999
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think I've tried to build that</font>

890
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:29,789
into this system certainly in terms of

891
00:39:26,999 --> 00:39:32,160
patching however I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can at</font>

892
00:39:29,789 --> 00:39:34,890
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> make a go at assessing the</font>

893
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,049
security of the system I think just

894
00:39:34,890 --> 00:39:38,598
<font color="#CCCCCC">saying you know what I'm not even going</font>

895
00:39:37,049 --> 00:39:44,009
to look at it you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to patch is</font>

896
00:39:38,599 --> 00:39:46,619
fine but it's very reactive I think you

897
00:39:44,009 --> 00:39:49,200
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be reactive but I think also we</font>

898
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:51,150
need to have methodologies to assess

899
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,968
them and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can be done I think</font>

900
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:55,680
it can be done so I agree yes she'll be

901
00:39:53,969 --> 00:39:57,749
patched should be all these sorts of

902
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,399
things but I think we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> build the</font>

903
00:39:57,749 --> 00:40:03,118
methodology in for assessment at the

904
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:05,359
same time and apparently that's it thank

905
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:05,359
you very much
