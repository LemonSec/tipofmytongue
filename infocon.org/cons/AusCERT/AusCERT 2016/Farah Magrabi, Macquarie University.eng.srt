11
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,600
it's lovely to be here and to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:42,718
giving<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk today and I thank the</font>

13
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,489
organizers I'm for inviting me so as the

14
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,010
title suggests we're going to talk about

15
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:50,070
cyber risks and health and we'll do this

16
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:51,269
in three parts and the first part<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I</font>

17
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,820
want to do is to just<font color="#E5E5E5"> lay some</font>

18
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,739
fundamentals look at you know how

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">information technology is used in</font>

20
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:01,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">healthcare and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then also add some trends</font>

21
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,629
in terms of where arm it's going will

22
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,439
then look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> consequences of cyber</font>

23
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:09,360
risks and the final part<font color="#CCCCCC"> will look at</font>

24
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,039
the socio technical considerations so

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,110
what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the important and</font>

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,900
things or how do you get security to

27
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,820
work in health and what I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do</font>

28
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,890
is to share with you some of my

29
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,839
experiences of working in patient safety

30
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,110
because all of the things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

31
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,110
talking about insecurity they also have

32
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:31,170
kind of parallels in terms of how do you

33
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:33,210
make IT systems safe in<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare and</font>

34
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to draw upon a lot of my</font>

35
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,880
experiences<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm in patient safety to</font>

36
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,340
kind of address the security question so

37
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,380
let's get going<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm so in a very very</font>

38
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of fundamental sense digital health</font>

39
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:49,408
can improve care delivery and patient

40
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,810
safety<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're seeing that you know IT</font>

41
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:54,329
systems are revolutionising healthcare

42
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:57,030
IT is also becoming a key enabler for

43
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:59,309
patients and to actively participate in

44
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:02,969
their care processes indeed<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure</font>

45
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:05,219
there's many you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> T savvy folks in</font>

46
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:07,259
this audience who you know are tracking

47
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,970
every activity accessing their health

48
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:11,430
information communicating with their

49
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,240
providers be interesting to kind of find

50
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,260
out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

51
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:18,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">or as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we go through IT has many many</font>

52
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,690
benefits in<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare but just like any</font>

53
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:26,340
other sector we are susceptible to these

54
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:28,410
risks of cyber threats so where the use

55
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,780
of this of digital technologies

56
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:35,070
basically makes us vulnerable to<font color="#CCCCCC"> cyber</font>

57
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:36,420
threats what is how<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> t used foreign</font>

58
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:38,190
health and this is really important to

59
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:41,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">understand as we try to address the</font>

60
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:43,859
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> question so what information is</font>

61
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:45,600
really being used for in health is it's

62
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,160
being used to make decisions we're

63
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,829
making decisions every day or about

64
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,740
diagnosis about treating patients about

65
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,990
prescribing about retrieving health

66
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:57,140
information providing you know

67
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:59,310
clinicians with alerts and reminders

68
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,829
health information needs to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

69
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:04,110
communicated so across the board we're

70
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:07,500
looking at everything from email to

71
00:03:04,110 --> 00:03:10,880
really specific communication like the

72
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:14,490
ordering of pathology tests referrals um

73
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:16,590
so I mean I'm sure everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> has visited</font>

74
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:19,470
a GP in this audience and then gone off

75
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:22,200
with a letter to you know go see a

76
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:25,170
specialist or go see you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> any other</font>

77
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,850
health care provider and now with

78
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,040
electronic systems all of those

79
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:34,829
referrals will increasingly happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

80
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:36,810
online<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so that was messaging and</font>

81
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,850
then what we need to keep records so you

82
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:40,590
know we're moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> from keeping records</font>

83
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:44,820
on paper to maintaining them

84
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:47,130
electronically enlisted of doing that

85
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:50,220
right across the board so from GPS and

86
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:51,630
primary care<font color="#E5E5E5"> clinics to hospitals and as</font>

87
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,760
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned to you increasingly</font>

88
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,140
consumers are being more engaged in

89
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,690
their health and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> in maintaining</font>

90
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:00,019
their own health information and we'll

91
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:03,510
come<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to that in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about two slides</font>

92
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:05,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">Health processes are being automated so</font>

93
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,310
the example here is pathology testing

94
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,410
you know that there are many tasks in

95
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,660
this process<font color="#CCCCCC"> our test needs to be</font>

96
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:16,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">ordered the special specimen needs to be</font>

97
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:18,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">collected the results need to be made</font>

98
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:20,640
available so that once the specimen is

99
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,290
processed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then the results need to</font>

100
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,530
be you know sent back to the doctor and

101
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:28,220
made available so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> get read in a tie</font>

102
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:30,380
Lamela all of these tasks<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you</font>

103
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,300
digitize all your<font color="#E5E5E5"> automated health care</font>

104
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:36,710
process are then being supported by IT

105
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:38,600
systems similarly<font color="#CCCCCC"> for other processes</font>

106
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,580
such as medications and you know you

107
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:42,230
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the prescribing of the medications</font>

108
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,960
the medication then needs to be checked

109
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:47,870
and dispensed and then given to the

110
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:50,330
patient so what we're finding is

111
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:52,310
increasingly IT systems as supporting

112
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:55,130
important clinical processes in

113
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:57,169
hospitals and in general practice and

114
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:59,690
what we would say is that they are now

115
00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:01,280
playing a mission critical role so it's

116
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:03,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the end of the day</font>

117
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:07,669
you're using IT systems to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bill patients</font>

118
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:09,530
or you know to maintain order you know

119
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:10,969
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you might need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep the</font>

120
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:14,659
hospital up and running but you're

121
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:17,390
actually using IT systems 24-7 to

122
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,729
support the delivery of care and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

123
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:21,880
why as you'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> and when we go through</font>

124
00:05:19,729 --> 00:05:24,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">this presentation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's critical or</font>

125
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:30,650
it's actually significant when these IT

126
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:32,900
systems are taken down by a hack the

127
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:34,609
information for many of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> processes</font>

128
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:37,010
is also provided<font color="#CCCCCC"> by medical devices</font>

129
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:39,590
which are increasingly being networked

130
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:41,539
so in the old<font color="#E5E5E5"> days you'd have you know</font>

131
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:43,969
the ECG being acquired and then that

132
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:45,650
information manually been put into an

133
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:50,210
electronic<font color="#E5E5E5"> system but increasingly</font>

134
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:52,849
medical devices are networked and that

135
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:54,830
again increases another<font color="#E5E5E5"> potential you</font>

137
00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:00,800
system overall trends in Australia so

138
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm pretty well overall I'm</font>

139
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,870
ninety-seven percent of our GPS use

140
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,159
electronic records in hospitals and I

141
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:09,169
have the numbers here from New South

142
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,570
Wales and I'm pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure it's similar</font>

143
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:13,880
up here in Queensland<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're in twenty</font>

144
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,320
fourteen eighty percent of New South

145
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,940
Wales or the care delivery to eighty

146
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:19,969
percent of patients were supported by

147
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:22,490
electronic records nationally we have

148
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:25,550
the my health record system which has

149
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:27,620
about 2.7 million<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm consumers enrolled</font>

150
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:31,130
at the moment and that's only going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

151
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:34,460
increase the system has moved from an

152
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:36,229
opt-in to an opt-out model so if the

153
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,489
current trials are successful then it'll

154
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,800
move to an or

155
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:43,009
model so many more people being enrolled

156
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:45,080
so that's kind of you know conserve

157
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:47,060
we're seeing consumers are being more

158
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:50,000
more engaged with their health so here

159
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,130
is a patient<font color="#E5E5E5"> portal it's basically the</font>

160
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,810
patient facing information system that

161
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:55,520
is being provided by a hospital and I

162
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:57,500
had to pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. example because it's</font>

163
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,900
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> many in Australia yet but we're</font>

164
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:02,509
sort of moving in that direction what

165
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,130
these systems allow patients to do is

166
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:06,080
they allow them to view their own

167
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:08,360
records to look at their test results to

168
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,280
look at their current medications to

169
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,860
keep notes to communicate with providers

170
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:15,770
and also keep an eye on the records of

171
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:19,819
their family or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people that they</font>

172
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:21,409
care for we're tracking our activity a

173
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:23,300
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more so how many people in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

174
00:07:21,409 --> 00:07:27,380
audience are tracking their activity

175
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:29,990
fitbit's<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go a few probably many</font>

176
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:32,180
more than who willing to admit and then

177
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:36,590
we sharing all of that information in

178
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:40,250
social<font color="#CCCCCC"> media as well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so at that point</font>

179
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:42,500
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to sort</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of do is um just</font>

180
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:44,870
kind of pause for a second and what I've

181
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,759
tried<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show you in this first part is</font>

182
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,430
to show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that health information is</font>

183
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:52,310
distributed and the power of health

184
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:54,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">information then really comes from you</font>

185
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,800
know making that information available

186
00:07:54,889 --> 00:08:00,770
or making that information which is

187
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">distributed across</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over many sources and</font>

188
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:06,710
what we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is to join the dots</font>

189
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:09,169
from a variety of sources and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the</font>

190
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:10,940
effective coordination of care then

191
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:13,190
relies and communication of that

192
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,599
information and that's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

193
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:16,430
information it's confidential

194
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:18,110
information it's your confidential

195
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:19,969
information it's my confidential

196
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:23,750
information and so we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

197
00:08:19,969 --> 00:08:25,340
treating that very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very seriously if we</font>

198
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,259
take the example of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very common</font>

199
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,310
disease such as diabetes I mean most<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

200
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:29,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">people in this audience are probably</font>

201
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:33,099
young and healthy but if you know how to

202
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:35,270
pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> an example that where you have a</font>

203
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:37,339
multiple number of people caring for a

204
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:42,228
patient so diabetes is a very common

205
00:08:37,339 --> 00:08:44,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">disease you can see that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there there can</font>

206
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:46,880
be many players are there many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

207
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:49,850
that team so you have a GP a specialist

208
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,920
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dietitian indeed a</font>

209
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:54,079
portion of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> information is sitting</font>

210
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the patient in terms of what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

211
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:59,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">are eating and how active they are being</font>

212
00:08:55,730 --> 00:09:01,100
to manage<font color="#CCCCCC"> that disease and in a sense</font>

213
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,660
there's no point<font color="#E5E5E5"> in having all of this</font>

214
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,990
information if you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lock it</font>

215
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:07,430
down so what we know are very

216
00:09:04,990 --> 00:09:09,740
fundamental so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> principle is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

217
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:11,689
there is a tension<font color="#CCCCCC"> between you know</font>

218
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:15,079
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to health information and</font>

219
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:16,730
security because having information and

220
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:20,420
health is all about making<font color="#E5E5E5"> it accessible</font>

221
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:23,389
making it available to<font color="#E5E5E5"> clinicians at the</font>

222
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:25,399
point of<font color="#CCCCCC"> care and to allow them to join</font>

223
00:09:23,389 --> 00:09:27,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">the dots from a variety of sources and</font>

224
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:30,110
that's a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> tough</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing when it</font>

225
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:33,620
comes to security as this audience will

226
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:36,350
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of appreciate and where is it going</font>

227
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:38,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here is a slide of the digital health</font>

228
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:39,350
revolution am<font color="#E5E5E5"> sir is looking for a</font>

229
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">picture that would capture everything</font>

230
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:43,759
and this kind of does it it's not great

231
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:45,829
resolution but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and talk you</font>

232
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:48,889
through it so what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing now is</font>

233
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:51,258
with the digitization of<font color="#E5E5E5"> health</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> care</font>

234
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:53,290
we're combining digital the digital

235
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:56,720
revolution with the genomic revolution

236
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:58,819
and what this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is doing is it's providing</font>

237
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,680
much much more data than that there was

238
00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:02,509
ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> available and we're getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it from</font>

239
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:05,000
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> many different sources so right</font>

240
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:07,250
across the board we're looking from you

241
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,680
know wireless sensors and devices to

242
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:13,189
mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> devices social networking</font>

243
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,870
genomics the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet imaging data and</font>

244
00:10:13,189 --> 00:10:17,500
then health information systems<font color="#CCCCCC"> which is</font>

245
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:20,269
what I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been talking about mostly</font>

246
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:23,149
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving from you know treating</font>

247
00:10:20,269 --> 00:10:26,800
diseases of to actually prevention so

248
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:29,269
we're moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> to from you know general</font>

249
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:32,959
treatments to tailoring treatment to

250
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:35,509
individual patients and you can't Taylor

251
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,489
a treatment to an individual unless you

252
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:38,870
have all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their information and then</font>

253
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:41,029
that's processed in a correct manner

254
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:42,860
because you're really relying on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

255
00:10:41,029 --> 00:10:45,709
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make the right decisions</font>

256
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:48,199
and we so last year the US President

257
00:10:45,709 --> 00:10:50,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">Obama announced the precision</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> medicine</font>

258
00:10:48,199 --> 00:10:52,130
initiative and which is essentially what

259
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is to bring</font>

260
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:56,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">together information from a variety of</font>

261
00:10:53,930 --> 00:11:00,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">sources many many many more sources than</font>

262
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:02,540
we can ever think of to tailor

263
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,560
treatments to individuals and that's

264
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:05,689
pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much where</font>

265
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:08,810
heading<font color="#E5E5E5"> in health the only going to</font>

266
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:10,700
increase the amount of data so big data

267
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:12,439
is you know a cliche word but in health

268
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,970
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> amount of data that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have or the</font>

269
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,190
amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information that is going to</font>

270
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:19,970
be made available about patients is

271
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:21,980
going to increase and we're looking

272
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:24,200
right from birth to that it's not

273
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:26,900
episodic care but really caring for

274
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:30,220
people on an everyday basis and then

275
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:33,380
consumers increasingly being more active

276
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:35,270
participants in their in<font color="#CCCCCC"> their health so</font>

277
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:38,450
then they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be accessing all of</font>

278
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:40,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> data as well against that</font>

279
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:42,080
background we see the cyber risks in

280
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:44,569
health are on the rise if you've even

281
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:47,570
been sort of without<font color="#E5E5E5"> even really paying</font>

282
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:49,670
you know a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of attention if you've</font>

283
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:51,050
been following you know the news the

284
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:53,949
last couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of months so ever since I</font>

285
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:55,880
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> invited I've been sort of on an</font>

286
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:58,640
keeping an eye out for<font color="#CCCCCC"> cybersecurity</font>

287
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,050
stories and most of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> tend to come</font>

288
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:02,270
from health it's very sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

289
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:04,130
interesting so in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. hacking</font>

290
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:08,000
healthcare records has reached epidemic

291
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:09,470
proportions in 2016 so in 2016 alone 3.5

292
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,440
million patient records had been

293
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:16,300
compromised you're looking at about on

294
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:18,860
an average for data breaches per week a

295
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,870
survey of us healthcare organizations

296
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,720
reported that so eighty-nine percent of

297
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:27,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations reported one or more data</font>

298

300
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:36,890
estimated to be about 75 billion and

301
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:38,780
expected to reach 170 billion in 2020 so

302
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:44,060
you know you guys are in the right

303
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:45,620

308
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:56,540
address this important security question

309
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:59,000
so at a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> basic level just like any</font>

310
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:01,310
other sector privacy breaches common but

311
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,839
what's different<font color="#CCCCCC"> in health organizations</font>

312
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:05,900
and what makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> them particularly</font>

313
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,970
susceptible is the volume as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the</font>

collect the<font color="#CCCCCC"> scale of data breaches is</font>

316
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:17,000
particularly notable so the anthem to

317
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,699
just go back a second day in 2015

318
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:21,890
you had about one in three Americans who

319
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:24,050
were victims of the health data being

320
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:26,420
breached one and three that's pretty

321
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:28,640
significant I would say and these<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

322
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,260
attributed to a series of large-scale

323
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,030
attacks so this was not like<font color="#CCCCCC"> one or two</font>

324
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:34,810
people's records being breached but

325
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:38,510
large-scale attacks that each affected

326
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:40,520
more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 million individuals the</font>

attack on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the insurance provider anthem</font>

00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:45,860

329
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,260
records of 79 million people's there's a

<font color="#E5E5E5">single attack 79 million records being</font>

332
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,300
all gets reported in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so the US</font>

333
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:59,449
Department of Health and Human Services

334
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:02,150
requires the reporting of data breaches

335
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:04,370
affecting 500 or more individuals and

336
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:06,199
they started tracking this back in 2009

337
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:08,360
so the horizontal axis<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the years and</font>

338
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">the vertical axis</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is individual records</font>

339
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:14,510
being affected millions of<font color="#E5E5E5"> records in</font>

340
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:16,430
this case and in 2015 it was 113 million

341
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:20,710
and so its<font color="#E5E5E5"> interests it'll be</font>

342
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:20,709
interesting to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see what it is for 2016</font>

343
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:26,300
turns out you know identity theft and

344
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:30,110
fraud is common so as with most other

345
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:32,810
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> information that is hacked but</font>

346
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:34,730
your medical record is worth much much

347
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:36,829
more to hackers than even your credit

348
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:47,960
card records anyone want to have a guess

349
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:50,480
at how much<font color="#E5E5E5"> more too much lower 10 it's</font>

350
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:52,010
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 times more than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your credit</font>

351
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:54,350
card information and there's a huge

352
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:56,990
underground market for stolen patient

353
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:59,750
data what hackers or what fraudsters

354
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:03,080
tend to do is they<font color="#E5E5E5"> tend to use this fake</font>

355
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:05,150
identity information to then biomedical

356
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:09,740
equipment or buy drugs and then sell

357
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:11,270
them the other way<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to combine patient</font>

358
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,980
information with provider information

359
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:15,350
and this has actually happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

360
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,330
Australia as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the records of</font>

361
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:19,490
some patients attending a general

362
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:21,560
practice were hacked and then that was

363
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,750
combined<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the practice information</font>

364
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,540
to commit a Medicare fraud so basically

365
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:28,970
send lots of claims to medicare but the

366
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:30,050
claims are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being routed to the hackers</font>

367
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:33,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">route not the</font>

368
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:36,529
actors and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was no medical service</font>

369
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:39,800
being provided one of the problems<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

370
00:15:36,529 --> 00:15:42,230
that these these kind of breaches take

371
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,839
much longer to detect compared to a

372
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:47,480
credit<font color="#E5E5E5"> card so once a credit card um is</font>

373
00:15:44,839 --> 00:15:48,920
that a fraud is detected or as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

374
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,500
you lose the credit card you ring the

375
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:53,390
bank and cancel it but when a medical

376
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,399
identity theft happens it takes much

377
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:57,649
longer to detect it's only you know a

378
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:59,390
few<font color="#CCCCCC"> months</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> later when a patient receives</font>

379
00:15:57,649 --> 00:16:01,579
a huge bill and this is the case in the

380
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:04,279
US where you know patients are suddenly

381
00:16:01,579 --> 00:16:06,769
receiving huge bills for services and

382
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:08,180
surgeries they've never had and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

383
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:09,620
you're thinking all where's this coming

384
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,540
from and then so they've gone to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

385
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:13,370
and that's where they<font color="#CCCCCC"> found that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

386
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:16,519
identities of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> patients were stolen</font>

387
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:19,550
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then being used to make false claims</font>

388
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:21,279
for payments we're seeing similar trends

389
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:24,290
and consumer technologies as well

390
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,990
earlier this year the online accounts of

391
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:29,000
Fitbit users were hacked by fraudsters

392
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:31,040
who change their user names and<font color="#E5E5E5"> email</font>

393
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:36,529
addresses they then use that information

394
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:39,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">to order replacement parts under the</font>

395
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:41,600
that uses warranty and they also got

396
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:43,310
access to the users GPS history so

397
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,839
basically their activity levels when

398
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,579
they were sleeping when they were waking

399
00:16:44,839 --> 00:16:50,480
you know and that could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used to</font>

400
00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:52,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">commit other crimes ransomware has</font>

401
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,350
emerged as a major threat in the last

402
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:56,060
couple of years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> these attacks have</font>

403
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,800
targeted all kinds of<font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare</font>

404
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:59,869
organizations so from a small general

405
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:02,390
practice to large hospital networks and

406
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:05,089
I'm going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you a few examples so</font>

407
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:09,470
one such attacker could right here on

408
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:12,369
the Gold Coast in Queensland in 2012 so

409
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:16,370
what these hackers did was they used the

410
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:18,829
windows remote desktop connection to get

411
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:20,448
into the practice records encrypt all of

412
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:24,980
the data files and basically lock it

413
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:27,650
down and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> demanded a ransom of about</font>

414
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:29,510
four thousand dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> um so the good</font>

415
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:31,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this practice had been</font>

416
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:34,460
backing up all of their<font color="#CCCCCC"> data they didn't</font>

417
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,559
have an image<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the system so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as soon</font>

418
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:38,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">as it was detected it was detected</font>

419
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">because they try to login and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then it</font>

420
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:41,630
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a message</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from the hackers</font>

421
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,929
basically saying your data is lock up

422
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:46,299
locked up so pay up

423
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:49,149
and unless you pay up we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will unlock it</font>

424
00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:51,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">and so because they had a full data</font>

425
00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:52,719
backup they were able to restore it<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

426
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,330
it took a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of days so meanwhile</font>

427
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:58,480
the practice staff had reverted to paper

428
00:17:55,330 --> 00:18:01,629
records to make appointments and to also

429
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:04,119
keep patient records earlier this year

430
00:18:01,629 --> 00:18:05,080
the hospital a hospital<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> US said</font>

431
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:07,899
this was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Hollywood Presbyterian</font>

432
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:09,460

<font color="#CCCCCC">their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> email and the electronic health</font>

434
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:14,590

435
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,850
for more than a week and if you think

systems down so email and electronic

around 30,000 people treats thousands of

454
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:08,139
days clinicians had to resort to using

communicate it<font color="#E5E5E5"> took about a week to</font>

458
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:17,080
restore systems because what they

459
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:20,379
basically did<font color="#E5E5E5"> is they took everything</font>

460
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,428
down and then maybe restored it from the

461
00:19:20,379 --> 00:19:23,740
back up so they weren't willing to

462
00:19:21,429 --> 00:19:26,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">publicly discuss the nature of the</font>

464
00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:30,309
up and running because they didn't want

465
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:32,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give publicity to the hackers but no</font>

466
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:35,830
ransom was paid although<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

467
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:38,199
demand for a huge ransom the los angeles

468
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:39,730
hospital in contrast ended up paying a

469
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,240
ransom of about seventeen thousand

470
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:45,460
dollars in bitcoins<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as this audience</font>

471
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,230
is familiar and that is much much harder

472
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:50,789
to track so increasingly the use of

473
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:54,759
bitcoins makes it you know more<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess</font>

474
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:56,590
easy and to get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> payment</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so much more</font>

475
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:58,659
easy to target

476
00:19:56,590 --> 00:20:01,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">healthcare and other organizations as</font>

477
00:19:58,659 --> 00:20:04,390
well turns out that you know hackers can

478
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:06,340
have other motivations as well so health

479
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:07,960
organizations can be targeted<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

480
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,939
politically or socially motivated

481
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:12,220
purpose so this was a very first

482
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:14,169
instance of hacktivism where a

483
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,570
healthcare organization was targeted

484
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:21,429
this was the Boston Children's Hospital

485
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:23,678
back in 2014 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the hakkens did in</font>

486
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:25,870
this case so there was a child custody

487
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:30,340
case it was a highly publicized child

488
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:33,129
custody case that and the child had been

489
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:34,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">treated at this hospital and so what the</font>

490
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:36,610
hackers did is they directed a

491
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:38,949
distributed denial-of-service attack

492
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:41,289
against this<font color="#CCCCCC"> hospital's external website</font>

493
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:44,799
so not the internal systems but the

494
00:20:41,289 --> 00:20:46,658
external website in addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> they made</font>

495
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:49,480
multiple attempts to penetrate the

496
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:51,549
hospital's Network<font color="#E5E5E5"> why exposed ports and</font>

497
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:55,330
services as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well they send a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

498
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:58,179
spear phishing emails to again get into

00:20:55,330 --> 00:20:59,529
the network<font color="#CCCCCC"> and rather than</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making you</font>

500
00:20:58,179 --> 00:21:01,270
know the clinical applications

501
00:20:59,529 --> 00:21:03,789
completely available because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

502
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:06,668
traffic was just being flooded it

503
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:08,230
rendered certain applications or certain

504
00:21:06,669 --> 00:21:10,480
functionalities of applications

505
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:13,240
unavailable for instance clinicians

506
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:14,740
could prescribe or<font color="#CCCCCC"> make right up</font>

507
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:17,260
prescriptions and print them but they

508
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:21,010
couldn't send them to the pharmacy the

509
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:22,750
email so again to kind of restore

510
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:25,059
systems they had to shut the email down

511
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:29,590
find the malicious email and then notify

512
00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:31,809
staff not to click on any email they had

513
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:34,000
to develop workarounds for any processes

514
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:38,830
or internal processes that relied on the

515
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:41,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">network for communication and the irony</font>

516
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">was when this attack happened the child</font>

517
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:44,649
wasn't it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't even at the hospital</font>

518
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,979
their child had already left the

519
00:21:44,649 --> 00:21:51,158
hospital so here's a graph of the actual

520
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:53,230
attack so you can see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bloob it</font>

521
00:21:51,159 --> 00:21:57,870
is legitimate traffic and then the red

522
00:21:53,230 --> 00:22:00,850
bit is act as the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of attack</font>

523
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:02,799
progressed it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the hospital</font>

524
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:04,870
worked with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dis fence vendor to</font>

525
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:09,789
redirect traffic so this was all of the

526
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:10,508
malicious traffic in red so long side

527
00:22:09,789 --> 00:22:12,940
disruptions

528
00:22:10,509 --> 00:22:14,829
k deliveries we there's also the

529
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:17,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">potential to directly harm patients</font>

530
00:22:14,829 --> 00:22:20,229
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't been any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reports um</font>

531
00:22:17,729 --> 00:22:21,969
thankfully but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the potential for such</font>

532
00:22:20,229 --> 00:22:25,329
attacks has been demonstrated<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

533
00:22:21,969 --> 00:22:26,529
research exercises and maybe some<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

534
00:22:25,329 --> 00:22:28,178
in the audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> are already familiar</font>

535
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:30,729
with these because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they've happened at</font>

536
00:22:28,179 --> 00:22:32,729
conferences like this so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was in a</font>

537
00:22:30,729 --> 00:22:34,869
security researcher who basically

538
00:22:32,729 --> 00:22:38,709
demonstrated that he<font color="#E5E5E5"> could scan the</font>

539
00:22:34,869 --> 00:22:41,228
network for insulin pumps that had a

540
00:22:38,709 --> 00:22:42,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">wireless connection and then he could</font>

541
00:22:41,229 --> 00:22:45,849
program them from his<font color="#CCCCCC"> laptop to</font>

542
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:50,979
basically dumped<font color="#E5E5E5"> the contents of the of</font>

543
00:22:45,849 --> 00:22:54,849
the whole device so basically overdose

544
00:22:50,979 --> 00:22:56,829
the patient without even being without

545
00:22:54,849 --> 00:22:59,259
any need for even the identification

546
00:22:56,829 --> 00:23:02,349
numbers at a different conference the

547
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:04,029
same researchers showed that he could

548
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:05,559
reverse-engineer a pacemaker to

549
00:23:04,029 --> 00:23:08,679
basically deliver a high-voltage shock

550
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:13,209
from about 50 feet away so medical

551
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:15,609
devices there's a high risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> again there</font>

552
00:23:13,209 --> 00:23:18,269
when medical devices are networked and

553
00:23:15,609 --> 00:23:21,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of the big problems is that these</font>

554
00:23:18,269 --> 00:23:23,529
types of attacks can go undetected so

555
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:26,408
once it's happened and nobody suspects

556
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:28,149
that it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be an attack</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like this and</font>

557
00:23:26,409 --> 00:23:33,459
the other problem is<font color="#E5E5E5"> also in</font>

558
00:23:28,149 --> 00:23:35,589
investigating you know such events so

559
00:23:33,459 --> 00:23:36,759
the other if anyone's interested I'd

560
00:23:35,589 --> 00:23:38,319
encourage you to go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at this</font>

561
00:23:36,759 --> 00:23:40,359
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk about so this</font>

562
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,309
was a research done by independent

563
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:44,049
security evaluators<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they looked at a</font>

564
00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:46,928
number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> health</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> care facilities and</font>

565
00:23:44,049 --> 00:23:48,879
data facilities medical devices as well

566
00:23:46,929 --> 00:23:50,709
as web applications so across the board

567
00:23:48,879 --> 00:23:52,329
and healthy look at a number they looked

568
00:23:50,709 --> 00:23:54,639
at all of the possible ways in which

569
00:23:52,329 --> 00:23:57,698
<font color="#E5E5E5">healthcare information systems and</font>

570
00:23:54,639 --> 00:24:00,758
devices could be hacked and the premise

571
00:23:57,699 --> 00:24:03,699
of their sort of framework that they

572
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:06,339
have developed is basically that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

573
00:24:03,699 --> 00:24:10,149
information is wrong missing delayed or

574
00:24:06,339 --> 00:24:13,119
incomplete it can harm patients and so

575
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:18,218
any cyber attack which which you know

576
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:24,330
has a potential to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> information or</font>

577
00:24:18,219 --> 00:24:27,520
to has a potential to to you know

578
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:29,889
so lost my words here any sort of cyber

579
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,600
attack which has a potential<font color="#CCCCCC"> to corrupt</font>

580
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:35,950
the information or patient information

581
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:38,409
then can potentially harm patients so

582
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:40,600
that was patient harm and those are kind

583
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,980
of the main sort of consequences that I

584
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:45,159
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of just highlight to you</font>

585
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:47,200
today so how do we kind of solve this

586
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,610
problem so you guys are the experts and

587
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,530
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i thought i would was worth</font>

588
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:53,740
discussing today with some of the you

589
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:55,780
know socio technical considerations for

590
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:57,340
securing health information and by<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

591
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:59,110
you know it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people it's</font>

592
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,090
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the terror and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the processes</font>

593
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:02,919
within which they work and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

594
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:04,570
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> also understand you know what are</font>

595
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,010
the types of technologies and that's

596
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:08,649
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about in the next couple</font>

597
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:11,200
slides so when we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

598
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:12,580
you've seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> um you know through this</font>

599
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,620
talk that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are multiple</font>

600
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:16,899
stakeholders for health information and

601
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:18,969
they distributed in time as well as

602
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,650
space so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hard to define who</font>

603
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:23,230
needs access to this information it

604
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:25,720
really depends on<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you progress</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

605
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:27,430
health what you fall ill with what are

606
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,380
the side effects and who else needs to

607
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:31,780
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the team and how long that episode</font>

608
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:34,660
of treatment lasts so there's multiple

609
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:36,639
stakeholders in space and time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go</font>

610
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:38,530
right from patients<font color="#E5E5E5"> and carers to</font>

611
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">healthcare workers social workers who</font>

612
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:43,899
need access to health information the

613
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:45,550
needs of these users are diverse as well

614
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:47,440
as their task<font color="#E5E5E5"> requirement so clinicians</font>

615
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:49,210
their motivation is to treat patients

616
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,640
and you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make that information</font>

617
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:54,850
easily available otherwise a clinician

618
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:58,660
will not use a system we did some

619
00:25:54,850 --> 00:26:01,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">research about two years ago and we were</font>

620
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:04,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find the most common reason</font>

621
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:11,530
why clinicians or consumers might call

622
00:26:04,150 --> 00:26:16,090
an IT<font color="#E5E5E5"> helpdesk any guesses forgotten</font>

623
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:19,540
passwords forgotten passwords are the

624
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:23,439
most common reason why users of health

625
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:25,990
IT systems call<font color="#CCCCCC"> the helpdesk they might</font>

626
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:27,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">also be instances where a single</font>

627
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:33,730
password is being used by multiple

628
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:36,830
people the other thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the the</font>

629
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:40,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">access to data is affected by people as</font>

630
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:42,350
are the tasks that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are happening so a GP</font>

631
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:44,899
for instance is multitasking all of the

632
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:47,120
time they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to access sometimes more</font>

633
00:26:44,899 --> 00:26:49,729
than one patient's record and they're

634
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,260
interrupted they fail to log off and

635
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:53,690
failing to log off is a very common

636
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:57,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">problem in hospitals as well as is</font>

637
00:26:53,690 --> 00:27:00,380
sharing of passwords it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

638
00:26:57,019 --> 00:27:02,929
know I guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> health care workers or</font>

639
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:04,250
clinicians I don't care about security

640
00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:08,299
it's just that their motivation is to

641
00:27:04,250 --> 00:27:10,700
treat patients and there's no malicious

642
00:27:08,299 --> 00:27:14,899
intent there but they just forget and

643
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:17,360
that's you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> being part of human the</font>

644
00:27:14,899 --> 00:27:19,580
next thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is processes so you know</font>

645
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:22,100
there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a high availability requirement</font>

646
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:25,490
for data delayed access or nor access

647
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:28,039
can present risks to patient safety the

648
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:31,100
data access must not impede clinical

649
00:27:28,039 --> 00:27:33,710
workflow so if you have multiple steps

650
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:36,439
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> log in to a system a clinician might</font>

651
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:38,419
not use it and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason why we're</font>

652
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,429
putting<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of these IT systems in is we</font>

653
00:27:38,419 --> 00:27:41,990
want clinicians to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it an adoption is</font>

654
00:27:40,429 --> 00:27:44,389
a huge issue and once you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to</font>

655
00:27:41,990 --> 00:27:46,399
use it<font color="#CCCCCC"> but then if you block them by you</font>

656
00:27:44,389 --> 00:27:47,809
know excessive security protocols then

657
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:51,199
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to work for example a</font>

658
00:27:47,809 --> 00:27:53,990
dual factor authentication which is you

659
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:55,970
know might be traditionally done it

660
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:57,860
might slow a doctor<font color="#E5E5E5"> down who is treating</font>

661
00:27:55,970 --> 00:28:00,679
a critically ill patient and especially

662
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:05,090
if they forget their password um it

663
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:07,070
would slow them down significantly the

664
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:09,110
other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the all of</font>

665
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:11,299
these things are governed by

666
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:13,490
organizational policies and procedures

667
00:28:11,299 --> 00:28:16,220
so for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have people being</font>

668
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:18,980
trained<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use an IT system and you're</font>

669
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:20,990
covering all of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the staff that are</font>

670
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,850
permanent in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hospital but then</font>

671
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:25,250
sometimes those policies and procedures

672
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:28,129
don't cover casual staff and there's

673
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:29,870
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of casual staff and help for anyone</font>

674
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:31,429
is familiar<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the sector so you might</font>

675
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:33,080
have you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a casual staff member</font>

676
00:28:31,429 --> 00:28:34,789
who's not trained to<font color="#E5E5E5"> use the system not</font>

677
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:37,519
trained in the security<font color="#CCCCCC"> procedures as</font>

678
00:28:34,789 --> 00:28:39,408
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even though they might be</font>

679
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:41,389
training there might be no requirement

680
00:28:39,409 --> 00:28:43,580
on that casual staff to undertake the

681
00:28:41,389 --> 00:28:46,629
training so there's gaps and policies

682
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:49,669
and procedures that<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to be looked at</font>

683
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:51,500
when we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the technology itself</font>

684
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:53,120
think you know I've tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

685
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:55,700
convey to you that clinicians are highly

686
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,290
dependent once on their records and if

687
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">there are electronic records and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

688
00:28:57,290 --> 00:29:01,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">highly dependent on their electronic</font>

689
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:03,920
records the needs of consumers will

690
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:05,870
increase with participation so if you

691
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:08,330
know there's critical information like

692
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:10,040
accessing you know your medications

693
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:11,780
information and you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font>

694
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,639
does to take at the what at what time

695
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:16,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">and if you don't have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that information</font>

696
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:18,350
in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> head then that's defined as then</font>

697
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:20,480
critical information internet

698
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:22,550
connectivity is high we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

699
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,560
know everything in hospitals potentially

700
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:26,450
we can could potentially be connected to

701
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,740
the network and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do need to connect it</font>

702
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:30,920
because we do need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to share that</font>

703
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:33,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">information at the same</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time the</font>

704
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:35,740
resources for IT are limited recently<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

705
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:39,980
only heard for the very first time that

706
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:42,140
now the NHS in in the UK<font color="#E5E5E5"> or in England</font>

707
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,910
has finally you know trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> match</font>

708
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:47,120
their IT budget compared to other

709
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:48,980
sectors so seven to eight percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

710
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,899
above the<font color="#E5E5E5"> healthcare budget is now being</font>

711
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:53,090
spent on IT and that doesn't happen in

712
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:55,520
health as a matter of course it's much

713
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:57,590
much less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than that if you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at</font>

714
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,950
retail and banking that's you know a

715
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:03,649
completely different huge disparity in

716
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:08,420
what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would put to securing or two to</font>

717
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:10,190
IT budget and security sorry so the LA

718
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:12,110
the other thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that IT systems are</font>

719
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:14,120
not that mature so if you you know

720
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:16,580
compare if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go and look at any of the</font>

721
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:18,229
user interfaces of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these systems as well</font>

722
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:20,210
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what's happening in the</font>

723
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,950
background<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're not mature at all</font>

724
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:23,480
compared to other sectors so by

725
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:25,190
definition because we don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough</font>

726
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:28,250
resources being put in the systems are

727
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:30,590
not mature than enough and security

728
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:34,970
sadly is not a priority in system design

729
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:36,709
implementation and use so we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

730
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:38,300
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> security cannot be a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bolt-on at</font>

731
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:40,100
the end it needs to be part of the

732
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:42,860
design implementation and use so there's

733
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:45,530
more effort needed to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know try to</font>

734
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:48,199
integrate security into these processes

735
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:50,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">and so what I've tried</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to kind of give</font>

736
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,090
you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> flavor and just to summarize and</font>

737
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,840
conclude now is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that digital health has</font>

738
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:59,179
many benefits we had there's a

739
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:01,370
tremendous potential and we need IT

740
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:02,640
systems to address you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know major</font>

741
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:04,919
problems that

742
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,390
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> health care system is facing there's</font>

743
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:09,330
no turning back from<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

744
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:11,220
implementing these IT systems so what

745
00:31:09,330 --> 00:31:14,310
what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to sort of say here is</font>

746
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:16,230
that we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to there's no</font>

747
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:18,210
question of going back what we need to

748
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:21,270
do is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just sort of move forward and</font>

749
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:23,370
manage<font color="#E5E5E5"> these cyber threats as you know</font>

750
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:25,320
they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> their they do have a potential</font>

751
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:27,600
to disrupt care delivery and I harm

752
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:29,820
patients I've tried to show<font color="#CCCCCC"> you that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> t</font>

753
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,669
operates in a socio-technical context

754
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:34,169
and security is actually a system

755
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:35,880
property it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just about the</font>

756
00:31:34,170 --> 00:31:38,790
technology it's about the people it's

757
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the processes you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> around that</font>

758
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:42,659
technology and what they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing that</font>

759
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:47,340
makes it really important and in terms

760
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:49,200
of security and most most fundamental

761
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:51,480
requirement is that security strategies

762
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,090
should not impede clinical work or

763
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,830
endanger patient safety and therefore

764
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:59,129
management of cyber threats is really

765
00:31:55,830 --> 00:32:08,699
critical to digital health thanks very

766
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:12,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">much for your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> attention questions what</font>

767
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:12,950
do you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the main threat to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

768
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:21,639
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure we don't have the</font>

769
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:25,149
potential for insurance fraud but um

770
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:27,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you know we still I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we're</font>

771
00:32:25,149 --> 00:32:29,860
spending you know still a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money</font>

772
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:32,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">and health and we still digitizing our</font>

773
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:33,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">systems so the thing is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in actual fact</font>

774
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:35,769
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> health care systems or the</font>

775
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:38,370
healthcare IT systems in the US are a

776
00:32:35,769 --> 00:32:40,840
little bit behind Australia we're very

777
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:42,639
highly computerized they've only started

778
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:44,529
to be started to<font color="#E5E5E5"> catch up in the last</font>

779
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:47,110
couple of years<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> especially if you</font>

780
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:49,870
look at general practice so i would say

781
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:52,120
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> although most of the stuff that</font>

782
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:54,008
<font color="#E5E5E5">i've talked about is about the u.s.</font>

783
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:55,360
there is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's much more</font>

784
00:32:54,009 --> 00:32:57,100
reporting and there's much more

785
00:32:55,360 --> 00:33:00,459
information that can be found and

786
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:01,719
presented it doesn't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's not</font>

787
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:04,200
happening here it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just not being</font>

788
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,200
reported

789
00:33:13,149 --> 00:33:20,468
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so basically this is talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

790
00:33:16,089 --> 00:33:23,229
the National my health record system um

791
00:33:20,469 --> 00:33:26,559
and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the access to my health record is</font>

792
00:33:23,229 --> 00:33:31,179
why am I golf and everything that all

793
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:34,570
the security requirements for my gov

794
00:33:31,179 --> 00:33:35,889
apply to my health record so basically

795
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:37,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you want to get into your my health</font>

796
00:33:35,889 --> 00:33:40,508
record you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to get in my a mygov and</font>

797
00:33:37,989 --> 00:33:43,119
if you can't remember<font color="#E5E5E5"> the complicated ID</font>

798
00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:49,599
number and the three questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

799
00:33:43,119 --> 00:33:58,408
you're in trouble do you feel astray

800
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:58,408
leads to love something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like um I think</font>

801
00:34:00,089 --> 00:34:04,539
sorry I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of like this is new</font>

802
00:34:03,099 --> 00:34:09,369
for me to read the question and answer

803
00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:12,038
so um I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the answer to that is we</font>

804
00:34:09,369 --> 00:34:14,169
it's not so much about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> HIPAA policy</font>

805
00:34:12,039 --> 00:34:17,950
it's not so much about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the privacy</font>

806
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:20,500
protection we do need privacy protection

807
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:23,848
here and I think we do have enough of it

808
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:26,109
but it's more about reporting things

809
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:27,940
reporting data breaches so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would say</font>

810
00:34:26,109 --> 00:34:29,230
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know we do need to be reporting</font>

811
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,480
our data breaches and being more

812
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:33,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">transparent about what's going on</font>

813
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,379
because otherwise if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what</font>

814
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:37,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">the problem is then how you're going to</font>

815
00:34:35,379 --> 00:34:37,770
solve it

816
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:48,949
so it's not fairly new and health as

817
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:51,350
I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> said you know our GPS have been</font>

818
00:34:48,949 --> 00:34:53,029
computerized for many many years and and

819
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:56,779
they're really at the forefront in

820
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:58,610
hospitals you know it's sort of variable

821
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:00,710
across the board so some hospitals are

822
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:03,140
highly highly digitize it's not new and

823
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:06,650
others are catching up so it's it's kind

824
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:10,190
of and as I sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you know addressed</font>

825
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:13,190
in my talk the<font color="#E5E5E5"> budget for health IT is</font>

826
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:17,330
not that great<font color="#E5E5E5"> so when you have there's</font>

827
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:19,220
no kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of gold plating here at all you</font>

828
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:21,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">just often there's not once you've</font>

829
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:23,029
procured the technology there's not

830
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:25,940
enough to even implement the systems and

831
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:32,110
make them work so we're talking about a

832
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:32,110
highly under-resourced problem here

833
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:52,689
so as<font color="#CCCCCC"> far as data classification i'm not</font>

834
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:54,840
sure if<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've really understood your</font>

835
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:57,970
question so there's a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of there are</font>

836
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:59,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">healthcare classifications if that's</font>

837
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:01,270
what you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about but I sort of</font>

838
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,910
have a feeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're talking about some</font>

839
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:06,730
other kind of data classifications as in

840
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:18,690
isn't you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the sensitivity of</font>

841
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:18,690
information is that yep

842
00:36:24,930 --> 00:36:37,870
yeah yeah so I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> did the straight</font>

843
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:40,600
answer to that is i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not sure but i</font>

844
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:42,339
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be done at that</font>

845
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:44,049
level like because a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system</font>

846
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:48,010
that we procuring are basically from

847
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:50,230
vendors in the US and unless that's been

848
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:51,700
done you know explicitly for an

849
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:54,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">australian setting i don't think that</font>

850
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:57,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">happens in the background</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there would be</font>

851
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:59,350
you know access controls are kind of

852
00:36:57,610 --> 00:37:01,240
what you<font color="#CCCCCC"> would hear being talked about</font>

853
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:04,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">so who on the health care team needs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

854
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:07,779
access what bits of information and even

855
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:11,290
that is kind of really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard so what</font>

856
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:13,660
comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to mind is it is an IT safety</font>

857
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:15,880
event that you know we looked at and

858
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:17,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">this was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in england where a patient</font>

859
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:21,430
comes into an<font color="#CCCCCC"> emergency room and gets</font>

860
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:23,590
treated right and they are they were HIV

861
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:27,129
positive and so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

862
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:29,080
information a test<font color="#E5E5E5"> was ordered and that</font>

863
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:31,780
the result of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that test was not</font>

864
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:34,600
available<font color="#E5E5E5"> to anybody else other than the</font>

865
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:36,400
ordering clinician and what sadly

866
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,319
happened was when that patient<font color="#E5E5E5"> got</font>

867
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,020
readmitted to hospital because they

868
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,820
couldn't see that test<font color="#E5E5E5"> resulted they</font>

869
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,960
kept treating that patient but they

870
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:46,420
didn't have that critical piece of

871
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:49,150
information and unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

872
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:50,530
patient died of an infection so they

873
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:53,260
didn't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they were HIV positive</font>

874
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:56,320
until<font color="#CCCCCC"> that test came back but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that test</font>

875
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:57,750
didn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> read for a long time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and that</font>

876
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:59,920
patient was still being treated because

877
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:02,680
they were now being treated by somebody

878
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:09,000
else so it's kind of the information

879
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:09,000
governance is not simple um yep

880
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:19,940
I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that i can come back</font>

881
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,940
to you Jeffrey

882
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:38,260
so yes there is a huge trend to move

883
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:40,180
applications to the cloud so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think one</font>

884
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:42,340
of the major vendors and general

885
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:48,399
practice just<font color="#E5E5E5"> this week announced you</font>

886
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:50,290
know a cloud version of their system we

887
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't know whether it is increasing the</font>

888
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:55,240
risk of data loss because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> only now</font>

889
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:58,510
starting to happen but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think for GPS</font>

890
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:01,779
the cloud as long as it's done right it

891
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:03,400
in some ways it could be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> answer to</font>

892
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:05,170
many questions because if you're talking

893
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a GP who is sitting on their own</font>

894
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:08,290
in a practice they don't have a lot of

895
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:10,600
resources so they don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an IT</font>

896
00:39:08,290 --> 00:39:13,240
person<font color="#E5E5E5"> on site there's usually you know</font>

897
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:15,279
the contracting or that services<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:17,709
provided by somebody else external to

899
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,330
the two so the backup and all of those

900
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:20,890
things if things are on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud then</font>

901
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:24,250
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> that happens in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> background um</font>

902
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:29,799
without you know GP the practice itself

903
