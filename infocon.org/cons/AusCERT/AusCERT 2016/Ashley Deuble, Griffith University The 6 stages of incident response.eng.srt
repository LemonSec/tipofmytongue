do bleh hey how's it going I actually

10
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,200
didn't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this room would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be as busy</font>

11
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,390
so that's pretty cool so look incident

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,489
response is something we all think that

13
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">we know how to do we also to understand</font>

14
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,489
the concepts and stuff right but when

15
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">the incident happens we don't actually</font>

16
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:57,599
follow our thought pattern we don't

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,219
think straight we don't cover off what

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,309
we need to do we lose evidence all that

19
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,930
sort of stuff so I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> take today</font>

20
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:06,780
out as a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a refresher for all of</font>

21
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,369
us just to get us<font color="#E5E5E5"> back on track I've got</font>

22
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,530
some resources at the end so hopefully

23
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:11,760
you know you can get an instant response

24
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,020
plan all that sort of stuff take it back

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the office and start filling that</font>

26
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:19,350
sort of stuff out and getting something

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,000
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> place now the beginning of the week I</font>

28
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,439
had the opportunity to sit down with the

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,420
guys<font color="#E5E5E5"> from assert they did a day-long</font>

30
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,699
training session on cyber incident

31
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:29,790
response we all love cyber right Scotty

32
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,900
love cyber um but the alarming thing was

33
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,369
is at the beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> we all went around</font>

34
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,540
the room and we all talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

35
00:01:32,369 --> 00:01:36,420
want to get out of it and this certain

36
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,430
the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it seemed like almost half</font>

37
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,409
the room there either didn't have an

38
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,990
incident<font color="#E5E5E5"> response plan all that incident</font>

39
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:45,630
response plan was absolute crap now I

40
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:49,320
mean half the room isn't prepared that's

41
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:54,449
really alarming to me so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know we</font>

42
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:55,798
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to get better at this so what do we</font>

43
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:58,829
need instant response you know why is

44
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,390
this such an important thing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us we</font>

45
00:01:58,829 --> 00:02:01,979
all know incidents happen day in day out

46
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,469
all shapes all sizes all colors

47
00:02:01,979 --> 00:02:05,729
different varieties you know this isn't

48
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:10,019
a new thing it's only going to get worse

49
00:02:05,729 --> 00:02:10,800
as time goes on if we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not prepared it</font>

50
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,610
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean the difference between</font>

51
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,040
success and failure your company

52
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:16,570
if you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got an internal customer</font>

53
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,620
database that gets put<font color="#E5E5E5"> on pastebin or</font>

54
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,120
something and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't thought about</font>

55
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:21,640
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know how to deal with</font>

56
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that's your reputation gone you</font>

57
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,570
might not come back from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that likewise</font>

58
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">if your ebay or paypal or something like</font>

59
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,299
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do is take payments and</font>

60
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:30,130
you can't take those payments because

61
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:32,470
someone's<font color="#CCCCCC"> taken your system down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

62
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:36,010
don't react in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right way you're</font>

63
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:38,290
naked you might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> other sort of</font>

64
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,390
contractual or legal requirements or

65
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,920
regulatory requirements you know pti you

66
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:43,208
might be dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> health data all</font>

67
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,679
that sort of stuff where you need to

68
00:02:43,209 --> 00:02:47,650
have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort of incident response plan</font>

69
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,850
in there to get your cyber insurance you

70
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:52,600
need to show that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an instant</font>

71
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:55,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">response</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> plan and you followed that now</font>

72
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:58,570
the last little thing there is some

73
00:02:55,540 --> 00:03:00,910
research<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to you aided so they went</font>

74
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:02,170
off they surveyed a bunch of companies

75
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:03,850
bunch of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> industries and all</font>

76
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,809
that sort of stuff and they came back

77
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,370
and they said three and four

78
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,130
organizations had suffered some sort of

79
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:11,260
cyber security breach so that's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

80
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:14,890
numbers sixty percent of those were

81
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:18,070
categorized as serious now if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

82
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:21,750
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what I saw on Monday we're thinking</font>

83
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:24,070
you know half of those people at least

84
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,720
haven't got an instant response plan so

85
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:28,390
already a quarter of those people there

86
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:31,120
are ill-prepared and don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to</font>

87
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:33,160
deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with this the other thing I take</font>

88
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,299
away from this is that one in four

89
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:40,299
people don't know where<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look for that</font>

90
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:41,590
incident so good<font color="#CCCCCC"> luck to them so we're</font>

91
00:03:40,299 --> 00:03:44,230
going to talk about six stages of

92
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:46,209
incident response this does for there's

93
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,160
other people to do three but as we've

94
00:03:46,209 --> 00:03:50,769
heard Thomas<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about this morning all</font>

95
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">set supporting sex you know sans if you</font>

96
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:54,610
do any of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their courses</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on incident</font>

97
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,380
handling they support six and incident

98
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:58,120
handling as six stages is a bit more

99
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:00,549
granular it's easier to sort of

100
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,519
segregate the information and provide

101
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:05,019
that back to your management so we're

102
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,900
going to talk about preparation what we

103
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:09,310
need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ready if you want to dig a</font>

104
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,360
hole at home you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just go out into</font>

105
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">the front yard and start digging with</font>

106
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,780
your hands<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go outside you put some</font>

107
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,220
sunscreen on a hat some gloves you get a

108
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,298
shovel you get a wheelbarrow you work

109
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,060
out where you're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put that dirt</font>

110
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:20,320
same thing with instant response we need

111
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,849
to know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to do we need</font>

112
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,270
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all our tools</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and everything in</font>

113
00:04:21,849 --> 00:04:26,409
place we then move on to the

114
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:29,229
identification failure

115
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,840
is this an incident or is this just an

116
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:33,670
event if it's an incident what's the

117
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,560
scope of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> incident how big is it</font>

118
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:39,040
what's it you know what's it reaching to

119
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:42,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">you we then go and talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

120
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,390
containment phases<font color="#CCCCCC"> long-term containment</font>

121
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,710
short-term containment what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> we going</font>

122
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:48,070
to do we go and pull plugs we're going

123
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:49,719
to try and patch stuff from there we

124
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,430
move on to eradication how do we get the

125
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,140
bad guys out how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we fix this incident</font>

126
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:56,110
how do we make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not going to</font>

127
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:57,760
come back once we've done that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

128
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:59,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">about recovery when are we going to put</font>

129
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:02,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">these systems back into production and</font>

130
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:04,330
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting things kicking along again</font>

131
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,740
and then last but not least we go into

132
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,690
the lessons<font color="#CCCCCC"> learnt where we talked about</font>

133
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:09,610
what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did well what we did crap you</font>

134
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:12,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">know what we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we haven't got</font>

135
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,200
all that sort of stuff then we feed that

136
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:20,230
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> into our preparation phase and you</font>

137
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:21,789
know wait for the next incident so we'll

138
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:22,750
spend a bit of time on preparation

139
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:27,940
there's a lot of stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

140
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:30,250
here um people in awareness<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really</font>

141

important<font color="#CCCCCC"> here the majority of the</font>

unacceptable from security point of view

what looks bad what looks good how can

148

186
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,440
it's no good<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> incident on a</font>

196
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,190
so yeah you can do whatever you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

197
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:42,870
we still<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have the access so we</font>

198
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:46,289
need to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can get access</font>

00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:49,350
to these systems we might<font color="#CCCCCC"> also need</font>

200
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:51,900
access to facilities it's after hours

201
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:53,900
you know we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to send an IRT min but</font>

202
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:58,370
my swipe card doesn't work on this side

203
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">we need to think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about that beforehand</font>

204
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:04,830
our response plan or a response strategy

205
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:06,539
not all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us are going to handle</font>

206
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:09,300
instant response we might push it off to

207
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:11,610
a third party we still need<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> response</font>

208
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,320
plan that says that though we still need

209
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:14,880
a response plan that tells us the

210
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,130
different roles<font color="#E5E5E5"> and responsibilities</font>

211
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,800
within the organization who should be

212
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:21,690
doing what at what time who should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

213
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,789
invoking crisis management teams who

214
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:26,969
should be going and contacting the

215
00:08:23,789 --> 00:08:28,530
marketing people the legal<font color="#E5E5E5"> people think</font>

216
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:31,740
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> your incident response plan as your</font>

217
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:34,079
PlayBook it's like when we do dr testing

218
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:36,659
we have a dr guide we have like a

219
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,700
process that we follow we all do that

220
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:40,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">once a year we follow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that God we know</font>

221
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,659
what everyone's going to do in at what

222
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:45,510
point we need the same thing for

223
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:47,640
incidents we need to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to follow</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

224
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,839
guide and think clearly and know what we

225
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:51,290
meant to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be doing and who's meant to be</font>

00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:51,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing what</font>

227
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:58,310
we need to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the tools that we</font>

228
00:08:53,810 --> 00:09:00,800
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use we might need forensic tools</font>

229
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:04,430
we might need anti-malware tools we

230
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:07,930
might need dr duplicators talons we

231
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:10,489
might need network switches network hubs

232
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:16,849
think about the stuff that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we might need</font>

233
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:21,080
before something bad happens we want to

234
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:23,060
think about our communication once an

235
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:25,520
incident occurs someone's breached our

236
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:28,069
network do we feel comfortable<font color="#CCCCCC"> using our</font>

237
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:32,810
VoIP phones do we feel comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

238
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:34,610
our corporate email systems do we want

239
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">to use mobiles do we want to just say</font>

240
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:39,200
everyone gather round we're going to

241
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:40,820
talk about this around<font color="#E5E5E5"> a desk start</font>

242
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,709
thinking about communications back to

243
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,820
management as well we need to alert

244
00:09:42,709 --> 00:09:45,800
management that something Bad's

245
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:50,540
happening we'll keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> you updated but</font>

246
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:54,740
just so you're aware we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

247
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:57,560
space a war room if it's a significant

248
00:09:54,740 --> 00:10:01,579
incident it might go for days weeks who

249
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:03,380
knows we might need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have a room where</font>

250
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:04,550
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get everyone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in there that people</font>

251
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,770
can't see the sensitive information

252
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:09,500
where you can scribble on walls scribble

253
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:10,819
on whiteboards we can talk it out lock

254
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,220
the door at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and then</font>

255
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:16,490
come back later on we might be running

256
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:18,110
shifts to deal with this incident we

257
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,700
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a daytime shift and then a</font>

258
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:22,339
nighttime shift comes in we might need

259
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:25,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> handover think about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having that</font>

260
00:10:22,339 --> 00:10:27,649
place ready it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> just be an offer</font>

261
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:29,240
somewhere it might be a conference<font color="#CCCCCC"> room</font>

262
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:33,520
whatever but you need to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to kick</font>

263
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,520
people out lock it keep stuff in there

264
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:40,339
think about the documentation you have

265
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:43,730
if I'm working an incident and i'm

266
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:46,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at a database server and I see</font>

267
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:48,350
funky accounts I seaports it shouldn't

268
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,510
be open in my eyes and I see traffic

269
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:53,000
going around and connecting two systems

270
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:54,649
unless I have some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of security</font>

271
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,170
architecture document or some

272
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:59,870
documentation that the team has written

273
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:03,939
to tell me what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is we're not going to</font>

274
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:03,940
know what's normal and what's not

275
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,230
you'll soon find out after your first

276
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,310
few incidents that you need more and

277
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:14,430
more documentation to make this happen

278
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:15,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the last ones training while you</font>

279
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:17,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">have your subject matter experts and</font>

280
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:20,040
they know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what they're doing within</font>

281
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,480
their role they might<font color="#E5E5E5"> not know how to go</font>

282
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,760
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> find that information for you when</font>

283
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,590
you need it I need you to interrogate

284
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,000
this or find that or whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> I look for</font>

285
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:28,980
these services look for these accounts

286
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,240
they might not<font color="#E5E5E5"> know how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

287
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:32,730

training in the incident response

290
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:38,609
process so when it all goes pear-shaped

291
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:40,620
when everyone's all flustered<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what they're doing it's</font>

293
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,580
just a knee-jerk reaction it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

business continuity a disaster recovery

stuff people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have worked incidents</font>

296
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:56,640
know the value of a jump bag a jump bag

297
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:59,390
is a bag of bottle whatever it is and

298
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,710
just sit somewhere close by to you an

299
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:04,650
incident happens and you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got all the</font>

00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:06,240
stuff you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> handle that these are</font>

301
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:08,130
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of just the basic things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

302
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,840
should have in that jump bag so if an

303
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:12,120
incident occurs at midnight you can go

304
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:15,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">and grab that bag kick off and handle</font>

305
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:18,180
stuff we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have a journal in there</font>

00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:22,079
something that's has bound pages and

page numbers when we start working<font color="#CCCCCC"> Islam</font>

308
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,980
we want to make as many notes as we can

00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,630
you can't go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> in time and put new</font>

you're doing it as you're clicking the

out you've got continuity of your notes

316
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:41,400
and all that sort of stuff it's very

347
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:54,690
have some drive drive duplicators or

<font color="#CCCCCC">write blockers a lot of our forensics</font>

349
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:58,260
tools will do Network acquisition but

350
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,670
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be the odd case where</font>

you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't do a snapshot you can't do a</font>

353
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:08,210
duplicate the drive use a drive blocking

354
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,210
you can't stuff the original evidence up

355
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:15,750
so we've got all our preparation done

356
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:19,110
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you know someone's come up and</font>

357
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,850
said look bad stuffs happening help we

358
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:24,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">need to work out what's in a you know an</font>

359
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:25,950
event and what's an incident so<font color="#CCCCCC"> nist</font>

360
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:27,900
awesomely says an incident is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the act of</font>

361
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:30,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">violating explicit or implied security</font>

362
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:34,050
policy at super vague we've got policies

363
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:35,640
but that could mean anything us-cert

364
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:37,620
then come<font color="#CCCCCC"> and put some examples in there</font>

365
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,210
so attempts either failed its successful

366
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,820
to gain on through unauthorized access

367
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:44,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">to a system or its data so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one's</font>

368
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:47,220
fair enough and I'm wanted to disruption

369
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:49,950
or denial of service which is fair

370
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,600
enough as well the unauthorized use of a

371
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:53,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">system for the processing of storage of</font>

372
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,070

00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:57,390
warcraft<font color="#E5E5E5"> server in our data center</font>

374
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:59,100

377
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:05,100
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> start getting an idea of what</font>

378
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:07,859
could be<font color="#E5E5E5"> an incident here it could be</font>

many things you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it might be other</font>

380
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,930
than this could be anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to</font>

381
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:14,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">think of it as has there been a</font>

00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">didn't write it down we think we know</font>

428
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:58,780
what we did but we can't quite remember

429
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:01,090
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we did so much stuff always</font>

430
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:02,920
document the who what where when and how

431
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:04,930
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know who we're going to have to</font>

432
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,670
provide this to you might have to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

433
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:08,140
police might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a court might</font>

434
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:10,120
have to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a third party and might</font>

435
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:12,250
just have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> stay internal but unless we</font>

436
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:17,739
have that we don't know so document that

437
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:21,369
as much<font color="#CCCCCC"> as we can if possible have two</font>

438
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:24,579
incident handlers I say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because in</font>

439
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:27,310
the early stages of<font color="#E5E5E5"> an incident there's</font>

440
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:28,960
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening we're trying to</font>

441
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:30,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">determine what's causing this issue</font>

442
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,290
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to determine how we're</font>

443
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:34,810
going to stop it what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the extent is all</font>

444
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:36,850
that sort of stuff you're going to have

445
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:39,700
one incident handler that's going to

446
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:41,770
just be looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at stuff is this useful</font>

447
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,870
is this useful is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> rubbish is this</font>

448
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:46,010
just noise whatever

449
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:48,229
the first thing I said<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is we want to</font>

450
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,549
start documenting everything we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

451
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:51,020
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> collecting all this in a</font>

452
00:17:49,549 --> 00:17:53,120
constructive manner we want to document

453
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:55,010
how we're collecting this<font color="#E5E5E5"> evidence on</font>

454
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,139
what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with it your first</font>

455
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:59,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">person can then go and say I need this</font>

456
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:01,669
this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and this collected the</font>

457
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:05,390
second person can then come<font color="#CCCCCC"> in with a</font>

458
00:18:01,669 --> 00:18:07,070
cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> head calm collected start gathering</font>

459
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:10,070
that evidence and documenting how

460
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:11,689
they've gathered that evidence once

461
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:13,720
they've gathered that evidence they can

462
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,890
start establishing the chain<font color="#CCCCCC"> of custody</font>

463
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:18,230
chain of custody is really important it

464
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:20,809
says who had access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this data at what</font>

465
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:22,880
time when and who they passed it on to

466
00:18:20,809 --> 00:18:25,129
everyone signing it everyone's aware of

467
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,169
it we need to fill these chain of

468
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:28,520
custody forms out if we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go and</font>

469
00:18:27,169 --> 00:18:34,250
take this to the police to court or

470
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:35,629
whoever once we determine the<font color="#E5E5E5"> full scope</font>

471
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:43,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">and we start doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we can start</font>

472
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:43,090
moving on to<font color="#CCCCCC"> our next phases maybe</font>

473
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:47,559
so we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move on to containment we</font>

474
00:18:46,269 --> 00:18:49,389
want to limit or prevent any<font color="#E5E5E5"> further</font>

475
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,799
damage from occurring we want to stop

476
00:18:49,389 --> 00:18:52,748
all the bad stuff we've got a denial

477
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:55,389
service we've got all our customer

478
00:18:52,749 --> 00:18:58,929
database leaking out somewhere all this

479
00:18:55,389 --> 00:19:00,668
sort of jazz we want to stop that in

480
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:02,529
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases we want to allow that to</font>

481
00:19:00,669 --> 00:19:06,850
continue for some time we might want to

482
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:08,320
gather better evidence a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

483
00:19:06,850 --> 00:19:10,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">will let</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff go on so I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

484
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:13,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">better logs better evidence and try and</font>

485
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:15,158
go for attribution I think now if we

486
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,600
start<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking to the people like you</font>

487
00:19:15,159 --> 00:19:19,119
know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the FBI's change their mind</font>

488
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:22,869
mangin all those guys attributions hard

489
00:19:19,119 --> 00:19:25,299
and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do know who did this you know</font>

490
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:26,860
it's going to be China Russia Syria

491
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:29,529
whoever we don't really have the

492
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:31,508
jurisdiction is it worth the effort do

493
00:19:29,529 --> 00:19:33,789
you want to get your payment gateway

494
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:36,309
back online or do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to work out</font>

495
00:19:33,789 --> 00:19:38,230
who's doing this and why it's a business

496
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:42,940
decision that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to make I can't</font>

497
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:44,679
<font color="#CCCCCC">make that for you we've got a few</font>

498
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:46,299
factors that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about and</font>

499
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:51,039
when we work out what our containment

500
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:52,450
strategy is going to be we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work</font>

501
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,389
out what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the potential damage or theft</font>

502
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:56,649
of the resources is going to be do we

503
00:19:55,389 --> 00:19:58,928
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do a short-term containment</font>

504
00:19:56,649 --> 00:20:00,100
long-term containment whatever if it's

505
00:19:58,929 --> 00:20:03,399
bad enough we might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to just pull</font>

506
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:07,090
the system offline what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

507
00:20:03,399 --> 00:20:08,559
requirements for evidence collection do

508
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:11,249
we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to allow this to go on for quite</font>

509
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:16,210
some time so we can gather more evidence

510
00:20:11,249 --> 00:20:21,100
our service availability on paypal I

511
00:20:16,210 --> 00:20:22,480
can't take payments crap time and

512
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,719
resources required to implement the

513
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:28,659
containment strategy it might be new

514
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:31,659
year's day all that staff a drunk

515
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:34,899
hungover looking for bacon we can't do

516
00:20:31,659 --> 00:20:39,039
anything you know it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> easy to</font>

517
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:41,678
just pull the plug how<font color="#CCCCCC"> effective is our</font>

518
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,360
containment strategy going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be you</font>

519
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,509
know are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just remove the</font>

00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,279
audit count shut<font color="#E5E5E5"> down a service put on a</font>

521

patch fingers<font color="#CCCCCC"> cross it's going to rock</font>

522
00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:55,619
we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know and how long do we want</font>

523
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:55,619
this containment strategy go on for

524
00:20:56,460 --> 00:21:01,179
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we start diddling with any of</font>

525
00:20:58,929 --> 00:21:04,059
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> systems we want to start taking</font>

526
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:07,419
forensic images use known<font color="#E5E5E5"> good forensic</font>

527
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:08,799
tools use your ft<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kaiser</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in cases where</font>

528
00:21:07,419 --> 00:21:12,309
it comes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> words start using DD</font>

529
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,840
whatever you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do one of the</font>

530
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:16,178
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> things here is when you make</font>

531
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:19,029
these images you make your image you get

532
00:21:16,179 --> 00:21:21,850
your hash of your file make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

533
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:23,259
images sound and not corrupt I've worked

534
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">on so many cases where we've had our</font>

535
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:26,200
young guys come in and<font color="#CCCCCC"> do all the</font>

536
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:29,229
imaging for us and when we go to process

537
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:32,610
it at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the end of the day the images are</font>

538
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:35,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuffed and we can't do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything with it</font>

539
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:39,908
make sure they work do the validation

540
00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:40,929
it's an easy thing to do so we start

541
00:21:39,909 --> 00:21:42,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking do we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do some</font>

542
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:43,950
short-term containment some long-term

543
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:45,610
containment something in between

544
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:47,980
short-term we're just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pull the</font>

545
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:50,498
system offline we just need to do

546
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,210
something quick now we'll only do it

547
00:21:50,499 --> 00:21:53,259
will bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> up another server or patch up</font>

548
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:56,919
we'll do whatever we need to do but

549
00:21:53,259 --> 00:21:58,629
let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this fixed for now longer</font>

550
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:00,220
term strategies you know we might put

551
00:21:58,629 --> 00:22:04,149
temporary fixes in there we might remove

552
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:07,149
accounts disabled services firewall

553
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:10,689
rules patch who knows we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to take</font>

554
00:22:07,149 --> 00:22:12,758
<font color="#E5E5E5">that on a case-by-case basis but at the</font>

555
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:15,429
end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've contained it we're not</font>

556
00:22:12,759 --> 00:22:18,309
having any more issues we've stopped<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

557
00:22:15,429 --> 00:22:19,960
bad guys from doing bad stuff you know

558
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:21,700
sure we<font color="#CCCCCC"> might have stuff on pastebin or</font>

559
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:27,490
whatever but you know we're stopping it

560
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:29,529
from from continuing on we move on to

561
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:33,879
eradication we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get rid of all</font>

562
00:22:29,529 --> 00:22:35,830
the bad then our first point here is

563
00:22:33,879 --> 00:22:38,189
around ensuring that proper measures

564
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:40,869
have been taken to clean the system up

565
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:43,840
you're a brave brave person if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you think</font>

566
00:22:40,869 --> 00:22:45,939
you can clean a system up if somebody

567
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,860

568
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:49,059
what they've done you might get rid of

569
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,979
all the accounts you might get rid of

570
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:53,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the files and think you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> done it</font>

571
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:55,869
but how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they don't have a</font>

00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:57,700
back door that will open<font color="#CCCCCC"> up to port</font>

573
00:22:55,869 --> 00:23:00,009
knocking knock on certain ports at

574
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:02,320
certain times in certain order oh there

575
00:23:00,009 --> 00:23:06,519
we go back<font color="#E5E5E5"> door how do we know we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

576
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">have root kits in there the best way to</font>

577
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:08,999
go about it is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to reimage the</font>

578
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:14,939
system

579
00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:19,669
use known good media or use good knowing

580
00:23:14,939 --> 00:23:22,499
backups the<font color="#E5E5E5"> backup part is the hardest</font>

581
00:23:19,669 --> 00:23:24,089
because we saw something<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen today we</font>

582
00:23:22,499 --> 00:23:26,519
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know when it happened originally</font>

583
00:23:24,089 --> 00:23:28,438
we don't know the start I think the

584
00:23:26,519 --> 00:23:33,029
average time is like three to four

585
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:35,399
months for detection if you can't

586
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:38,309
validate in that three to four months or

587
00:23:35,399 --> 00:23:42,119
before you don't know if it's clean you

588
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:45,918
don't know if it's good it<font color="#CCCCCC"> might not be</font>

589
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:48,418
a viable backup<font color="#E5E5E5"> four months old as well</font>

590
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:51,209
so we do a reimage and then we start

591
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:53,129
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at improving our defenses what</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">putting this stuff back into production</font>

598
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:19,829
we need to really<font color="#CCCCCC"> think hard here how</font>

599
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:21,179
we're going to test a system to make

600
00:24:19,829 --> 00:24:23,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure it's ready to go back into</font>

601
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:25,769

604
00:24:27,359 --> 00:24:33,389
it's clean do we have the right<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools to</font>

00:24:30,509 --> 00:24:40,019
test that can we monitor it can we

606
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:41,758
validate it how long are we going to

607
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:43,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">monitor the system once its back into</font>

that out with the system owners we work

612
00:24:53,099 --> 00:24:58,259
that out with our cert team we determine

00:24:55,289 --> 00:24:59,939
what we're going to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> here then</font>

00:24:58,259 --> 00:25:01,169
<font color="#CCCCCC">together with the system owner we decide</font>

615
00:24:59,939 --> 00:25:03,479
when we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put this all back</font>

616
00:25:01,169 --> 00:25:05,459
into production when is the best time

00:25:03,479 --> 00:25:07,199
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you got people there to watch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

618
00:25:05,459 --> 00:25:08,819
when we got people<font color="#E5E5E5"> there that know</font>

619
00:25:07,199 --> 00:25:10,889
what's going on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can see if anything</font>

620
00:25:08,819 --> 00:25:13,168

guys there

623
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:22,390
so we successfully recover our system we

624
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:24,880
put it back into production everyone's

625
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:27,340
happy there's lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> high fives we go</font>

626
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,770
into our lessons learn to me this is the

627
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:31,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">most critical phase because a lot of</font>

628
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:33,430
stuff happens in an incident and every

629
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:35,950
incident is different you're never going

630
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:37,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get the same incident so this is</font>

631
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:42,640
where we learn from<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we've done this</font>

632
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:44,889
is where we make ourselves better if you

633
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,190
start at any documentation as a part of

634
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:49,300
the incident finish<font color="#CCCCCC"> it off now</font>

635
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:51,790
management have made sure that you've

636
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:54,220
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> all your staff together as an</font>

00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:56,139
instant response team use that while you

638
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,370
can in two three weeks time they're

639
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,510
going to be back on<font color="#E5E5E5"> operational tasks</font>

640
00:25:57,370 --> 00:26:00,879
and they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do any of the</font>

641
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:02,320
other documentation for you get it done

642
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:06,670
while everyone's there well there's a

643
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:09,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">bit of enthusiasm from everyone get your</font>

644
00:26:06,670 --> 00:26:10,920
system documentation done any I our

645
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:14,260
documentation done process has changed

646
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:15,460
any emergency cab stuff that you might

647
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:18,090
not have put in you might have just

648
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:22,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">bypassed a few systems and being agile</font>

649
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:24,520
do all that stuff right then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

650
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:25,780
start creating our formal report we want

651
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:29,350
to give a report to all the stakeholders

652
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:30,910
involved in the incident so we want to

653
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:35,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">cover the who what where when how the</font>

654
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:38,200
incident we make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that report we give it</font>

655
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:40,830
out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> organise to have a</font>

656
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:44,020
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of lessons learned meetings I</font>

657
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:45,639
would have at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> two one with our I</font>

658
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,500
our team and one with our management

659
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:49,840
team they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be pitched at</font>

660
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:51,820
different levels we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cover</font>

661
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,959
the same stuff off but the I our team

662
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,450
will probably be the<font color="#CCCCCC"> more technical</font>

663
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,400
nature and management will know why it

664
00:26:55,450 --> 00:27:00,640
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it happened you know who do</font>

665
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:02,950
I point a finger at so we have a

666
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,720
presentation we cover who detected the

667
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:07,690
initial problem and when they detected

668
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:10,510
it what the scope of the initial

669
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:13,210
incident was what did it affect how many

670
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:14,050
systems just<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we hit a web server</font>

671
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:16,270
it doesn't mean it didn't affect

672
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:20,620
database servers single sign-on servers

673
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:25,750
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sara etc how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we contain and</font>

674
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:31,020
eradicate the issue what worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> it out</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">by our team do to fix this</font>

676
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:37,430
was the sea search team effective did

677
00:27:35,370 --> 00:27:39,540
they do a good job did they get on it

678
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:42,210
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> there places where we could do it</font>

679
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:44,180
you know could have done better other

00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:46,320
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't have done</font>

681
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:49,830
we need to really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a good hard long</font>

682
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,360
look at that and then put aside some

683

really good quality<font color="#E5E5E5"> time to sit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> down</font>

00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:01,050
their feedback at their suggestions we

<font color="#E5E5E5">air conditioning on it was hot as hell</font>

or there was no coffee you know or you

691
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,230
know we did these three processes and we

692
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:15,540
could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> done that in one go there's a</font>

693
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:17,190
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that there and as we go through</font>

694
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,690
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> do more and more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of these we can</font>

695
00:28:17,190 --> 00:28:22,950
streamline those processes and do a

00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:24,720
better job so get all the information

do we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have new processes all</font>

702
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:42,660
that sort of jazz and with that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

at the end of the day the importance of

that incident and what those guys came

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and did overshadowed that so I think</font>

we need to do but we know we need to

the incidents happening you still got to

00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:38,280
I think we're going to follow the same

process you need to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at your you</font>

attacking<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean at the end of the day</font>

819
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,020
it's just attacking a system your zero

820
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:54,179
day you just still need to have those

821
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:55,920
processes when it happens to know how to

822
00:33:54,179 --> 00:33:57,660
deal<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's</font>

anything I can say from an incident

824
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:02,940
response point of view that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you should</font>

825
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:19,949
do this to stop that that answer your

826
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:21,149
question not really yeah sure I mean

827
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:22,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">like if you've got your seam and all</font>

828
00:34:21,149 --> 00:34:24,029
that sort of stuff you can put you in

829
00:34:22,168 --> 00:34:25,350
tell your threat feeds in there you can

830
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:27,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">start doing threat modeling and things</font>

831
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:28,560
like that to work out you know where

832
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:31,919
your holes are and what you should be

833
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:34,859
looking at that's a start you know just

834
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:36,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">a part of everyday operational security</font>

835
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:38,639
in my eyes it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not a part of instant</font>

836
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,529
response there's certain things that we

837
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,119
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for you know and you</font>

838
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:43,169
know you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about your socks</font>

839
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:45,359
your seams and all that sort of stuff

840
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:48,839
and you should be able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get enough</font>

841
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:50,369
information from that traffic over time

842
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:55,250
to know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my baseline when you can</font>

843
00:34:50,369 --> 00:34:55,250
start seeing things that stick<font color="#CCCCCC"> hey up I</font>

844
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:21,330
think it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> good at all I think</font>

845
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,940
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> key thing there is reasonably</font>

846
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:25,710
resourced so ever I've worked the

847
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:29,640
fortune 50 manufacturing company which

<font color="#E5E5E5">other place I've worked</font>

854
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:47,970
especially Australian based companies

855
00:35:44,190 --> 00:36:03,030
that don't have that resource it's a

856
00:35:47,970 --> 00:36:04,919
best effort I think what it is is it

857
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:07,410
it's the companies that value security

858
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:09,480
and value you know can put a budget<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

859
00:36:07,410 --> 00:36:11,190
security you know and it's not always

00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:12,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">about just the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> IR it's about all the</font>

861
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:14,430
other work that we do operationally to

862
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,290
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to detect that and know that in</font>

863
00:36:14,430 --> 00:36:18,990
the first place you know like<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we</font>

864
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:20,490

865
00:36:18,990 --> 00:36:23,689

866
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:25,799
asset size with a set budget and

867
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:27,870
understanding what security actually

868
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:29,640
means to them you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> your local fish</font>
