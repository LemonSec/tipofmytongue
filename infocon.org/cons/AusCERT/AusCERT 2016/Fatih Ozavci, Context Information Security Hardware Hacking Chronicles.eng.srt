1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,549
and without any<font color="#E5E5E5"> further ado I'm going to</font>

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,990
introduce fat who's going to give his

3
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:10,559
presentation on hardware hacking

4
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:12,150
chronicles IOT hack offense and defense

5
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:19,109
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can all give them a round of</font>

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:22,740
applause thank you is my voice clear for

7
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:27,750
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last lines okay hear me as up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:30,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">good yeah my name is fatty and i'm</font>

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,840
working for context but today i will

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:36,690
talk about hardware hacking the i will

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,079
talk about the devices so if you are

12
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:43,379
coming from a service provider or a sort

13
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,120
of subscriber service presenter do not

14
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:48,539
be offended because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will not talk</font>

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,480
about service providers most of the time

16
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">i will talk about devices and how we can</font>

17
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,279
alter them to attack the services

18
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,718
background which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> back-end services</font>

19
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:04,319
infrastructure or other devices the

20
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,420
second one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i will show some photos</font>

21
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,360
and demos and i will explain some

22
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:13,110
attacks first one is all those devices

23
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,799
are mine my property<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of them from</font>

24
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:18,479
my ex contacts and some of them from

25
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:21,869
ebay and gone three because<font color="#CCCCCC"> i had plenty</font>

26
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:25,110
of times on Christmas<font color="#E5E5E5"> last Christmas I</font>

27
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:28,140
was changing<font color="#CCCCCC"> my job so I had let's say</font>

28
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:30,390
two months vacation it is a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

29
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,880
tech guy so i just opened all the boxes

30
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:35,909
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see some pictures from my</font>

31
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,490
boxes moreover if you are so keen to

32
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:41,640
play with all those tools probably you

33
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:45,030
will need helpers<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about them</font>

34
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:49,290
but i have<font color="#E5E5E5"> almost all of them here only</font>

35
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:52,740
missing ones are RF tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> HDR and the</font>

36
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,990
other tools but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rest are here so if</font>

37
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:59,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">you if you are so keen to talk about it</font>

38
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:04,250
please find me<font color="#E5E5E5"> during lunch and now my</font>

00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:09,270
some unified communications experience

41
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,799
and of course<font color="#CCCCCC"> some network</font>

42
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,590

program so I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> presented almost all</font>

46
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:24,359
the major<font color="#CCCCCC"> events except RSA they don't</font>

47
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:26,280
like me I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know why but the other</font>

48
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,680
tech events including blackhat europe

49
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,410
USA DEFCON hacking<font color="#E5E5E5"> the box also tracks</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">cohen cubicle troopers that's my</font>

51
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:38,430
favorite anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was everywhere to talk</font>

52
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:41,700
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> my favorite topics but today i</font>

53
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:44,340
will talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> some additional topics</font>

54
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:47,250
which are<font color="#CCCCCC"> buyout and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware hacking</font>

55
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:49,680
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i will try to explain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what are the</font>

56
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:52,200
subscriber services and how they use i

57
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,250
owed and i will explain my hardware

58
00:02:52,200 --> 00:03:00,119
hacking chronicles between that two

59
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:02,970
months<font color="#E5E5E5"> period moreover actually I was</font>

60
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:04,590
focusing on some additional services as

61
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:07,590
well but i will talk about only

62
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:10,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">broadband devices and office devices</font>

63
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:13,410
here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> after that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i will also offer</font>

64
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,709
some solutions to the service providers

65
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:21,140
and also penetration testing teams

66
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:24,420
because we need to improve some stuff

67
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:26,850
than we call<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet of things we see</font>

68
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:30,089
too many things actually and they are

69
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:34,590
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> tanked baby monitors just real</font>

70
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:36,450
babies Barbies and etc I don't know yes

71
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,970
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should pay more attention to them but</font>

72
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:41,040
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't care maybe we need a new</font>

73
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:43,620
terminology for them because subscriber

74
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,560
devices are also IOT devices they are

75
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">connected to the net infrastructure or</font>

76
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,470
they are connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a restricted</font>

77
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:55,860
network which I will discuss later and

78
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:58,650
they provide some data from customer to

79
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:01,650
service provider or vice versa so they

80
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:04,260
can be also under some secret to trust

81
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,940
and office devices they are also

82
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:09,420
vulnerable for some heartbreaking

83
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:12,390
attacks 3g 4g modems access points IP

84
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,130
phones keyboard and mouse so they are

85
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:16,709
everywhere so we can use hardware

86
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:19,260
hacking skills to attack almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of</font>

87
00:04:16,709 --> 00:04:22,019
them so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is why we should</font>

88
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:23,539
evolve and in terms of things is

89
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:25,640
changing so we here

90
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:29,840
too many privacy violations regarding

91
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:32,840
all of them but who cares a baby that's

92
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,820
another topic my focus is much more

93
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,830
sensitive devices medical devices are

94
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:40,849
also important but this is again another

95
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:44,210
talk I will talk about broadband devices

96
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:48,110
and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> business devices so I will</font>

97
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:50,930
focus on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the business risk yes consumers</font>

98
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:54,080
are under threat but what about<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

99
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:55,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">business what about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to service providers</font>

100
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,190
because they get money through those

101
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:01,159
services and they have some challenge

102
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:05,030
with those devices so we need to solve

103
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:07,660
them some rooters are under attack all

104
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:12,080
the time and this is not another news

105
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:15,980
moreover some of them also shipped with

106
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:19,219
some official backdoors so when you get

107
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:22,400
a device from a service provider as a

108
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:24,800
part of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> contract you may have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a big</font>

109
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:29,690
door device and everybody's fine with

110
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:32,930
that that is ridiculous moreover some of

111
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:36,890
the devices are well known<font color="#CCCCCC"> cisco linksys</font>

112
00:05:32,930 --> 00:05:39,050
netgear they are all known and some of

113
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:42,860
service providers in<font color="#CCCCCC"> australia also for</font>

114
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:44,990
those devices however in<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. there are</font>

115
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:49,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">some regulations for them and TP link</font>

116
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:51,890
for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> will try to avoid customers</font>

117
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:56,210
to change its firmware so basically

118
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:58,820
dd-wrt open wrt cannot be used on those

119
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:00,950
devices in their perspective this may be

120
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:03,430
possible or not but the discussion is

121
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:06,530
there is a regulation for that because

122
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:09,020
customized software may manipulate the

123
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:12,530
wireless signals and this why there are

124
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:14,510
restrictions and beyond of it there are

125
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:17,840
some privacy violations and there are

126
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:19,940
other regulations in that area and of

127
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,130
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Australia there is a Privacy</font>

128
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:25,280
Commissioner and he can visit any

129
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:29,000
service provider to make things select

130
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:33,200
this series so those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the topics</font>

131
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:35,129
broadband devices IPTV devices some of

132
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:38,550
them are also satellite and broad

133
00:06:35,129 --> 00:06:40,439
devices and last ones are home<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

134
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:42,539
office equipment so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

135
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:45,419
getting those devices through service

136
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:48,058
providers and someone should take the

137
00:06:45,419 --> 00:06:50,609
responsibility right and let's talk

138
00:06:48,059 --> 00:06:53,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">about some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them but before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that our</font>

139
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:59,879
traditional test approach is not

140
00:06:53,580 --> 00:07:02,639
sufficient<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is the first problem and</font>

141
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:05,489
this is our problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am a security</font>

142
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:09,479
tester a security researcher and I know

143
00:07:05,489 --> 00:07:12,688
we are insufficient we are insufficient

144
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:15,209
because we are hired for a limited

145
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:18,809
period we do not combine additional

146
00:07:15,209 --> 00:07:21,659
skills because we are only resources for

147
00:07:18,809 --> 00:07:26,969
the Australian business most of the

148
00:07:21,659 --> 00:07:30,029
project managers use us as a resource so

149
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:34,439
project must start in a day and and in a

150
00:07:30,029 --> 00:07:37,919
day and during the project timeline we

151

152
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:43,859
talk about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> later can you make it that</font>

153
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,979
is the major problem and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's why all</font>

154
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:49,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">those devices are vulnerable here and I</font>

155
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:52,498
<font color="#CCCCCC">will show some of them and actually I</font>

156
00:07:49,649 --> 00:07:55,259
will show the way I will not expose any

157
00:07:52,499 --> 00:07:58,529
specific vulnerability targeting the

158
00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:03,529
service providers but I will show the

159
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:06,959
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> pad and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can look more anyway</font>

160
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:08,819
you'll see but the traditional test also

161
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:11,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not cover the devices because they</font>

162
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:14,369
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not in scope most of the time</font>

163
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:17,749
service providers get tabletop analysis

164
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:20,999
for their design review or the focus on

165
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:24,389
some infrastructure services this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why</font>

166
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:26,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">we get a stone at work pen testing for a</font>

167
00:08:24,389 --> 00:08:30,059
limited<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of IP addresses let's say</font>

168
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:32,279
100 but we are talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about service</font>

169
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:34,769
provider infrastructure those devices

170
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:38,578
are at home and they are getting managed

171
00:08:34,769 --> 00:08:40,948
in a protected<font color="#CCCCCC"> Network aunt we know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

172
00:08:38,578 --> 00:08:43,739
follow of the budget so days are<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

173
00:08:40,948 --> 00:08:46,170
limited this why we<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> develop a</font>

174
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,990
new technology and new test methodology

175
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:52,020
for all embedded devices therefore

176
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:54,649
we need to have a flexible one because

177
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:57,870
we may have multiple devices we may have

178
00:08:54,649 --> 00:09:01,230
arm or MIPS architecture we may have

179
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:03,029
linux or vxworks we may have some older

180
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:06,360
new versions so this must be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

181
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:08,550
flexible also this must focus on the

182
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:12,630
device role because<font color="#E5E5E5"> a broadband modem</font>

183
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:15,270
can be a modem if you want to buy<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

184
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:17,790
there is an office works or another ID

185
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:20,069
shop so you can buy one but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font>

186
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:25,110
one of them through the service provider

187
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:26,520
shops you will get a modem with some

188
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:29,070
additional support from the service

189
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:31,140
provider that modem will have roles for

190
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:34,260
example providing persistent unified

191
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:36,630
communications features moreover it will

192
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:39,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">provide a video-on-demand service for</font>

193
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:43,200
you so it is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a part of business</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> model</font>

194
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:45,480
when you buy<font color="#CCCCCC"> something yourself you will</font>

195
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,550
get a modern there will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be no business</font>

196
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,190
maybe you may have concerns about your

197
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:53,010
privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I'm targeting the business</font>

198
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,720
here so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to improve the</font>

199
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:57,209
business security we need to focus on a

200
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,000
methodology because I will be not the

201
00:09:57,209 --> 00:10:02,250
only security researcher here and i know

202
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">we have too many good guys here and they</font>

203
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:08,250
focus on iOS acute and hardware security

204
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:10,290
so let's find out a methodology and we

205
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:13,920
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow it and we can improve and we</font>

206
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:16,110
can share things and device discovery is

207
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,579
the first step we understand the device

208
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:20,520
we need to understand the attack

209
00:10:17,579 --> 00:10:22,829
surfaces of these device dumping the

210
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,470
firmware of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> device so we can work on</font>

211
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:27,750
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> firmware to find vulnerabilities or</font>

212
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:30,209
maybe some additional attack surfaces

213
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:32,250
and debug the network and moreover we

214
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:34,349
need to fuzz it because some of the

215
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:37,020
vendors do not pay attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

216
00:10:34,350 --> 00:10:39,450
software box and lastly we need to focus

217
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,910
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> exploitation and lastly we need</font>

218
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:45,480
to improve our red teaming exercises we

219
00:10:41,910 --> 00:10:48,750
need to work on the implants<font color="#CCCCCC"> and now I</font>

220
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:53,399
will talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> my days my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chronicles so</font>

221
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:55,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically what i do is so simple and it</font>

222
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:58,760
is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> hidden it is not kind of new</font>

223
00:10:55,470 --> 00:11:01,650
discovery basically i just<font color="#CCCCCC"> downloaded</font>

224
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,339
modems interfaces web management

225
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,559
interface

226
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:07,319
and web management interfaces had

227
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:11,459
limited functionalities so what I did

228
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:14,878
was downloading the configuration or

229
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:18,059
break up it has all the limited features

230
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:21,389
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can edit a backup and you can</font>

231
00:11:18,059 --> 00:11:23,850
reupload it back what you can do is

232
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:25,319
enabling security interfaces for example

233
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:27,569
10 net or secure shell or something like

234
00:11:25,319 --> 00:11:29,660
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can harvest credentials such as</font>

235
00:11:27,569 --> 00:11:32,670
unified communications credentials or

236
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:35,579
you can easily extract some

<font color="#E5E5E5">video-on-demand service licenses they</font>

238
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:41,008
are all they look a part of this device

239
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:43,258
but you cannot reach through the web

240
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:46,019
interfaces you need to download<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

241
00:11:43,259 --> 00:11:49,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">backup the other one is much more</font>

242
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:52,139
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have secret handshakes</font>

243
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,879
if you know the second hand check the

244
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:57,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">Enable lieutenant or secure shell</font>

245
00:11:53,879 --> 00:12:00,180
interface with root access because it is

246
00:11:57,809 --> 00:12:02,430
used there are public exploits for that

247
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:04,489
during<font color="#CCCCCC"> my formal engagements I have</font>

248
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:08,160
developed for because the vendor

249
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:10,139
explained this if you put the device mac

250
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,449
address and hard coded user and password

251
00:12:10,139 --> 00:12:15,839
and if you calculate this<font color="#E5E5E5"> with some</font>

252
00:12:12,449 --> 00:12:17,519
additional values you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> send it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

interface is closed it will be open

255
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:26,910
without any password protection and you

256
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:29,279
will have root access the other one is

257
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:33,199
physical interfaces and all this

258

<font color="#E5E5E5">information available in the net in</font>

00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:42,929
talk about the credentials I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

enabled

276
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:20,240
so you will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have access to the device</font>

277
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:23,060
much more focused and complicated one

00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:25,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">then our next voice for that but they do</font>

282
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:34,670
important here because they are offered

00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:37,550
by Australian service providers here and

284
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:41,209
they are commonly<font color="#CCCCCC"> used for ambien and</font>

00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:49,100
is also used for cable connections the

287
00:13:46,070 --> 00:13:52,070
other one is generic errors we have upnp

288
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:55,670
box DLNA box and etc so they can be

289

301
00:14:23,090 --> 00:14:27,800
one is dumping credentials and etc the

00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:30,170
second one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the console</font>

303
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,900
and exploits they are the modems we use

304
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:35,599
the funniest one is the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> one the</font>

00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,910
modem offered by a service provider if

307
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:43,430
you get the password HTML passport HTML

308
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:47,930
has the administrative password in plain

309

visit the password HTML grab the

311
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:56,120
password and use it that's it so it is

312
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:58,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">really dangerous but I focus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the</font>

313
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:00,910
hardware hacking stuff what we can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

314
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:03,770
those devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are is the interface</font>

315
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:07,130
to get console access or debug access to

316
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:09,530
those devices so you art has TX Rx

317
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:12,800
ground and voltage pins so we are

318
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:15,110
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about four pins but sometimes</font>

319
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,329
renders put another one for security but

320
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:19,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">sometimes they remove voltage so</font>

321
00:15:17,330 --> 00:15:22,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically transmit and receive all the</font>

322
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:25,010
important ones because we will send some

323
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:26,960
data and we will get some data jtag is

324
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:29,260
another one is a debug standard

325
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:32,180
basically manufacturers

326
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:34,189
provide and manufacture thousands of

327
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:36,739
devices and they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to test them this</font>

328
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:40,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">right they use a standard for that and</font>

329
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:43,220
jtag is the answer but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

330
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:46,069
jtag standard is slightly flexible so it

331
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:48,560
depends on the vendors yes<font color="#E5E5E5"> pin pads and</font>

332
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:50,840
connections they are a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit standard but</font>

333
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:54,949
vendor may add additional pimp add

334
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:57,760
additional security on it<font color="#CCCCCC"> spi is another</font>

00:15:54,950 --> 00:16:00,350
way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reach the flash or</font>

336
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:03,260
system-on-chips so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically we can</font>

337
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:06,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">communicate with them directly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

338
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:12,380
those interfaces so why<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how we use</font>

339
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:14,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">it davai is those devices because we</font>

340
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:17,840
love those devices so we need targets I

341
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:20,030
love<font color="#E5E5E5"> bus pirate or bass blaster or jet</font>

343
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:25,670
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good devices they're all here and</font>

344
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:27,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">I need some targets this why I open the</font>

345
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:30,709
boxes that's why<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are playing with</font>

346
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:32,930
them no one hired me to focus on them I

347
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:35,240
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> former</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> engagements focusing on</font>

348
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:38,180
broadband connections and some IPTV

349
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:41,660
systems and another one was<font color="#E5E5E5"> femtocell</font>

350
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:44,719
modems and etc but my focus is hardware

351
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:47,630
hacking but<font color="#E5E5E5"> during an engagement I to do</font>

352
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">this within a limited period it is not</font>

353
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:53,900
always possible even dumping your

354
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,310
firmware will take ages sometimes you

355
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:58,579
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> brute-force the jtag interface</font>

356
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:00,979
to find the right instruction list how

357
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:07,250
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you understand me about taking</font>

358
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:11,990
time yes it will take time so vendors do

359
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:15,500
not pay attention but devices do so

360
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:18,109
those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> my tools</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect system on</font>

361
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:20,060
chip clips or<font color="#CCCCCC"> hydro bus or jet</font>

362
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:23,240
regulators so they are helpers some of

363
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:27,280
the tasks are already automated and they

364
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:30,080
are also well known the other one is<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

365
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:32,720
modem this is a modem offered by a

366
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:35,990
service provider if you look closer you

367
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,330
will see to your connections there and

368
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:42,620
they're already prepared so we need to

369
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:44,360
plug our cables only another one is here

370
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:47,330
and this is coming from another service

371
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:50,330
provider in Australia<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this one had</font>

372
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:54,080
no pain<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually I just soldered four of</font>

373
00:17:50,330 --> 00:17:56,629
them so sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have pin pads</font>

374
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,899
sometimes they have pins so we can use

375
00:17:56,630 --> 00:18:01,910
them so i plug my cables and I connected

376
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:05,270
through my hardware hacking tools this

377
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:09,970
one is a 4g wireless modem of a service

378
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:13,220
provider so when you unplug the battery

379
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:16,340
seal the board you will see the

380
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:18,380
interfaces I mean when I say seal the

381
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:20,720
board it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> justice sticker unstick it</font>

382
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:22,910
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> will see this and geotech</font>

383
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,150
interfaces already written there so what

384
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:28,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">I did is soldering them and putting on</font>

385
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:32,210
jtag you later identifying piatek

386
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:35,050
interface finding<font color="#E5E5E5"> a an ID and starting</font>

387
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:39,290
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> bass blaster to play with it</font>

388
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:40,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">another one is here we focused on the</font>

389
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:43,010
UART interfaces but we are missing

390
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:45,410
something else this is another system on

391
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:48,379
chip I do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what it is what can I</font>

392
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:50,390
do is basically putting a clamp on it a

393
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:52,670
clip so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will connect all</font>

394
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:54,080
the ports actually not the ports their

395
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:57,020
legs it's an electronic<font color="#E5E5E5"> circuit</font>

396
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,970
basically and I connected all of them to

397
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:01,040
my logic<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyzer to understand is there</font>

398
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:03,290
any firmware inside or is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a power</font>

399
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:08,090
controller is an Italian controller what

400
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:10,790
is it so I worked<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> again so if i</font>

401
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:13,459
get a UART connection the four pins in

402
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:16,790
the first place basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will get all</font>

403
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:18,920
those four connections which means i

404
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:23,389
will have an access to boot loader or

405
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:25,429
console access the other one is real

406
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:27,440
time debugging this is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> good if i</font>

407
00:19:25,429 --> 00:19:29,480
plug this and if i will operate some

408
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,610
tasks against the modem the<font color="#CCCCCC"> modem will</font>

409
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:34,309
provide some debugging output to me

410
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:36,439
sometimes it gives me root access

411
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:39,950
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> a password most of the time it</font>

412
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:43,700
adds like that and basically four pins

413
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:45,530
need need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be identified sometimes</font>

414
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:49,130
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty open like in this</font>

415
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:51,170
example 3.3 voltage and grant are in and

416
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:53,929
etc but we need to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ground first</font>

417
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:55,430
grant is easiest one so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use a</font>

418
00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:58,370
multimeter for that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

419
00:19:55,430 --> 00:20:00,380
find the voltage pin again it is also

420
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:02,959
easier you can use another multimeter to

421
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:05,330
measure that when you find the correct

422
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,600
voltage you can set the target voltage

423
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:09,949
using your tool and try to communicate

424
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:13,370
basically you will try to send the data

425
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:15,800
and try to receive a data so transmit

426
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:19,100
and receive must be diverse in your

427
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:23,180
board so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to use your transmit</font>

428
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:25,909
pin to their receive pain so basically

429
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:29,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">it must be like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that if you do this rock</font>

430
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:33,290
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> switch it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so it will work anyway</font>

431
00:20:29,690 --> 00:20:34,760
the problem is speed baud rates so

432
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:38,360
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can brute force it but</font>

433
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:40,370
lucky punch is a 115 200 if you do not

434
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:42,979
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lucky</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> punch you can you jtag</font>

435
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:45,399
later to build force it sometimes it is

436
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:48,320
also encrypted some<font color="#CCCCCC"> vendors use an</font>

437
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,910
embedded digital certificate to encrypt

438
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,189
this data and they've read the kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

439
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:55,040
authentication so basically all the data

440
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:58,010
including the lagoon console encrypted

441
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:00,590
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I had only one example like that the</font>

442
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:05,650
rest are easier you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a regulator</font>

443
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:05,649
to brute force it so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a video and</font>

444
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:14,240
this needs to be playing yes<font color="#CCCCCC"> pooty is</font>

445
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:18,379
the tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> I try to use to jtag later so</font>

446
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:22,700
jtag you later will have pin pads sorry

447
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:26,720
pins to connect<font color="#CCCCCC"> I plug those cables to</font>

448
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:30,230
here and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> will try to brute force them</font>

449
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:33,530
I need to plug the ground to ground and

450
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:35,390
the rest to other pins for the UART you

451
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:37,850
don't need to use but it's a basic demo

452
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:40,910
so you can understand how it<font color="#CCCCCC"> works so</font>

453
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:43,250
starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> channel 0 ending channel is too</font>

454
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:47,510
because I had three cables so it will

455
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:49,190
identify what is it and how jtag later

456
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:53,480
is a brute<font color="#CCCCCC"> force tool it is not a kind</font>

457
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:55,970
of a console access tool or it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

458
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:58,220
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of JJ tag debugger so it will only</font>

459
00:21:55,970 --> 00:22:01,820
brute force it as we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

460
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:05,600
some data and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this data is not</font>

461
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:08,090

462
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,658
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that bad rate to communicate</font>

in

00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:14,570
this example we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will use first and</font>

465
00:22:11,649 --> 00:22:16,488
second pins for transmit and receive and

466
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:18,739
we will set<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ball rate and we will get</font>

471
00:22:24,919 --> 00:22:30,409
characters that's why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to use the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">tool dedicated i suggest bus pirate or</font>

00:22:32,349 --> 00:22:38,149
raising<font color="#E5E5E5"> 50 favorite it has multiple</font>

475
00:22:35,539 --> 00:22:40,190

476
00:22:38,149 --> 00:22:43,129
and it is programmable using<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python and</font>

477
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:47,059
it is its own firmware it may react just

478
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:49,070
like our<font color="#CCCCCC"> other tools anyway if we get</font>

479
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:51,168
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are taxes basically we will get</font>

debugging logging intercepting the boot

481
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:56,149
sequence so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can intercept</font>

482
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:59,539
the CFE<font color="#E5E5E5"> bootloader and we will get</font>

483
00:22:56,149 --> 00:23:01,998
console access or we can do more we will

484
00:22:59,539 --> 00:23:03,889
see this example is on<font color="#CCCCCC"> netgear NephCure</font>

485
00:23:01,999 --> 00:23:07,220
is another modem offered by another

486
00:23:03,889 --> 00:23:12,049
service provider so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is our other</font>

487
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:14,659
demo basically when we find the modem

488
00:23:12,049 --> 00:23:17,090

<font color="#E5E5E5">are the console access and we will plug</font>

490
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:24,139
our cable and we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to get login</font>

491
00:23:19,489 --> 00:23:27,799
and password<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we can try brute</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> force</font>

492
00:23:24,139 --> 00:23:30,799
if it is based on login access but

493
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:33,679
basically we can restart the modem so we

494
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:35,720
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the debug input as well we may</font>

495
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:38,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">have some additional ways to find the</font>

496
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:41,929
root password it is also possible and i

497
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:44,928
will refer it during<font color="#E5E5E5"> spi bambi restart</font>

498
00:23:41,929 --> 00:23:47,119
the modem we will see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going on</font>

499
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:50,119
how it boots<font color="#E5E5E5"> which services are there</font>

500
00:23:47,119 --> 00:23:52,189
and we service<font color="#E5E5E5"> provider is there and how</font>

501
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:56,349
it is getting configured and how it is

502
00:23:52,190 --> 00:24:01,009
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> managed in some of my examples</font>

503
00:23:56,349 --> 00:24:03,349
were TR 69 and doxies but this depends

504
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:05,659
on the device as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see we see the</font>

505
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:08,539
boot access that's all actually this is

506
00:24:05,659 --> 00:24:14,929
a basic boot log of a sort of linux unix

507
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:16,489
version anyway if we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> CFE access we</font>

508
00:24:14,929 --> 00:24:19,149
will have a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of boot loader</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> axis</font>

509
00:24:16,489 --> 00:24:21,900
which means we may have some additional

510
00:24:19,149 --> 00:24:24,270
options reflashing the

511
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:26,280
modem changing it with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> customized</font>

512
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:27,570
firmware or we can overwrite the

513
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,460
information or we can harvest<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

514
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:31,919
credentials or we can extract the data

515
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:34,320
to the CF interface it also<font color="#E5E5E5"> supports</font>

516
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:37,380
sometimes dumping the firmware using a

517
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:40,710
TFT a tftp server so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

518
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:43,800
tftp server and you can ask it to upload

519
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:45,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the firmware to that tftp server or</font>

520
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:48,510
vice versa you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can put a customized</font>

521
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:52,260
firmware to your tftp to try to deploy

522
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:54,379
it so another example is based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> satin</font>

523
00:24:52,260 --> 00:25:00,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">chrome this is also another modem</font>

524
00:24:54,380 --> 00:25:00,530
offered by a service provider sorry

525
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:08,880
would you play the<font color="#E5E5E5"> video there is no</font>

526
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:11,129
event for that<font color="#CCCCCC"> one please thank you yes</font>

527
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,200
when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> bought the device we will see</font>

528
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:15,120
the CFE interface when we hit the button

529
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:18,870
we will see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CF interactive interface</font>

530
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:21,090
so we may have options see if it seems

531
00:25:18,870 --> 00:25:23,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">like a standard but it is not vendors</font>

532
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:25,980
may add some additional options in this

533
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:30,060
case changing the board or reflashing it

534
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:33,660
or erasing<font color="#E5E5E5"> ananda flash there are all</font>

535
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:35,850
other options<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we may have some</font>

536
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:38,970
additional options uart is the first way

537
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:40,620
yes but we may have<font color="#CCCCCC"> jtag standards it's</font>

538
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:43,710
a debugging standard so basically

539
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:45,780
everything depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the vendor Vander</font>

540
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:49,370
may add new pins or vendor may add

541
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:52,860
additional layers so the daisy chain<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

542
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:55,979
defined as a standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> input/output clock</font>

543
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:57,899
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> mode select they are there but van</font>

544
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:01,740
der may have some additional devices

545
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:04,110
connected to actually on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> board so</font>

546
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:06,570
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> modern board or the active device</font>

547
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:10,860
may have multiple<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPUs multiple system</font>

548
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:13,860
own chips and multiple active devices so

549
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:18,050
we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use this daisy chain to send data</font>

550
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:20,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">and get output from every one of them</font>

551
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:23,010
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> identify those jtag</font>

552
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:25,350
pins<font color="#E5E5E5"> bambi give us a closer look we will</font>

553
00:26:23,010 --> 00:26:28,110
see them sometimes they are labeled but

554
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:30,270
most of the time they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not if we are</font>

555
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:32,490
working on them we may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have some</font>

556
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:34,379
difficulties in my example<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need to</font>

557
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,910
keep the battery all the time because

558
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,890
the device must<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

559
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:41,640
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> power source and it was battery</font>

560
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:43,800
based device so I needed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to catch it</font>

561
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:47,820
like that so in my jtag later demo

562
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:53,010
basically i will use another brute force

563
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:55,080
for jtag it is another feature of jtag

564
00:26:53,010 --> 00:26:57,960
later and it can discover the jtech

565
00:26:55,080 --> 00:27:00,480
interfaces if we use ID code scan ID

566
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:04,050
code scan will identify the pins but it

567
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:06,240
will not easily find the input pin so

568
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:09,389
basically we may need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put some</font>

569
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:11,790
additional scans so what we try to do is

570
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:15,720
identifying all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pins if you identify</font>

571
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:19,020
the pins we may identify the devices

572
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:22,320
connected to that chain there is a chain

573
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:26,000
so basically we may find three or four

574
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:30,480
or maybe five active devices on that

575
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:33,990
modem or consumer device as we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

576
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:38,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">jet regulators will forcing it so our</font>

577
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:40,500

00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:43,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need to use yet regulator for that</font>

579
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:45,480
you may use<font color="#CCCCCC"> but spider</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hydro bus for</font>

580
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:47,610

581
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:51,800
perform automated brute force attacks

584
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:05,159
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do with that bypass scan listed the</font>

585
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:07,920
pins so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use those pins to sound</font>

586
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:11,610
test communication how many devices are

587
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:14,430
connected what is the vendor ID test the

588
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:16,320
daisy chain works are not send an input

589
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:19,410
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait for the output they match it or</font>

590
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:22,260
not because the chain may have issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

591
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:25,410
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> have issues maybe pins are wrong so</font>

592
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:29,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">I operated some test operations in this</font>

593
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:31,890
list we see the components connected so

594
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:35,250
manufacturer IDs are there we will use

595
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:36,810
them so basically when be sent a test

596
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:40,170
request we<font color="#CCCCCC"> will see the daisy chain</font>

597
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:42,300
verse but those varieties are also

598
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:44,550
important starting from that moment we

599
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:47,220
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> use bus cluster and a software</font>

600
00:28:44,550 --> 00:28:49,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">let's say open</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> LCD or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you are jtag to</font>

601
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,920
brute force that<font color="#CCCCCC"> J</font>

602
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:54,939
comas because they are<font color="#CCCCCC"> test commands</font>

603
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:57,100
right so we need to use them if we use

604
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:59,440
that we can easily dump a device memory

605
00:28:57,100 --> 00:29:02,678
or we can dump a firmware we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

606
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,590
the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> way use spi spi is direct</font>

607
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:06,730
communication with the flash or

608
00:29:04,590 --> 00:29:08,949
system-on-chips they may have multiple

609
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:12,330
legs sometimes eight sometimes four

610
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:16,390
sometimes 16 sometimes we have clamps

611
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:19,360
anyway we can use them to dump the

612
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:21,340
question is why we do this service

613
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:24,549
providers have those devices broadband

614
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:26,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">IPTV and satellite and devices are</font>

615
00:29:24,549 --> 00:29:28,720
connected to their infrastructure and

616
00:29:26,350 --> 00:29:32,379
they are under management of TR 69 or

617
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:34,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">docsis or in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> consumer premises are</font>

618
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:37,480
relying on vendor security is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

619
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:42,010
sufficient<font color="#E5E5E5"> and many service providers do</font>

620
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:45,610
this rely<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the vendors so what we can</font>

621
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:47,830
do is basically altering the devices yes

622
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:53,350
but let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> real-life attack</font>

623
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:55,750
right first of all many vendors are in

624
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:57,219
that pool so device provisioning is

625
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:59,260
important and they have software

626
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:01,000
configuration management as well so they

627
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:03,129
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put some operations on it</font>

628
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:06,360
moreover call<font color="#CCCCCC"> center connections they</font>

629
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:09,960
are also there because the subscriber

630
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:12,370
need some support for those devices

631
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,850
genetic information in the vault can be

632
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:17,860
used for that open wrt and<font color="#CCCCCC"> dd-wrt</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

633
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:19,360
open source communities and they list

634
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:22,178
all the genetic<font color="#E5E5E5"> instructions of</font>

635
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:26,020
broadband modems or your<font color="#E5E5E5"> video on demand</font>

636
00:30:22,179 --> 00:30:28,090
devices<font color="#CCCCCC"> stps and IPTV boxes so basically</font>

637
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:31,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can use them or you can use</font>

638
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:34,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">bypassing controls they are all</font>

639
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,240
available everywhere and bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

640
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:39,820
device is another challenge with and in

641
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,710
this case we<font color="#CCCCCC"> may have a modem modem will</font>

642
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:43,600
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a provisioning pool one of them</font>

643
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:46,690
may be provisioned the second one may

644
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,928
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> and third varme different provision</font>

645
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:52,660
is based on a protocol TR 69 is one of

646
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:55,179
them if we sit right TR 16 and we will

647
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:56,919
see of the configuration server some

648
00:30:55,179 --> 00:30:59,470
cheap services supporting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UC</font>

650
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:03,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">some modems will not be provisioned</font>

651
00:31:01,419 --> 00:31:04,779
maybe they are not register

652
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:08,408
but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other ones will be bring your</font>

653
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:10,389

654
00:31:08,409 --> 00:31:12,610
the infrastructure again if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we alter a</font>

00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:17,939
other devices we can attack the device

657
00:31:15,399 --> 00:31:20,649
is in the same pool or we can attack the

658
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:22,210
services not available<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> world but</font>

00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,889
devices or services we may have access

662
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:32,590
to the call center because call<font color="#E5E5E5"> center</font>

664
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:39,220
you send a fake modem ID or some data

665
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:41,649
you can manipulate the TR 69 software

666

and TR 69 software is also used by

right now you are not you are plugging

<font color="#E5E5E5">more dangerous access to the service</font>

00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:27,280
providers assume that you cannot alter

708
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:30,309
the modem so basically their voice over

709
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:33,129
IP infrastructure is secure I'm saying

710
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:34,870
this because I have too many unified

711
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:39,270
communications projects and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">performing this day by day basically</font>

713
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:44,020
anyway let's talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other one</font>

714
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:45,850
femtocell devices there are also devices

00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:47,740
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're a replacement of a way</font>

716
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:50,049
station if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no base station</font>

717
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:53,049
there is no<font color="#E5E5E5"> GSM signal there are</font>

718
00:33:50,049 --> 00:33:57,340
alternatives so you can get one<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a</font>

719
00:33:53,049 --> 00:34:00,160
service provider fortunately they ended

720
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:03,250
terminated<font color="#E5E5E5"> this service about March so</font>

721
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:05,020
we had to service providers in Australia

722
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:07,510
and they just terminated those services

723
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:10,540
I bought two<font color="#CCCCCC"> femto devices through</font>

724
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:15,129
gumtree and one for each<font color="#E5E5E5"> service</font>

725
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:17,290
provider I just altered them and just

726
00:34:15,129 --> 00:34:20,469
they are there and one of my former

727
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:22,239
engagements had similar configuration as

728
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:25,658
well and they use similar configuration

729
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:29,319
because the vendor is almost same so

730
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:32,350
what we do is analyzing them yes but

731
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:34,540
what if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information they are</font>

732
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:37,989
connected<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the background</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back end</font>

733
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:40,389
services<font color="#E5E5E5"> using IPSec VPN and if we</font>

734
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:42,939
change them again we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will have TR 69 as</font>

735
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:45,820
an attack surface and we can also attack

736
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:47,950
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> background so just a sec we are</font>

737
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:50,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">saying TR 16 and all the time basically</font>

738
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:52,060
all those devices connected to the auto

739
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:54,158
configuration servers running in the

740
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:56,799
service provider network so service

741
00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:00,990
provider network also puts some

742
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:03,700
additional data so our devices modem

743
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:05,740
devices have a service running on

744
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:07,810
themselves and service provider has

745
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:10,390
another one so they communicate when

746
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:12,670
they need service so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a kind of</font>

747
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:14,350
two-way communications if you alter a

748
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:16,960
modem you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be the man</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the middle</font>

749
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:18,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can modify the original content so</font>

750
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,460
what you can do is basically debugging

751
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:22,750
the protocol gathering information

752
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:25,270
extracting or harvesting everything or

753
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:27,400
maybe manipulating them to attack server

754
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:29,770
service network or class connected

755
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:32,830
moreover we can't dump

756
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:35,950
credentials firmware everything so

757
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:38,860
devices may be dumped some of them drm

758
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:42,009
keys in the turkeys credentials they may

759
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:44,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">be really relevant and don't for device</font>

760
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:46,930
firmware is another way to work on

761
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:49,060
filter exploit development features

762
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:50,620
driving a consumer devices another

763
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:53,140
goodie because we can also manipulate

764
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:55,569
the building features or we can bypass

765
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:59,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">and security controls we can provide a</font>

768
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:06,670

them expensive to replicate the attack

771
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:15,610
because vectors vector in using implant

it is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> easy red teaming engagements</font>

773
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:21,070
need them because we we are evolving

774
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:24,700
because there are now a part of our

engagement and human factor<font color="#CCCCCC"> pan testing</font>

776
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:29,379
they should also evolve we have to

00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:32,220
change<font color="#CCCCCC"> the devices having to send them</font>

778

783
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:47,620
if we use the advanced attacks there are

784
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:49,390
a few the first one is kc b / you can

785

787
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:58,540
for spare your keyboard or mouse with

788
00:36:53,980 --> 00:37:01,120
another computers receiver so basically

789
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:03,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can easily for spare things to get</font>

790
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:05,859
additional access so they are there but

791
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:09,310
hardware implants are expensive if you

792
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:13,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to work on it you may need a time</font>

and when Bambi's soldier those pins we

808
00:37:54,740 --> 00:38:00,350
can easily patch a cable and that cable

809
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:02,300
can also provide connectivity to the

817
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:24,350
should we solve the problem in forging

818
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,930
vendors to disable things such as

819
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:30,650
physical interfaces or using encryption

820
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:32,509
they should start using encryption and

821
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:34,640
we should talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> strong encryption</font>

822
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:36,890
letter they have no encryption almost

825
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:44,660
another good topic yesterday about iOS

826
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:48,260
AQ 2 ratings and maybe we should follow

827
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:50,210
that path for that and network isolation

828
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:51,920
for subscribers it is also important

829
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:54,140
because this may be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> provisioning</font>

830
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,450
network or maybe a kind of restricted

management<font color="#CCCCCC"> network and tailored research</font>

832
00:38:56,450 --> 00:39:01,430
is another answer for the service

833
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:03,440
providers because they need purple team

834
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:05,569
they need some response capabilities and

835
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:08,150
redeeming capabilities to understand the

836
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:09,800
infrastructure identifying the existing

837
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:13,820
trust and anomalies and after that

838
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:16,760
starting testing of these features<font color="#E5E5E5"> such</font>

839
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:20,480
as devices or protocols so they are all

00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:22,970
connected morale work as a security

841
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:25,010
tester we need to evolve we need to put

842
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:26,750
all devices in scope now they are not

for them and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> tailored research</font>

852
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:51,590
is an answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> for both sides and I</font>

853
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:53,870
suggest this to focus on all components

854
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:56,180
focus on every devices and focus on

855
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:59,118
exploitable issues not to

856
00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:01,098
let's say dangers rc4 implementations

857
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,050
yes they are security issues but they

858
00:40:01,099 --> 00:40:06,109
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are real life attacks and they</font>

859
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:08,359
focus on exploitation and there are

860
00:40:06,109 --> 00:40:10,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">really bad vulnerabilities on those</font>

861
00:40:08,359 --> 00:40:12,380
devices and they are exploitable and

862
00:40:10,099 --> 00:40:14,900
they may lead to full compromise of

863
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:17,630
service provider network combining

864
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:19,250
various skills and disciplines it is

865
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:21,349
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> required because they are embedded</font>

866
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:23,359
devices they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be integrated to a</font>

mobile background or infrastructure

868

00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,870
we've got a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of quick questions</font>

879
00:40:56,230 --> 00:41:01,420
one was already pertaining<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the TR</font>

880
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:03,100
6009 protocol so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I might skip that just</font>

881
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:05,080
before<font color="#E5E5E5"> we break for lunch but yeah what</font>

882
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:06,520
modem or router brand would you

883
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:10,720
recommend to be more secure than others

884
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:12,880
excluding pfsense and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ah it may be also</font>

885
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,970
what router brands<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you recommend that</font>

886
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:20,770
were more open wrt dd-wrt kind of

887
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:23,640
compatible<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok in my point in my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point of</font>

888
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:28,030
view some vendors have solutions and

889
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:29,830
they ship their products with different

890
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:31,960
firmwares sometimes they provide a

891
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:34,090
secure firm bed as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well but they do not</font>

892
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,610
contact other service providers to fix

893
00:41:34,090 --> 00:41:39,250
it so basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the kind of Bombay</font>

894
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:41,410
direction they evolve<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they do not</font>

895
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:45,640
fixed all the products so if a service

896
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:47,710
provider asks an older product line they

897
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:50,500
just ship all of them with old firmware

898
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:52,600
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think they can all make it secure</font>

899
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:54,550
there is no difference between the

900
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:56,770
vendors in this stage actually there is

901
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:59,200
no major difference between<font color="#CCCCCC"> the service</font>

902
00:41:56,770 --> 00:42:01,480
providers but they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to pay more</font>

903
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,779
attention to the product itself that is

904
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:08,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">the major difference I think the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> embrace</font>

905
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:10,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">of where is the second step well break</font>

906
