1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,839
it's my my pleasure to introduce Lafe

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,300
alcohol did I get that right not too bad

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:11,160
okay late is the co-founder and senior

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,679
director of advanced intelligence at

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,330
flashpoint which is a business risk

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,090
intelligence company based out of New

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,920
York he heads flashpoints advanced and

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,448
customized intelligence solutions for a

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,400
range of government and commercial

10
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,730
clients which focuses on understanding

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,229
risk posed by terrorists and cyber crime

12
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:31,019
threat actors

13
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:34,489
please welcome life to the stage thank

14
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:37,920
you so much thank you thank you everyone

15
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:41,430
thank you for coming for my talk I'd

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,489
like this to be more informal and so

17
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:47,460
feel free to interrupt me at any time

18
00:00:43,489 --> 00:00:50,339
there might be a lot of data points to

19
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,760
discuss and if I don't make sense at any

20
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:56,180
point please keep me honest a little bit

21
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,980
about my background my Beckham is in

22
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:01,649
counterterrorism at counter intelligence

23
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:03,870
I start early on trying to understand

24
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,430
how threat actors supportive of

25
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,130
terrorist groups as well as terrorist

26
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:11,070
groups themselves how they operate in

27
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:15,420
the cyber domain that goes back to the

28
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:18,149
days of post 9/11 early on we realized

29
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:20,430
that threat actors we're gathering in

30
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:24,119
environments that were closed to the

31
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:27,180
public protected varied environments

32
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,740
behind password-protected walls and they

33
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,189
were proliferating there where they were

34
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,350
sharing

35
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,048
tactics techniques and procedures they

36
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:37,520
were networking trying to raise funds

37
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:40,290
for terrorist activities now most

38
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,090
governments and enterprise companies

39
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,460
were completely unaware of what was

40
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:46,229
going on but that kind of threat

41
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,789
activity was causing damage on the

42
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,920
grounds because these individuals were

43
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:54,149
networking and then finally going from

44
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:56,969
the cyber realm to the battlefield and

45
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:59,909
so if law enforcement intelligence

46
00:01:56,969 --> 00:02:01,020
agencies we're aware of these

47
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:03,149
environments they would have been able

48
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,298
to take proper action in a more

49
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:09,780
proactive manner now why is that

50
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:12,360
relevant to security at large well first

51
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:13,950
of all because I would say cyber

52
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,400
security or cyber threat intelligence

53
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:19,709
at large has always been reactive a

54
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,940
threat actors the something an attack or

55
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:25,500
a breach we react to it we patch systems

56
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:28,680
and then we wait for the next incident

57
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:31,709
so we can respond to it well that's the

58
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:34,110
nd and all we need incident response but

59
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:35,459
would if we're always responsive without

60
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:37,920
being proactive

61
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:41,340
then we're expanding and exhausting

62
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,879
resources and that's that's not good

63
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:47,180
because it's going to take a toll on us

64
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:51,078
now as cyber threat actors and criminals

65
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:53,790
are becoming smarter and more brazen

66
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:55,799
they're innovating ways by looking at

67
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:57,720
the security landscape and they're

68
00:02:55,799 --> 00:03:00,480
saying okay I can see a vulnerability

69
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:04,650
here I can see a gap here so I can take

70
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:08,849
advantage of that so being proactive a

71
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:11,579
as a threat hunter becomes crucial to

72
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:13,589
government entities to companies at

73
00:03:11,579 --> 00:03:16,610
large to understand the threat before it

74
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:19,260
reaches your door and so the premise of

75
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:25,760
business risk intelligence is to be

76
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:29,340
proactive in understanding the threat so

77
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:31,920
by having this kind of business risk

78
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:34,319
intelligence model you're able to

79
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,040
empower units across multiple

80
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,290
organizations to have a decision

81
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,400
advantage and that's really crucial

82
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,200
because we always need a decision

83
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,920
advantage when we're dealing with any

84
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,858
kind of adversarial threat the premise

85
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:54,958
here is that this threat activity is not

86
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:58,650
taking place in very you know if the

87
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,530
cyber space environment is massive but

88
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,730
it's also there are multiple watchdogs

89
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:05,370
who are looking at these threat

90
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:09,569
activities whether it's social media or

91
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:12,780
blogs or other places but because threat

92
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:15,089
actors need both to create an audience

93
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,310
and have a follower base but also they

94
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:19,858
need to protect themselves against the

95
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:21,238
watchdog's of government they need to

96
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:24,180
confine themselves in areas that are

97
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:26,280
very difficult to reach areas like the

98
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,450
deep and dark web encrypted chat

99
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,239
environments and message

100
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:31,229
boards so early on we realize that when

101
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,940
they are proliferating in these

102
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,260
environments we need to be embedded in

103
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:36,180
these environments to understand the

104
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:40,039
threat directly from the source before

105
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:44,100
we get it from a second you know hand

106
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:46,620
source we don't need a journalist to

107
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:50,700
report on it we'd like to understand it

108
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:53,520
directly from the source it's a it's an

109
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:56,870
area where there is something called

110
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,849
peer pressure and peer support the very

111
00:04:56,870 --> 00:05:01,800
individuals who are supporting you and

112
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:03,570
your threat activity are the very

113
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:08,400
individuals who are so pressuring you to

114
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:10,800
conduct terrorist attacks or cyber

115
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,109
attacks and so on so having this kind of

116
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,030
visibility into these threats and the

117
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:16,530
actors behind them their tactics

118
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:17,880
techniques and procedures becomes

119
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:21,169
absolutely critical to any

120
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,760
decision-making in the security business

121
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:26,580
you probably heard the the terms that

122
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:29,969
you know the deep and dark web and how

123
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,380
it's an environment where a lot of

124
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:33,630
threat actors are operating from

125
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:37,080
terrorists to cyber criminals to hackers

126
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,760
and hacktivists to insider threat actors

127
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,870
who are within organizations trying to

128
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:45,599
do harm to their own employers and so on

129
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:47,730
when we compare that to the what we know

130
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,570
as the surface web or the open web this

131
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:53,670
is the indexed environment search

132
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:55,349
engines like Google Bing and others are

133
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:58,080
able to index these environments and

134
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,610
they're become searchable

135
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,490
well threat actors don't like that

136
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:04,530
they'd like to be they'd like to bypass

137
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:07,110
the scrutiny so they can find themselves

138
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:10,229
in these areas that are not indexed by

139
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:12,920
search engines areas that are confined

140
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:15,390
and behind password-protected walls

141
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,740
vetted environments where in order for

142
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,880
you to become a member of these

143
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,890
environments you need to go through a

144
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,969
vetting process that allows you to

145
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:26,330
become member so we are essentially

146
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:29,760
undercover agents in the cyber domain

147
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:32,340
embedding ourselves essentially cyber

148
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:34,289
rubbing shoulders with the threat actors

149
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,659
themselves so we can understand what

150
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:38,190
they're all about

151
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:41,040
when we look at the surface web you look

152
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:43,550
just as an example Facebook

153
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:47,340
there I think right now over two billion

154
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:49,230
Facebook accounts well that's that's a

155
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,289
lot of data but it has very little

156
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:53,670
context how do you sit between all of

157
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:57,480
this data to understand where threat

158
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:59,910
activity is emanating from and who are

159
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:01,590
the threat actors behind them and when

160
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,860
we look at the the deep and dark or the

161
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:06,450
illicit deep and dark web environments

162
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:08,520
it what we call its signal rich

163
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:11,520
environment it's because when you are in

164
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:14,099
Dec in that criminal underground most

165
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,930
people there are not observers these are

166
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,300
hardline individuals who would like to

167
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:20,550
actually take action they're behind the

168
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:23,490
game whether it's an ideological gain or

169
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:26,670
a financial gain or even just to boast

170
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:30,630
their achievements and taunt governments

171
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:32,750
and point out their weaknesses so when

172
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:35,219
we look at the the deep and dark web

173
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:37,530
that the threat actors who are

174
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:40,980
communicating with each other networking

175
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:44,429
and so on that becomes the difference

176
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:47,340
between looking at trying to find one

177
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:49,470
needle in multiple haystacks that's the

178
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:51,390
open web or we look at the deep and dark

179
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:53,550
web it's finding multiple needles in

180
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:57,150
every haystack that you're investigating

181
00:07:53,550 --> 00:08:01,500
as an example if you look at cyber

182
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:04,260
criminals and dark web marketplaces or

183
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,610
or black markets these are individuals

184
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,770
who are not just observing they're

185
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:10,080
trying to sell illicit products and

186
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:15,710
services like databases or fraudulent

187
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:20,310
documents or fake currency and others so

188
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:23,760
the harder to obtain intelligence the

189
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:29,010
more important it becomes I hope this

190
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:31,080
makes sense any questions so far okay so

191
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:34,740
if I want to move on I mentioned how

192
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,329
traditional CGI is reactive but it's

193
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,130
also confined only to cyber threat

194
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:41,330
intelligence and network security just

195
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:45,750
you know which is absolutely important

196
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:47,670
but we don't want to just look at threat

197
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:48,750
we want to look at risk threat is only

198
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:51,479
one part of risk

199
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:53,450
so at flashpoint we'd like to look at

200
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,570
the third activity that involve also

201
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,030
things

202
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:58,860
fraud affecting financial institutions

203
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:02,400
at large affecting organizations that

204
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,840
deal with money at large corporate and

205
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,689
physical security becomes absolutely

206
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,200
crucial because this is not only about

207
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:11,880
cyber attacks this is about

208
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,280
ideologically influenced actors who'd

209
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,720
like to cause physical damage but of

210
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,180
course they have to have a cyber domain

211
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,220
in order to proliferate network and so

212
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,109
on and also insider threat which I just

213
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:24,180
mentioned individuals within

214
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,870
organizations who are wittingly or

215
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,770
unwittingly leaking databases or

216
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:34,140
exposing the network of their own

217
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:37,050
organizations so this is a little skewed

218
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:39,330
because we had to change the format but

219
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:43,079
what I like what I the the term I coined

220
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:46,110
the intelligence trifecta is trying to

221
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:48,030
understand the source of a of the

222
00:09:46,110 --> 00:09:50,460
information trying to understand the

223
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:53,430
actor behind that information and then

224
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:55,110
adding context to understand what is it

225
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:57,449
all about essentially the so what

226
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,800
question or the why question to answer

227
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:01,320
that becomes really critical to

228
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,079
understand the threat so if you're

229
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:05,180
missing any of these points then you

230
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,700
don't have the full picture

231
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:10,770
well in the environments that we monitor

232
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:14,760
we look at the source of information how

233
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:16,920
reliable is this source the information

234
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:20,040
released there is it legitimate can we

235
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:22,319
take action is it meaningful enough that

236
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:24,599
enables you to protect your own systems

237
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:28,710
and your own constituents and your own

238
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,720
employees and clients the context is so

239
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,310
crucial it's not just about attribution

240
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,850
because it's very difficult many times

241
00:10:32,310 --> 00:10:38,400
to do attribution but answering the so

242
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:40,560
what question is all about long term

243
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,060
decision making if you are able to

244
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,310
understand the tactics techniques and

245
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:47,069
procedures used today and potentially

246
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,930
what they could be using tomorrow then

247
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:51,720
you're not behind the curve anymore

248
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:54,060
you're walking along alongside the

249
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:57,530
threat actors who want to do damage I

250
00:10:54,060 --> 00:11:00,239
always say that you know our our

251
00:10:57,530 --> 00:11:04,620
advancement in cybersecurity or in

252
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:07,290
security field at large is not done by

253
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,339
security specialists where we're not the

254
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:09,629
ones who are actually a

255
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:12,749
dancing of our own understanding of

256
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:15,240
security it's the bad guys it's the

257
00:11:12,749 --> 00:11:17,040
criminals who are advancing our

258
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:19,920
understanding of cybersecurity they look

259
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,660
at the security landscape and they find

260
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:25,529
the vulnerabilities and they attack and

261
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:27,420
then we react and so on so we are

262
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:29,639
advancing our learning curve because of

263
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:32,309
what they are doing so if we're able to

264
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:36,139
think like them and walk along their

265
00:11:32,309 --> 00:11:42,509
side then we could potentially and

266
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:43,980
dissipate the next step so one of the

267
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:46,649
cases I mentioned is insider threat so I

268
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:49,550
would like to dig deeper into this topic

269
00:11:46,649 --> 00:11:51,089
so why do we need to pay attention to it

270
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:53,459
well

271
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:55,459
insiders are you could potentially find

272
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:58,529
them in almost every organization

273
00:11:55,459 --> 00:12:01,888
financial sector corporations at large

274
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:04,279
telecom even government individuals who

275
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:07,740
might be unhappy with their employer

276
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:10,620
individuals who would like to in illicit

277
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:14,129
ways make a financial gain because of

278
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,480
their where they're employed these

279
00:12:14,129 --> 00:12:17,040
insiders like to network with

280
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,230
like-minded individuals because they're

281
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,579
able to have a win-win situation you

282
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:23,220
know I scratch your back you scratch

283
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:26,008
mine if you're able to provide me with

284
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:29,040
data basis from this organization then I

285
00:12:26,009 --> 00:12:31,339
can provide you with a with an access to

286
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:35,189
money drops or cash outs from my bank

287
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:36,449
and it affects a range of industries we

288
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:39,779
talked about the financial sector but

289
00:12:36,449 --> 00:12:43,649
also retail sector stock market telecom

290
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:48,870
and others it's becoming one of the

291
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:52,620
biggest threat factors inside these

292
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:53,850
organizations and the individuals who

293
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:56,910
are intentionally leaking this

294
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:58,589
information or selling information those

295
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,839
are after a specific game but they're

296
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:02,970
also the insiders who are unintentional

297
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:04,980
or unwitting participants it's because

298
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,449
they're not protecting themselves when

299
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,639
they're accessing certain areas of the

300
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:12,719
internet they're exposing the network of

301
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:15,540
their own employers by not obfuscating

302
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:19,379
or using a variety of ways like proxies

303
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:21,990
or VPNs or others and so the security

304
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:22,350
forward admins of illicit environments

305
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,570
are

306
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:25,920
to take advantage of that and conduct

307
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,960
attacks when you're not protecting

308
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,349
yourself so there are a variety of ways

309
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:33,360
to look at insider threat so as a simple

310
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:35,130
use case when we look at the

311
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,080
environments that we are monitoring

312
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:38,760
these are very difficult to enter

313
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:40,740
environments you have to almost think

314
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:44,460
like a criminal to become part of the

315
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:46,260
criminal underground so some of the

316
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,630
findings and these this is just you know

317
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:53,850
scratching the surface there are

318
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:56,670
thousands of insiders who are that we

319
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:58,500
are monitoring today as an example a

320
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:01,110
Bank insider somebody who's looking for

321
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:06,210
insiders at a specific Bank like this

322
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:07,770
individual I'm looking for more Bank

323
00:14:06,210 --> 00:14:09,720
insiders to work with I have a couple

324
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:12,300
but I need more he's trying to expand

325
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:14,790
his field when he's able to get an

326
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:17,370
interested party they're taking their

327
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:21,959
communication and encrypted outside

328
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:24,690
channels they're able to they're able to

329
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,940
essentially make a deal and say you know

330
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:28,890
I'm willing to offer you what your what

331
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,910
your what you want and you're able to

332
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:32,970
offer me what I want

333
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:34,920
so let's talk on ICQ or let's talk in

334
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,720
you know over jabber account or

335
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,329
something like that

336
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,420
so understanding the tactics techniques

337
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:45,210
and procedures those insiders are are

338
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:48,349
using becomes again really critical to

339
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:51,240
understand the threat landscape

340
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:54,500
similarly you can have insiders who are

341
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:57,180
kind of conducting social engineering so

342
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,410
somebody who's you know saying I need

343
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,900
someone brilliant with social

344
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:02,610
engineering to carry out reverse Sox

345
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,800
connection to I use specific US

346
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:08,160
corporation so essentially you need to

347
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,510
be on the inside of that corporation so

348
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,920
when they take that conversation outside

349
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:12,030
you say which corporation are you

350
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,180
looking for I'm looking for this

351
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:17,730
corporation do you know an insider there

352
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:20,609
yes I do how much money does he want

353
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:23,640
what can he do for us and so on and so

354
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:26,010
forth so all of this threat activity is

355
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,439
taking place in a variety of places from

356
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:30,090
deep and dark web forums to encrypted

357
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,770
chat services like telegram to

358
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:35,459
unencrypted chat services like this

359
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:39,779
court to even mess

360
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:43,618
boards so the the it's a it's a very

361
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:46,319
expansive environment another one of

362
00:15:43,619 --> 00:15:48,949
those use cases is fraud its massive

363
00:15:46,319 --> 00:15:52,679
it's a multi-billion dollar industry

364
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:54,839
illicit fraud we're talking about not

365
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:56,939
only black markets we're not only

366
00:15:54,839 --> 00:16:00,629
talking about financially motivated

367
00:15:56,939 --> 00:16:02,309
hackers but also we're looking at black

368
00:16:00,629 --> 00:16:07,019
markets that are specifically dedicated

369
00:16:02,309 --> 00:16:09,809
to selling fraudulent credit cards so

370
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:12,869
currently we monitor dozens of them if

371
00:16:09,809 --> 00:16:15,809
we take the top seven of them just the

372
00:16:12,869 --> 00:16:18,569
top seven today over the past thirty

373
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:22,379
days they have released over five

374
00:16:18,569 --> 00:16:25,589
million leaked credit cards the month

375
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:29,610
before that it was ten million the month

376
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:30,929
before that it was 18 million affecting

377
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:33,240
of course countries all around the world

378
00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:35,369
the United States being the number one

379
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,069
target but also here in asia-pacific

380
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:42,089
it's a it's a massive target for

381
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:45,089
fraudsters so they come up with

382
00:16:42,089 --> 00:16:47,399
proprietary schemes for credit card

383
00:16:45,089 --> 00:16:50,639
dumps I mentioned cash outs and money

384
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:52,829
drops and financial institutions coming

385
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,600
up with web injects to steal data and

386
00:16:52,829 --> 00:16:56,849
then you know try to translate that into

387
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:59,790
financial fraud it's widely available

388
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:03,529
and it essentially creates a kind of a

389
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:06,599
fusion center environment to prey on

390
00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:07,829
uninformed individuals and even a you

391
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:11,428
know massive enterprise companies

392
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:12,990
because you know I've I've done worked

393
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:14,909
with a lot of different governments and

394
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:18,449
a lot of different private sector

395
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:20,730
entities and they could be a multi

396
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:22,319
million multi-billion dollar company and

397
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:24,270
they could be one of the most advanced

398
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,648
government agencies in the world but if

399
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:28,649
they don't have access to these

400
00:17:25,648 --> 00:17:30,629
environments if they're just unaware of

401
00:17:28,649 --> 00:17:34,199
what's going on there then they're just

402
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:36,090
missing and that is an advantage for the

403
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:39,330
cyber criminals that's an advantage for

404
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:41,639
the fraudsters fraud it's interesting

405
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:43,289
fraudsters this is their full-time job

406
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:46,440
many times they work more hours than I

407
00:17:43,289 --> 00:17:48,840
do and I work a lot of hours I have

408
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:52,049
monitored certain fraudsters who

409
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:53,549
around literally four years and they are

410
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:55,590
still operating

411
00:17:53,549 --> 00:17:57,990
we haven't been caught because they are

412
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:00,059
able to look again at the security

413
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:01,860
infrastructure in place and say well I

414
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:03,270
can obfuscate because they're not being

415
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:08,129
attention to this they're not paying

416
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:10,350
attention to that so one of the use

417
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:12,570
cases as an as an example out of the

418
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:15,480
hundreds of thousands of examples that

419
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:16,230
we've come across a russian-speaking car

420
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,270
shop owner

421
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:21,179
I want to say car chop I mean black

422
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:24,629
market that's focused on financial fraud

423
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:26,760
is offering four hundred thousand bank

424
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:30,029
accounts you know two hundred and eighty

425
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:32,580
thousand dollars you know $280,000

426
00:18:30,029 --> 00:18:34,620
sounds like a lot of money but it's

427
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:37,740
really not when you have access to four

428
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:39,209
hundred thousand bank accounts you can

429
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:42,120
essentially make millions if not

430
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:44,640
hundreds of millions some of those bank

431
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,760
accounts can have thousands hundreds

432
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:50,360
thousands even millions of dollars and

433
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:53,190
neither the bank nor the account owners

434
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:58,799
many times have an idea

435
00:18:53,190 --> 00:19:01,320
and tell us of course too late so my

436
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,190
last use case is on violent non-state

437
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:07,200
actors which is really my expertise I

438
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:10,500
mentioned early on terrorist groups and

439
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,120
their supporters proliferating they

440
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:15,720
understand as much as cyber criminals

441
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:19,678
that the the underground environments

442
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:22,649
online are more protective of their

443
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:24,299
identities they're able to again network

444
00:19:22,649 --> 00:19:26,639
with like-minded individuals without

445
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:28,470
having to worry about potentially

446
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,419
security leaders or law enforcement or

447
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:31,789
others being in these environments and

448
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:34,230
if they are in these environments

449
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:35,789
attributing that moniker to that

450
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:39,960
identity becomes extremely difficult

451
00:19:35,789 --> 00:19:42,779
many times impossible so it is providing

452
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:44,730
layers of security for them and that's

453
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:47,299
why they're able to network purchase

454
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:49,799
weapons purchase fraudulent documents

455
00:19:47,299 --> 00:19:51,870
conduct terror financing really raise

456
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:53,730
money through fraudulent activities like

457
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:55,500
spamming and then send that money to

458
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:57,210
groups like Isis or al-qaeda or the

459
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,789
Pakistani Taliban or Shabaab Mujahideen

460
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:01,860
or many other groups and we've seen real

461
00:19:59,789 --> 00:20:02,610
examples of that actually just recently

462
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:06,990
we saw

463
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:09,959
a new al-qaeda supportive media unit

464
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:11,850
using Bitcoin for fundraising now this

465
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,530
is not the first time we see Bitcoin

466
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:17,580
being used to fundraise terrorist

467
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:21,030
activities but it is now picking up even

468
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:22,409
more because you know early on Bitcoin

469
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:25,620
was very difficult to understand for

470
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:27,260
many people now you can have 15 year old

471
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,139
to understand exactly how Bitcoin works

472
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:33,750
as a matter of fact I was walking down

473
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:35,940
here in in the Gold Coast and I saw a

474
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,799
liquor store that accepts Bitcoin to

475
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:42,900
purchase liquor which I thought was

476
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:44,970
fascinating and so the whole idea is

477
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:48,450
that you utilize whatever available

478
00:20:44,970 --> 00:20:49,919
tools and means that are always kind of

479
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:51,750
it's a pool of resources this

480
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,960
environment that allows you to you know

481
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:57,660
download free software have tutorials

482
00:20:53,960 --> 00:21:00,480
you know you can you can easily download

483
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:03,870
dozens of manuals that would allow you

484
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,780
to go from somebody who has no idea how

485
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:09,000
to be a terrorist or a cyber criminal to

486
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:12,290
be somebody who can really op the skate

487
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:15,270
and bypass the scrutiny for many years

488
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:18,600
there's something called I call

489
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:21,179
terrorism on the girl as an example back

490
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:26,490
in the day in my early work here it used

491
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:29,580
to be very difficult for supporters of

492
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:30,960
terrorist groups to obtain manuals

493
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,299
because what they have to do is they

494
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,370
have to share an actual paper copy and

495
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:38,900
that was very difficult to come by

496
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:41,340
sometimes there are written copies and

497
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:45,809
with the advent of course of technology

498
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:47,490
and cyberspace early on it was to share

499
00:21:45,809 --> 00:21:50,190
manuals you need to upload them to

500
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:53,610
temporary upload file upload servers and

501
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:56,040
then share the link and then it's a

502
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:58,770
password-protected link and then shared

503
00:21:56,040 --> 00:22:00,440
the 32 character password to download

504
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:03,540
that manual but of course these are

505
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,520
sites that are infested with pop-ups and

506
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:07,678
many times even just difficult to

507
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:11,570
navigate and you might be downloading a

508
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:14,640
malware but of course with the

509
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:16,620
advancement of technology and having you

510
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:20,340
know cloud services

511
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:22,799
and so on a terrorist's or supporter of

512
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:25,110
terrorist group can have all of that on

513
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,908
his phone is able to access really

514
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:29,399
dangerous areas of the internet like

515
00:22:26,909 --> 00:22:31,710
encrypted telegram channels where Isis

516
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:34,130
and other groups are operating and be

517
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:36,720
able to just easily scroll through the

518
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:40,710
searchable manual and look for a recipe

519
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:45,659
to build a bomb or to train on ak-47 and

520
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:48,960
others and because it is such a prolific

521
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:51,570
environment where hundreds of thousands

522
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,799
of these individuals are operating not

523
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:56,210
only they're learning from each other

524
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:59,668
but they're able to share things like

525
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:02,480
Target endorsements what are the best

526
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:06,630
targets that would generate publicity

527
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:08,370
for a for a terrorist group what about a

528
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:12,059
hit list let's put together a hit list

529
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:17,939
that would generate so much publicity we

530
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:19,289
saw hackers supportive of Isis release

531
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:23,480
the personally identifiable information

532
00:23:19,289 --> 00:23:27,120
of thousands of people including over

533
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:29,039
1200 American government personnel I'm

534
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,250
talking about their name their address

535
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:35,700
their phone numbers their work address

536
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:36,990
and potentially their in some of those

537
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,120
individuals might be undercover their

538
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:43,679
real identity well how were they able to

539
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:46,020
do it one way of doing it is not through

540
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,059
hacking really but collecting that

541
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:49,710
information from social media

542
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:51,629
it's amazing you might be you might say

543
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:53,610
like you know I use Facebook but I only

544
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:55,799
have a very limited number of friends

545
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:58,678
it's just for family members it's

546
00:23:55,799 --> 00:24:00,809
confined in these environments but do

547
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:04,770
you know what your brother or sister or

548
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:06,928
cousin or friend or others how much they

549
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,918
are protecting their Facebook account or

550
00:24:06,929 --> 00:24:09,360
how much they're protecting their own

551
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:12,240
Twitter account do they have two-factor

552
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,439
authentication are they are they saying

553
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,899
where they are sitting in which

554
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,419
restaurant are they talking about the

555
00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:20,340
places they're visiting are they going

556
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:22,860
on a vacation in a specific place all of

557
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:30,959
this data is easily accessible for those

558
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:34,139
individuals and lastly when when more

559
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:37,080
when we have more security measures in

560
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:41,340
place and we try our best to understand

561
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:43,939
the threat activity we look at new

562
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:48,899
targets like industrial control systems

563
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:50,610
SCADA systems because while they you

564
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:52,620
know are very difficult almost

565
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:56,189
impossible by many individuals to

566
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:57,389
actually penetrate and hack the violent

567
00:24:56,190 --> 00:24:59,820
non-state actors are looking at it from

568
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:02,220
a different perspective they're saying

569
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:07,289
if I am able to potentially recruit

570
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:09,419
somebody within buildings where there is

571
00:25:07,289 --> 00:25:12,470
industrial control systems then I could

572
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:16,799
potentially hack it from the inside

573
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:18,600
so one example of kind of you know

574
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,070
blurring the physical and cyber realm

575
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:23,030
you know individuals who are

576
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:26,220
ideologically influenced they're behind

577
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:28,500
trying to cause physical damage but

578
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:33,200
they're advancing their cyber skill set

579
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:36,480
so one Pro Isis hacker from a

580
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:40,200
password-protected vetted Isis

581
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:45,030
environment who's at the time I put this

582
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:47,370
together had nearly 1200 postings most

583
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:50,730
of it actually focused not on physical

584
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:53,100
threat or physical activity this is a

585
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:55,880
software developer ideologically

586
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:59,668
influenced soft software developer who

587
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:01,260
decided that it is better to go in the

588
00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:03,690
cyber warfare realm

589
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:06,240
instead of conduct actual physical

590
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:07,860
attack well because one it is a it can

591
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,299
attract a lot of attention we're seeing

592
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,889
you know bombings happen in many

593
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:13,139
different parts of the world and attacks

594
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:16,830
and so on but he's basically saying that

595
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:23,940
if I am able to develop a tool that

596
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:26,250
would hack a government domain steal the

597
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,230
data and release it in public that is

598
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:30,480
generating so much more publicity and

599
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:33,450
it's elevating the notoriety of

600
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:38,309
terrorist groups that I'm supporting so

601
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:39,900
he organized a DDoS campaign in this

602
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:42,960
forum and this forum is confined to

603
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,200
about only 20,000 individuals no more so

604
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,000
you

605
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,019
can't be somebody who's like I'm

606
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,940
interested I want to make a new account

607
00:26:46,019 --> 00:26:49,620
no it doesn't work that way

608
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:54,059
you need the recommendation by specific

609
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:56,459
user who's up in the ranks so as I as I

610
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:59,639
monitoring this activity I come across

611
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:02,399
three different tools that he developed

612
00:26:59,639 --> 00:27:05,158
I talked about the DDoS tool which he

613
00:27:02,399 --> 00:27:08,668
called Caliphate cannon I mean it's kind

614
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:10,679
of funny but it it is also dangerous

615
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:12,919
because he used this tool to target

616
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:16,529
seven different seven different

617
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:18,870
government websites successfully taking

618
00:27:16,529 --> 00:27:21,179
down the website of the Egyptian

619
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:25,559
Ministry of Interior and the Iraqi

620
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:28,200
Ministry of oil so this is these are the

621
00:27:25,559 --> 00:27:29,600
efforts of one individual on his own

622
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:33,630
without backup

623
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:35,399
now they remain under sophisticated in

624
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:37,889
this domain but all they're doing right

625
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:41,870
now is that they're learning they're

626
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:45,600
advancing and potentially they will be

627
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:47,549
walking alongside none ideologically

628
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:50,399
influenced really advanced cyber

629
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:52,980
criminals and then learn from them so

630
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:56,189
they can masks themselves they can mask

631
00:27:52,980 --> 00:28:02,970
themselves as cyber criminals create

632
00:27:56,190 --> 00:28:04,380
account on black markets or in forums

633
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:06,360
where there are financially motivated

634
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:08,370
hackers and then learn from their

635
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:10,080
tactics techniques and procedures learn

636
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:12,479
from the manuals they're releasing there

637
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:16,110
and then apply that against their own

638
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,210
targets so a flashpoint we you know I

639
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:21,799
mentioned the intelligence trifecta so

640
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:23,700
as I come across this activity so

641
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:27,029
understanding the source first of all

642
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:29,490
this is a an important source for Isis

643
00:28:27,029 --> 00:28:32,309
we have over the years validated how

644
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:35,039
important the information there is then

645
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:36,769
we look at the actor how legitimate is

646
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,460
that actor so we take these tools

647
00:28:36,769 --> 00:28:40,440
reverse-engineer them trying to

648
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:42,389
understand what they do what is the

649
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,570
impact they can cause and then

650
00:28:42,389 --> 00:28:47,010
essentially profile that actor so when

651
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:48,658
security leaders are looking at this

652
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:51,539
profile and they're saying ok now I

653
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:53,730
understand the recent or latest tactics

654
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:55,529
techniques and procedures used by actors

655
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:56,909
who are supportive of terrorist groups

656
00:28:55,529 --> 00:28:59,190
yet they are at

657
00:28:56,909 --> 00:29:00,809
there're cyber skill set now I can

658
00:28:59,190 --> 00:29:03,059
actually put mitigation measures in

659
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:05,840
place and potentially try to do

660
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:08,009
attribution by understanding the code

661
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,418
used in these tools or trying to

662
00:29:08,009 --> 00:29:12,479
understand how long they've been

663
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:15,330
operating potentially have an actor

664
00:29:12,479 --> 00:29:19,259
engagement and actually talk to them to

665
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:21,840
get more information so the the use

666
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:24,320
cases that we practically applied and

667
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:26,639
this is just you know a snippet of it

668
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,700
from an insider threat we were able to

669
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:32,549
identify a rogue employee as I mentioned

670
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:34,799
at a multinational technology company

671
00:29:32,549 --> 00:29:39,418
who was selling a source code of a non

672
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:42,149
released enterprise level software so

673
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:44,609
what that did by informing the client

674
00:29:42,149 --> 00:29:47,189
we're preserving the intellectual

675
00:29:44,609 --> 00:29:49,408
property of that client similarly for a

676
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:53,879
fraud identify the scheme to exploit at

677
00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:56,849
the time of the upcoming EMV and the

678
00:29:53,879 --> 00:30:00,418
result of course being aware is that you

679
00:29:56,849 --> 00:30:02,939
mitigated financial loss from a physical

680
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:04,950
security and executive protection we

681
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:07,769
identified a previously unknown threat

682
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:09,720
actor within the vicinity of where a

683
00:30:07,769 --> 00:30:11,580
specific executive from a fortune 100

684
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:14,519
company was about to be present and

685
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:17,340
publicly present by identifying this

686
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:20,429
threat actor in that location we're

687
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:22,228
essentially protecting that executive by

688
00:30:20,429 --> 00:30:26,489
their security team putting mitigation

689
00:30:22,229 --> 00:30:28,109
measures in place so this is my this is

690
00:30:26,489 --> 00:30:30,690
my talk thank you so much for listening

691
00:30:28,109 --> 00:30:32,850
I hope it was informative and I'm open

692
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:38,290
to any questions

693
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:38,290
[Applause]

694
00:30:55,540 --> 00:31:02,200
yeah and it's a really good question so

695
00:30:57,370 --> 00:31:05,909
we come across threats 200 thou make

696
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:09,990
thousands of companies worldwide

697
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:12,940
governments and so on so it becomes an

698
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:14,590
exhaustive approach to notify everybody

699
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:16,540
about every threat we come across and

700
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:19,030
because these environments are so full

701
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:20,830
of threat it could literally you could

702
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:23,770
literally have a team of a hundred

703
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:25,540
people just informing others like a data

704
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:27,430
center just literally giving everybody a

705
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:30,970
call so we don't do that so it's usually

706
00:31:27,430 --> 00:31:34,860
an existing client however when we come

707
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:37,390
across something of an imminent threat

708
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:39,629
that's something we are able to inform

709
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:45,160
one law enforcement about and then

710
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:46,900
softly reach to the prospect let's call

711
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,880
them a prospect instrument reach that

712
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:51,070
prospect and say there is an imminent

713
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:56,080
threat we observed we can't always

714
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:57,639
validate or attribute but we want to let

715
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,860
you know that this is these are the

716
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:02,410
TTP's they're talking about they're

717
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:05,010
talking about your event and so on so

718
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:08,620
one one example I can tell you

719
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:13,030
Disneyland in Paris an individual

720
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:16,899
supportive of Isis released maps of

721
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:18,490
every entry and exit point and said on

722
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:23,220
this day there's going to be this

723
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:26,950
massive attendance so if you want to

724
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:28,810
target a very legitimate target this is

725
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:31,690
actually really good and here let me

726
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:33,490
also tell you who's attending and so

727
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:35,230
when we when we see something like that

728
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:39,340
it doesn't matter if the French

729
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:44,800
government is a client of ours we're

730
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:46,360
able to through our own our own contacts

731
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,669
in law enforcement in a place like the

732
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,050
United States or the UK or others get

733
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:53,680
that information across as fast as

734
00:32:50,050 --> 00:32:57,250
possible so it can be both but if we

735
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:58,870
can't inform every every potential

736
00:32:57,250 --> 00:33:01,840
prospect because we just come across

737
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:04,350
hundreds and thousands of them I hope

738
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,350
that answers your question

739
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:17,230
others well great thank you so much for

740
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:20,470
your time we appreciate you thank you

741
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:20,470
thanks very much
