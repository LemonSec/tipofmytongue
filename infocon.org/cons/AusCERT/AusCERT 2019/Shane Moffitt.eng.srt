1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,350
okay so now this morning we have Shane

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,940
Moffat the assistant Saizo for the

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,428
Victorian Department of premier and

4
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:09,690
cabinet talking to us about the training

5
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:15,809
in the whole Victorian Government's

6
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:18,090
please welcome show so once like

7
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,859
correction the rules actually the whole

8
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:21,779
of Victorian government role so the way

9
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:23,279
the Victorian Government strategies we

10
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:26,070
have the departments and the entities

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,539
and our role is worlds based inside

12
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,580
Department of premium cabinet is

13
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,399
actually looking at the entirety of

14
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:43,519
Victorian government which is relevant

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:47,370
to some of the slides sir no hi

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,860
excellent so yeah as it says on the tin

17
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:52,230
this conversation on this presentation

18
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:53,699
is really what we're doing in Victorian

19
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:55,709
government as a whole of victorian

20
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:58,379
government deployment of training and

21
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,420
awareness so today's presentation is

22
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:02,608
I'll tell you talk you through the story

23
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,070
today it's certainly not a finished

24
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,810
story and something I expect that's

25
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:11,009
going to go on for quite a number of

26
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:13,170
years so the start of this was I started

27
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:14,970
this role about 15 months ago and

28
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,430
approach should stop walking around so I

29
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,920
feel like I'm causing an echo I'm gonna

30
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,420
walk out of here

31
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,130
so I started not that's worse

32
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:28,530
[Laughter]

33
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:33,210
so I started this role about 15 months

34
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:35,549
ago and one of the key activities had to

35
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,250
do was deliver the state cyber security

36
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:40,320
strategy and those two lines in it and

37
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:41,820
the foot all those number of different

38
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,250
actions in it but there's two relevant

39
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,639
actions and the first was to develop at

40
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:49,470
an operate community and communicate

41
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,630
engagement program for cyber security

42
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:53,460
awareness within government and the

43
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:55,320
second was established with VMI a a

44
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,640
cyber capability uplift program

45
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,089
including cyber security training

46
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,880
education events programs and seminars

47
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:05,820
so this two immediate questions came to

48
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,679
my mind walls who the hell's bmia and

49
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:09,840
the second was what's the difference

50
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,330
between training awareness because

51
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,830
they've listed them as separate actions

52
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:15,200
and

53
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:20,540
probably historically in my mind I've

54
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:24,049
mainly been the same thing so I had to

55
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:26,179
deliver this and what I needed to do to

56
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:28,250
get my head around what we had to do was

57
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:30,290
I wanted to develop a framework and I

58
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:33,950
needed some questions asked before we

59
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:35,660
could get started and these were my

60
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:39,200
questions I wanted these questions

61
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:40,910
answered before we started and the first

62
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,220
one was what do we want to achieve from

63
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:45,380
the training I don't want to tick off

64
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:46,730
boxes I don't want to just go ah

65
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,609
training done

66
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:52,640
tick when is done tick it needs to be

67
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:54,710
more than that and what might be obvious

68
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,420
what you want to achieve

69
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:58,070
everyone's obvious is a little bit

70
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:00,500
different and sometimes it's very

71
00:02:58,070 --> 00:03:02,829
different so unless you can clearly

72
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:04,640
define what you want to achieve

73
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:07,790
everyone's just going to get off in

74
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,880
their different paths so really want to

75
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:14,480
be clear with us about what clearly are

76
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:17,780
we trying to do the second thing is I

77
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,070
want to know who are we training the

78
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,140
Victorian Government's a fairly large

79
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:23,660
Beast and I'll talk about that a little

80
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:26,089
bit later but the key thing is I wanted

81
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:29,540
to be really clear about before we went

82
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:30,770
forward is who are we training the third

83
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:34,040
was what's the difference between

84
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:35,930
training and awareness and the fourth

85
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,299
question is I needed to have comfort

86
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:39,530
that we would be able to measure if we

87
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:41,120
were successful or not

88
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:44,870
we would need to know whether this

89
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,520
worked or not before we started so if it

90
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,040
works great we keep doing if it doesn't

91
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:53,980
work we change so I wanted those four

92
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:57,709
questions answered before we started so

93
00:03:53,980 --> 00:04:01,299
we've adopted a particular model on how

94
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:04,040
we define what we want to achieve and

95
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:06,739
what it's called it's a behavior based

96
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,929
model and under this model there's only

97
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:11,150
two reasons you do training awareness

98
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:14,720
there's only two reasons and they

99
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:16,519
universally apply right the first one is

100
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:21,108
you want to start a behavior that's not

101
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:24,110
currently occurring and by behavior we

102
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:25,799
have really broad definitions we can be

103
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:29,430
incredibly micro

104
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,379
so for example if C is a simplified

105
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:34,319
example you're training people how to

106
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:36,030
drive you go the behavior we want is we

107
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:38,759
want them to keep to the left-hand side

108
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:42,539
of the white line really simple very

109
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:44,430
specific very easy to measure another

110
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:46,068
behavior is we only want people to go

111
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:50,430
into an intersection when it's safe

112
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:53,129
right far more complex but it's still

113
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:56,400
behavior so that's the model we use

114
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:59,130
right so one reason is to start a

115
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,469
behavior the second reason is to stop a

116
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:05,759
behavior if people are doing things we

117
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:09,150
don't want them to do right and that can

118
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,669
be people might be misclassifying data

119
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,888
and they might be calling a secret when

120
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:17,008
there should be for official use only or

121
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:18,990
it can be anything else but everything

122
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:21,180
that we've come across can fit into

123
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:22,740
these two behavior into these two

124
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,229
categories I've never come across a

125
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,479
situation where we can't define our

126
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:32,818
objective as either trying to start or

127
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:37,889
stop a behavior so how do we choose the

128
00:05:32,819 --> 00:05:41,219
behaviors that we want so we can't do

129
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:44,099
everything right and our program is not

130
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:45,779
intended to replace the training for all

131
00:05:44,099 --> 00:05:48,180
public servants inside of the victorian

132
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:50,240
government the entity is too big but

133
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,199
what we want to do is choose the

134
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,349
behaviors and the investment that's

135
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:58,919
going to produce the most returns right

136
00:05:55,349 --> 00:06:01,680
so there's a cost of labour and money

137
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:03,419
that goes into developing training the

138
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,979
biggest cost is the actual time of the

139
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:07,859
person sitting there doing the training

140
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:09,779
right the hundred thousand half million

141
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,279
dollars you go into creating it is

142
00:06:09,779 --> 00:06:12,690
actually the cheapest part of the

143
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,389
training

144
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:17,969
the cost is taking a police officer off

145
00:06:15,389 --> 00:06:20,669
the streets and sitting in front of the

146
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:24,569
computer or taken a nurse off from doing

147
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:26,750
rounds that cost massively exceeds the

148
00:06:24,569 --> 00:06:30,090
cost of actually developing the training

149
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:32,969
so we needed to be smarter on what we

150
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:37,049
don't so we just looked at what is

151
00:06:32,969 --> 00:06:38,580
actually causing the harm now and we're

152
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,360
very fortunate inside the Victorian

153
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,639
Government there

154
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,120
our office has a central incident

155
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,949
registry so any incident that occurs to

156
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,050
any entity inside the Victorian

157
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:51,770
Government they're supposed to notify us

158
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,759
and we record it sometimes we assist

159
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:55,919
depending on requirements

160
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,500
sometimes we coordinate if there's

161
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,688
multiple entities being affected but

162
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,050
ultimately we seek to have visibility

163
00:07:00,689 --> 00:07:05,849
over all incidents and we get pretty

164
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,939
good reporting we hope it to be better

165
00:07:05,849 --> 00:07:10,349
over time but we get pretty good insight

166
00:07:07,939 --> 00:07:13,919
so we look through that to see what's

167
00:07:10,349 --> 00:07:16,740
causing the harm and then that's what we

168
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,500
call a lagging indicator right we also

169
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:22,699
look at what's going to cause harm so we

170
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:26,969
know we have so the victorian government

171
00:07:22,699 --> 00:07:28,860
might like many large enterprises has an

172
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:30,449
issue of ICT asset management and

173
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:34,919
currency and keeping things up to date

174
00:07:30,449 --> 00:07:37,529
what we call legacy kit we know that

175
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:39,628
will cause huh so we want to get

176
00:07:37,529 --> 00:07:41,520
proactive on that and getting people to

177
00:07:39,629 --> 00:07:44,969
actually address it before the harms

178
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:47,219
caused so looking forward you have less

179
00:07:44,969 --> 00:07:49,650
certainty then you do have it looking

180
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:52,289
back so you need to be confident that

181
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:53,818
the impact and likelihood is higher than

182
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:59,520
your lagging indicators and you want to

183
00:07:53,819 --> 00:08:01,289
balance the two off all right so after

184
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,389
all that I was comfortable that we would

185
00:08:01,289 --> 00:08:06,509
be able to clearly define what we want

186
00:08:03,389 --> 00:08:09,990
to achieve the next question that we had

187
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:11,669
or I had was who are we training and

188
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:13,740
I've been inside a Victorian government

189
00:08:11,669 --> 00:08:16,979
before and I can sold it into government

190
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,900
over quite a few years but didn't really

191
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:20,550
grasp the size of Victorian government

192
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:24,448
until I started this role and took on a

193
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:26,190
whole of eternity on my role they want

194
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:28,819
to hazard to guess how many people are

195
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:39,029
employed by the Victorian Government

196
00:08:28,819 --> 00:08:41,430
60,000 sorry closer is as of 2017 is 311

197
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:46,230
thousand three hundred and fifty three

198
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:49,380
people I do not know is I in the state

199
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,880
of those I because not all those people

200
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,910
live in Victorian we have offices around

201
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,339
the world the state of Victoria I think

202
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,170
there's about five million I do know it

203
00:08:56,339 --> 00:09:02,940
is about eight to nine percent of the

204
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:13,729
Victorian workforce see fantastic

205
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:18,870
excellent yeah so it's a lot of people

206
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:21,180
and what you will notice is like the

207
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,490
department it's people think of the

208
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,109
government as the department and the

209
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:27,600
vast majority of the government is not

210
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:31,050
the departments it's the schools it's

211
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,209
the hospitals it's the arborists these

212
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:35,219
is the Victorian Government the office

213
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:39,719
work is in the back are basically the

214
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:42,240
backend office so we needed to break

215
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:45,300
this workforce down right we needed a

216
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:48,569
way of separating across that was simple

217
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:51,449
but effective and basically we copied

218
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:54,060
what we've done for our ICT strategy and

219
00:09:51,449 --> 00:09:56,660
we created three personas and the first

220
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:59,010
persona is executives and these are

221
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:01,850
decision makers inside of an

222
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:03,000
organization right and this can be

223
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:08,010
secretary

224
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:10,190
this can be judge this can be CIO or and

225
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:11,730
you know H if role or a head over all

226
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:14,850
the titles

227
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:17,040
fairly irrelevant the key aspect is they

228
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:19,800
have been entrusted to deliver outcomes

229
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:21,270
for the Victorian public and given X

230
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,709
amount of resources and they need to

231
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:27,839
make decisions on how those resources

232
00:10:22,709 --> 00:10:30,750
are allocated so for example people who

233
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,060
run the hospitals go delay invest in a

234
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:35,250
penetration test or do a buy and you

235
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:39,089
heart monitor those are the decisions

236
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:42,839
they need to make so yep

237
00:10:39,089 --> 00:10:45,149
so the first persona circum Sona is ICT

238
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,940
workers and this is anyone who has an IT

239
00:10:45,149 --> 00:10:50,579
job and this can be entry-level helped

240
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:53,399
us operators right up to your CIO and

241
00:10:50,579 --> 00:10:55,319
you CIO sits in both categories right

242
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:56,010
they are both an executive and an ICT

243
00:10:55,319 --> 00:10:58,860
work

244
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:02,790
so there is overlap and the final

245
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:04,680
persona is everyone is anyone who

246
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:08,219
engaged who works for the Victorian

247
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:10,709
Government in any role and this is an

248
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,990
incredibly diverse group and I would

249
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:16,230
suggest it's one of the most diverse

250
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:19,650
workforces in Australia any metric you

251
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:21,150
care to use we are at both ends and a

252
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:26,579
lot in the middle on where there are ads

253
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:30,569
age education we have teams that are

254
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:33,540
exclusively made of PhDs and higher

255
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:35,880
educated people we have workplaces of

256
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:38,010
our workforce that don't have a year

257
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:41,220
nine education right an English may be

258
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:43,350
the second or third language like we

259
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:48,420
have that full spectrum and we need to

260
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:50,370
cater for that and plan for that no my

261
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:53,430
next question was what's the difference

262
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:56,450
between training and awareness and I

263
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:59,790
really want that clear in my mind now

264
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:02,850
this is my favorite diagram in all the

265
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:04,770
world and I have seen many many diagrams

266
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:06,210
and it's been my favorite diagram for

267
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:07,020
the last two years and I think I'll stay

268
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,790
for a while

269
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:12,900
and it's called the Fogg diagram and

270
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:17,250
it's about behavioral change and if you

271
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:20,010
look at this area know this area this is

272
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:21,720
success and this is failure and this is

273
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,850
about whether a behavior change occurs

274
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,700
online and there's two components to

275
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:28,590
achieving behavior change that is

276
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:32,070
someone's motivation to do it and

277
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:35,850
someone's capability to do it so there's

278
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:41,070
really and to simplify the example of

279
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:42,750
this is if I was to go to max who some

280
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:45,780
of my team in there and also go to max

281
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:48,660
go give me $10 now and I'll give you

282
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:51,030
$1,000 by the end of the day max is both

283
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:52,020
capable of doing that and he believes

284
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,250
that it would actually give him the

285
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,670
thousand dollars at the end of the day

286
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:57,930
he's probably highly motivated to do it

287
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:59,430
if I was to go to Mexico give me a

288
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,989
thousand dollars in getting nothing in

289
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:02,640
return

290
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:06,090
you might be capable of doing that these

291
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:09,290
motivations zero so he's unlikely to do

292
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:12,410
it the other way goes round in the

293
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:14,660
that he can raise people's motivation

294
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:17,569
but they may not have the capability to

295
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,579
do it so the other example is I could go

296
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:21,710
to max guy give me a million dollars in

297
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:23,060
the next 15 minutes or gonna launch a

298
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:26,000
nuclear attack on the state of Victoria

299
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:27,109
and we believe me you might be highly

300
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,720
motivated to do it

301
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:31,520
he's just there's very few people in the

302
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:35,570
world I have the ability to come up with

303
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:37,960
a million dollars in 15 minutes in merge

304
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:42,110
with the money so we need to understand

305
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:45,680
what are we trying to do so with this is

306
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:49,520
and this is where awareness and training

307
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:52,670
separates we mainly use awareness to

308
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:56,210
drive motivation to make someone want to

309
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:59,449
do it and we mainly use training to

310
00:13:56,210 --> 00:14:04,580
increase a person's ability to do it so

311
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:06,650
it's a capability spectrum so the other

312
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:09,830
aspect is when you're talking about the

313
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:12,010
workforce is we're talking about a lot

314
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:15,290
of people and there's going to be a

315
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:17,689
point where it's good enough we are not

316
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:20,030
going to get our behavior change in the

317
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:23,840
entire workforce but what we're trying

318
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:26,510
to do is this just trying to move that a

319
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:29,120
bit and we can move that a bit that will

320
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:30,650
have a big impact and there's a lot of

321
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:33,140
people who have changed their behavior

322
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:35,780
but we need to know and ourselves and

323
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,550
defining ourselves what is their

324
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:41,089
acceptable level and what's effective

325
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:42,890
because he had a point of the investment

326
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:45,050
point of diminishing returns has he need

327
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:47,120
to spend more and more and more to get

328
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:54,079
uh smaller and smaller people across the

329
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:58,430
line and my final question was how are

330
00:14:54,080 --> 00:15:00,860
we going to know if this worked so we

331
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:02,449
once again looked at our objectives and

332
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:07,040
we looked at what happens in the market

333
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:09,680
or in practice and we use a 0 to 3 model

334
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:15,079
on measuring the effectiveness of it and

335
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:16,969
the first one is you know fairly common

336
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:20,540
and those unstructured known plan or

337
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,930
monitoring that is your posters in the

338
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,349
lobby

339
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:24,150
that's your ran

340
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:26,580
intranet articles that's your

341
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:29,160
availability to trainee with no tracking

342
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:31,890
no knowledge of who's doing it if it's

343
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:36,449
effective whether there's comprehension

344
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:38,520
or not and well it seems really bad it's

345
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:41,310
actually a really common thing

346
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,980
I'm sure you've all sat there knowing

347
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:46,589
that these internet articles or random

348
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:48,960
emails they come out and not really

349
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:52,950
known about whether it's better worked

350
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:54,480
on that the second or the next level is

351
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:57,450
level one and that's where we track

352
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,090
distribution and the most common example

353
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:00,450
that this is induction training all

354
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,340
right

355
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,750
you sit there spend your days when

356
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:06,420
you're half days it's been you two weeks

357
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:08,160
depending on the organization you sit

358
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:12,209
there and you go through everything and

359
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,860
go tick dump and they track who's done

360
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:15,960
it and this can be instructed led train

361
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:18,360
this can be web-based learning modules

362
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:20,250
it could be any mechanism but it's just

363
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:24,390
you know have you done the training on

364
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:27,750
that the next level and this is where

365
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:30,360
we're getting to but I want to go higher

366
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,830
is comprehension and that's if you do

367
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:35,370
the training there's a test at the end

368
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:37,410
you need to score so well to move on to

369
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:40,110
be successful you've done it and that

370
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:42,240
once again the most common form of this

371
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:44,310
is your web-based learning module your

372
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:47,280
login you do it you click through as

373
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:50,790
quickly as possible and you tick some

374
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:52,589
boxes at the end in if you've done so in

375
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:56,280
a formal life I was a consultant and I

376
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:58,710
have done hundreds of these things and I

377
00:16:56,280 --> 00:17:00,350
got through them in record time and got

378
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:03,870
straight to the questions at the end

379
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:06,630
attract comprehension and that's pretty

380
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:08,880
good but where I want us to get to and

381
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:10,589
we're certainly not there yet is I

382
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,820
actually want to track the behavior

383
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:16,550
change I actually want a baseline what

384
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:19,829
the behavior is and how often it occurs

385
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:23,069
before we roll out and then I want you

386
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:25,290
to track it after we roll out and that

387
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:27,869
is our objective we're certainly not

388
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:30,060
there yet but that's the only way I can

389
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:33,719
go hand on heart I have confidence and

390
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:35,970
go I know this is what everything else I

391
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,399
can go I think it's working

392
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:41,009
or I think it's not working but until we

393
00:17:38,399 --> 00:17:42,750
actually get to level three I can't say

394
00:17:41,009 --> 00:17:50,580
with any confidence I can't say

395
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:53,879
confidently that I know it works so have

396
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:58,408
my framework actually start working on

397
00:17:53,879 --> 00:18:00,809
training those bits so this is what it

398
00:17:58,409 --> 00:18:03,090
looks like so the behavior changes that

399
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:06,059
we decided on was we wanted our

400
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:08,009
executives to just lean them a time say

401
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:12,259
succumb to phishing scams or whaling

402
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:14,610
scams I'm sure all your entities have it

403
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:16,440
the Victorian Government is a large

404
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:18,059
enterprise I think the budget this week

405
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,659
was approximately seventy billion

406
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:22,950
dollars in revenue or expenditure you

407
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:24,360
know water mining goes through the

408
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:27,120
Victorian Government attractive target

409
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:29,279
been the government we also have other

410
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:33,120
entities that are very interested in

411
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:35,970
getting an access to senior people and

412
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,889
we know through our internet log that

413
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:41,159
fishing or whaling is a common way that

414
00:18:37,889 --> 00:18:43,110
that occurs the second thing is and

415
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:44,909
thistles a more esoteric one is we

416
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:49,469
wanted people to make more informed

417
00:18:44,909 --> 00:18:51,419
cyber decisions and that that's

418
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:55,409
stretching the behavior aspect but it

419
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:59,549
does work and that was based on the fact

420
00:18:55,409 --> 00:19:02,519
that we saw many things that we

421
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:05,039
considered bad decisions or the outcomes

422
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:07,230
are bad decisions and they were made at

423
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:09,870
the executive level and it's talking to

424
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:11,250
a lot of people is apparently the

425
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:12,149
decisions haven't been made at the

426
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,980
executive level

427
00:19:12,149 --> 00:19:16,289
apparently the decision haven't formally

428
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,299
been made at all because the executives

429
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:19,529
had pushed down the decision making so

430
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:23,668
they didn't feel comfortable in the

431
00:19:19,529 --> 00:19:25,590
space so to make those decisions occur

432
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:27,090
and the conversations we've had with the

433
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:29,189
executives and people interacted with

434
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:31,230
them well we identified those a need to

435
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:36,509
scale up these people to be able to make

436
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:38,850
informed decisions on to the next

437
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:41,039
persona with tools our ICT workers and

438
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:44,189
that was we wanted to increase Patchen

439
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:47,840
of operating systems right really basic

440
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:50,600
hygiene it's not glamorous but it works

441
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,039
right the amount of incidents that occur

442
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,610
I'm sure everyone's in the same boat

443
00:19:52,039 --> 00:19:57,650
I've just missing patches frustrates me

444
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:59,479
to the Instagram yeah we wanted to

445
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:00,799
increase that and progressively we're

446
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:03,110
going to push all the essential eight

447
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:05,450
and push those through the spectrum and

448
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:06,979
the second activity is we want to

449
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:09,520
increase and improve the quality of

450
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:12,289
reporting to us the cyber incidents and

451
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,639
across the entire public sector we want

452
00:20:12,289 --> 00:20:17,870
to reduce the amount of times they

453
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:22,610
succumb to phishing scams our incident

454
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:26,270
register shows approximately 56% of our

455
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:27,979
incidents would have been prevented if

456
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:31,639
someone had not succumb to a phishing

457
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:33,649
scam right it's ridiculous but that's

458
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:34,909
what the evidence is showing us so

459
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:37,010
that's where we're gonna put some energy

460
00:20:34,909 --> 00:20:38,809
and effort we're never going to get to

461
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:41,059
zero we don't expect to get it to zero

462
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:43,129
but what we're going to do is we are

463
00:20:41,059 --> 00:20:45,080
confident if we can reduce that by 10

464
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:48,880
percent or 20 percent or 50 percent

465
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:51,559
it's worth the investment in both

466
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,529
incidents of themselves and the cost of

467
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:55,908
managing those incidents so we started

468
00:20:54,529 --> 00:20:58,190
doing that and then we worked out we'd

469
00:20:55,909 --> 00:21:00,730
pick the wrong behavior changes because

470
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:03,470
we spoke to our ICT workers and we went

471
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:04,730
patch yeah can't patch you know you need

472
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,200
to patch and they go yeah I know when

473
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:09,919
the inter patch but I can't because

474
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:11,809
equipment out of date right and was the

475
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,370
equipment out of date because my

476
00:21:11,809 --> 00:21:16,460
executive won't give me the money to

477
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:20,719
upgrade it so we changed our behaviors

478
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:22,899
and we went then to decide we want the

479
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,010
executives to stop sweating the assets

480
00:21:22,899 --> 00:21:26,719
and the reason they're doing and

481
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:28,520
sweating the air set C is if something's

482
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:32,029
got a five year lifespan you put it in

483
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:33,500
for eight years right and we spoke to

484
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:35,779
the executive some you know why are you

485
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:38,240
doing this no I'm simplifying a lot of

486
00:21:35,779 --> 00:21:40,940
conversations here and they went well I

487
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,169
got a proposal and they wanted a million

488
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,059
dollars or ten million dollars or a

489
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:46,309
hundred million dollars and they said

490
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:48,049
the system's old we need a new one right

491
00:21:46,309 --> 00:21:50,240
all right I'm gonna need bit more than

492
00:21:48,049 --> 00:21:51,529
that and they went well I'll do that I

493
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,250
said what new features will we get

494
00:21:51,529 --> 00:21:58,490
nothing substantial what efficiency

495
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:59,960
gains we'll get nothing substantial well

496
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:01,760
it will the cost to run it go down

497
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,500
anyway no all actually

498
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,240
because we'll actually be out of patcher

499
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,100
as opposed to the old one which we can't

500
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:15,410
patch so that costs us nothing to keep

501
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:17,899
them so as a CFO I'm going you want 10

502
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:19,760
million dollars and my costs are going

503
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:26,420
to go up and our output is going to stay

504
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:28,850
the same not so what we're trying to do

505
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:31,580
is introduce risk into this conversation

506
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:33,649
and we want our executives to have

507
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:35,990
visibility there is because there are

508
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:38,570
sometimes sweating the asset is the

509
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:41,030
right call and there are times when it's

510
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:44,149
the wrong call and we can't go in with

511
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:47,060
us global rules say they'll must keep

512
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:49,960
the ICT current all right because

513
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:52,780
sometimes it's not Western $109

514
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:55,520
sometimes that money is better spent on

515
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:56,600
doctors and nurses and roads and all the

516
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:01,250
other good things the Victorian

517
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:03,620
Government does so this is the breakdown

518
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:07,040
of what we did with the executive

519
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:08,659
persona right so with reducing the

520
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:11,600
number of times they come in to wailing

521
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:13,520
scams we're creating a web-based

522
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,439
learning module it's going to be short

523
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:19,010
and sharp and I'll be rolled out and be

524
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:22,070
available across the whole sector to

525
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:23,510
make more informed cyber decisions is we

526
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:26,480
partnered with the Australians to the

527
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:27,860
shooter company directors and we did

528
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,950
this for a number of reasons they have a

529
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:32,689
one-day cyber for directors course and

530
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,980
we've already partnered the Victorian

531
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:37,880
Government's already partnered with a

532
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:39,290
ICD to run executive training and they

533
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,930
do the company for directors calls

534
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:45,139
inside the public sector now the reason

535
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:48,080
we partnered with a ICD is they've

536
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:52,160
developed this course in working with

537
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:54,820
dart 61 they are highly experienced to

538
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:57,890
train any executives and highly credible

539
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:01,129
we did not feel that we could create a

540
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:03,890
course better than they could so we took

541
00:24:01,130 --> 00:24:06,260
their course right they also have a full

542
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:08,390
training infrastructure it's a big hoon

543
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:10,760
for them as an organization and they're

544
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:13,700
not a cheap training organization but

545
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,110
they produce high quality training and

546
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:17,240
they have

547
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:18,830
- just when people want to do the course

548
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,380
they can sign up and do the course

549
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:23,389
rather than a stunning one or two or

550
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:25,600
three or ten a year which we probably

551
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:28,190
won't do well because we don't have

552
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:29,719
professional experienced trainers we

553
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:31,309
probably wouldn't create the content as

554
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,500
well because we don't have the time and

555
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:36,980
investment to do it so we weren't with

556
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:39,529
any I sitting and we've also found the

557
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:41,210
executives are more willing to do it

558
00:24:39,529 --> 00:24:42,830
because it's something that they can

559
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:45,620
actually put on their CV and their

560
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:49,840
resume because it has market recognition

561
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:52,840
as a well-respected course and the final

562
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:55,939
behavior change we're doing in two parts

563
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:58,789
one is an awareness video which I'll

564
00:24:55,940 --> 00:25:01,580
show in a second and the second is we

565
00:24:58,789 --> 00:25:03,740
will be developing an ICT asset

566
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:07,129
framework to track the currency of your

567
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:09,830
ICT assets to have visibility all right

568
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:20,149
so I think I've spoken enough I'll show

569
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:23,080
the video hopefully risk the software is

570
00:25:20,149 --> 00:25:23,080
no longer supported

571
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:32,470
I'd love to fix us are really would but

572
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:32,470
I just haven't got the budget

573
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:48,639
we've had jure knows the premier's

574
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:51,070
office everyone's called while people's

575
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,440
personal information is out there this

576
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:55,619
is really happening

577
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,619
[Music]

578
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:06,160
it's a data breach we had that budget

579
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:08,310
update the old software this wouldn't

580
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:08,310
have happened

581
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:21,770
cybersecurity is your business so you'll

582
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:28,170
notice there wasn't actually any useful

583
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:30,929
information in that and I wasn't

584
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:33,840
intended to it wasn't about raising

585
00:26:30,929 --> 00:26:36,870
capability here's about raising

586
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,419
awareness and what we very deliberately

587
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:42,600
did there was we linked it to a business

588
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:45,000
outcome impact so there is no such thing

589
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:47,490
as an IC risk there's no such thing as a

590
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,020
cybersecurity risk you have business

591
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:52,230
risks or you have things that don't

592
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:54,480
matter right a server going down is not

593
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:56,130
a risk the inability to deliver our

594
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,799
service because the server goes down is

595
00:26:56,130 --> 00:27:01,500
a risk and that's the communication that

596
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:04,200
we need to do the executive so this

597
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:06,660
video will be available I've been kind

598
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,490
of white labeled so all the entities can

599
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:10,919
put their own tag lines on it at the end

600
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:12,750
per their own calls to action on it the

601
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:15,320
blanket one that will be sending out and

602
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:18,780
looking for large distribution will be

603
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:21,629
linked to our asset framework and I'll

604
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:24,899
be encouraging executives to download

605
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:27,179
and read the executive summary of the

606
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:29,220
ICT asset framework that'll show them

607
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:31,679
what the currency is there'll be a very

608
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,240
specific document for executives to say

609
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,640
these are the questions it will answer

610
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,200
for you as the organization these are

611
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:40,230
the questions you should be asking as an

612
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:43,500
executive the framework itself is more

613
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:45,950
for the IT workers to putting all the

614
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,179
accountants or a combination of both

615
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:50,190
that's not what we're targeting our

616
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:52,590
targeting is the execs because we need

617
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:54,960
their buying and we can get them to say

618
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:57,059
we need this we need to do it then the

619
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:59,460
rest will follow because the ICT workers

620
00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:02,549
we've been talking to already know it's

621
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:05,970
a problem right and they want to fix it

622
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:08,309
for the most part so what we've done is

623
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:10,650
try to actually concentrate on what's

624
00:28:08,309 --> 00:28:13,410
preventing that behavior from occurring

625
00:28:10,650 --> 00:28:18,929
and feel universally our feedback walls

626
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:23,550
bills the executive support so we're

627
00:28:18,929 --> 00:28:24,340
fairly early in the journey but we did

628
00:28:23,550 --> 00:28:27,370
learn

629
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:30,429
one really really important lesson today

630
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:33,070
and we thought this is what the

631
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:35,080
Victorian public servant was like as an

632
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:38,310
office worker in our office at 80

633
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:40,689
Collins Street sitting in on computer

634
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:43,419
turns out this is what the Victorian

635
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:45,790
Government looks like or the Victorian

636
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:48,640
public sector and that's the sample all

637
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:53,379
three hundred and eleven thousand

638
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:58,270
different people of different races

639
00:28:53,380 --> 00:29:00,550
religions ethnicity genders etc etc and

640
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:03,670
what we did find out is people who wear

641
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:08,680
uniforms identify themselves separately

642
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:11,920
to people who wear suits if you if we

643
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:15,310
when we released a video of an office

644
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:17,740
worker a nurse our police officer

645
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:21,159
immediately disengage and disassociate

646
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:24,760
it with them so it doesn't work

647
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:27,400
effectively so a next round of videos we

648
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:29,230
will be out there we will be with actual

649
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,210
doctors and actual nurses and actual

650
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:33,250
teachers and actual police officers and

651
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:35,110
we will shoot it in hospitals and we

652
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:38,350
will shoot it at schools and all shoot

653
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:40,750
it with arborists and we are going to

654
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:43,600
get outside the office we will not do it

655
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:46,170
inside our office again the other thing

656
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:49,419
that we've done with the training is

657
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:53,140
we're using caricatures of the

658
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:56,200
characters to individuals and what we've

659
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:58,270
done is with their clothing is we put

660
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,510
them all in casual clothing because

661
00:29:58,270 --> 00:30:03,670
while someone who wears a uniform to

662
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:05,470
work or somehow wears a suit to work or

663
00:30:03,670 --> 00:30:08,650
so on where they grab used to work

664
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:10,470
depending on what work they do people

665
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:14,890
wear the similar sort of things at home

666
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:16,540
so the training is all around and the

667
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:20,050
character chairs we're doing is around

668
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:22,899
this home persona and what we've been

669
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:25,080
advised is this will help reduce that

670
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:27,760
disassociation that we have it and the

671
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:30,460
faces are so they identified that you

672
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,260
can't identify gender or ethnicity and

673
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:34,870
so forth because we don't necessarily

674
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:37,240
need the people to see it as themselves

675
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:38,879
but we do need them not to see it as

676
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:41,140
someone

677
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,929
and that's how the Train and I'll go

678
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:46,120
through so those were the key points

679
00:30:43,929 --> 00:30:48,850
probably running a little head of time

680
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:51,809
or about on time was there any questions

681
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:51,809
anyone home

682
00:30:56,549 --> 00:31:02,950
we had consultants in so basically we

683
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:05,678
adopted it from the ICT training and

684
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:08,590
awareness program that's one of the big

685
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:10,570
four consultancies they created it in

686
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:14,230
our next room we'll probably add two

687
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:17,460
more personas and those being the

688
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:20,020
information security specialists and

689
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:23,080
risk specialists inside of organizations

690
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:25,029
and particularly the ordering risk

691
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:28,809
committees somewhere that we want to

692
00:31:25,029 --> 00:31:33,159
spend far more of our time because like

693
00:31:28,809 --> 00:31:35,470
while the ICT aspect of it is important

694
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:38,890
what we're really trying to drive is

695
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:40,600
better risk management and what we're

696
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:42,700
trying to do is uplift the capability of

697
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:47,219
those risk professionals to address

698
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:47,220
cyber or information security risk

699
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:55,350
[Music]

700
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:58,000
[Laughter]

701
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:59,649
interesting that you had to picture back

702
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,450
to being actually about executive

703
00:31:59,649 --> 00:32:04,629
awareness rather than workers did you

704
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:07,899
get pushback from executives who didn't

705
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:09,669
see the training or awareness amongst

706
00:32:07,899 --> 00:32:15,070
the workers was something that they had

707
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:18,730
to work on themselves so I think I did a

708
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:25,210
post on this LinkedIn awhile ago there's

709
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:27,909
30 mm bore members inside of Victoria so

710
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:31,179
and that's that's a really wide spectrum

711
00:32:27,909 --> 00:32:32,980
of different boards and if you look at

712
00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:34,090
the entire executive across the

713
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:37,179
Victorian Government which I don't

714
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:41,918
actually have the numbers for the answer

715
00:32:37,179 --> 00:32:43,899
is yes some pushback anytime you do

716
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,549
anything on scale some will push back

717
00:32:43,899 --> 00:32:48,610
some will jump into the middle of it and

718
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:50,820
the you know standard bell curve

719
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:52,559
most people go

720
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:54,960
I need to do neither active nor

721
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:57,059
resistive to it some will go this is

722
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,460
incredible this has been needed I'm so

723
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:02,220
on board with it and you'll have people

724
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:04,740
go why you telling me these who the hell

725
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:08,070
do you think you are and you'll have

726
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:11,549
that full spectrum and we have an

727
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:13,168
acceptable loss right we're not good we

728
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:15,658
don't have the time and energy to worry

729
00:33:13,169 --> 00:33:17,460
about that last standard deviation all

730
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:20,090
those last two standard deviations so

731
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:23,490
there's 2% of the 3% they're too hard

732
00:33:20,090 --> 00:33:26,340
not worth our time so we let them go and

733
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:33,809
hopefully over time they'll get pulled

734
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:36,480
up with the rest thank you I'm just

735
00:33:33,809 --> 00:33:38,490
wondering how are you and I'm apologize

736
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,429
if I missed it at the beginning but how

737
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:43,919
are you stood up as a group to do what

738
00:33:41,429 --> 00:33:46,679
it is that you're doing because I hear

739
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,450
the message from that point of being

740
00:33:46,679 --> 00:33:51,210
stood up yeah I'm in the position of

741
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:54,990
needing to stand something up yeah sure

742
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:56,460
so we are fortunate so the Victorian

743
00:33:54,990 --> 00:34:00,299
Government had the cybersecurity

744
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:02,669
strategy that's been endorsed by a

745
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:07,250
Victorian cabinet which is you can't go

746
00:34:02,669 --> 00:34:10,200
any more senior except maybe the Queen

747
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:12,449
so yeah so we have that which gives us

748
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:15,089
some authority we were given a budget

749
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:16,618
allocation over four years which is just

750
00:34:15,089 --> 00:34:21,509
you know pretty much unheard off which

751
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:23,639
is really good and but it goes to where

752
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:27,179
we start and where we stop and I didn't

753
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:30,270
talk about it probably should have we

754
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:32,369
are not delivering the training we are

755
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:34,409
creating the materials we're creating

756
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:36,750
the packs and then it's up to the

757
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:40,619
entities to deploy how and when they see

758
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:42,179
fit so across all entities some of them

759
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:43,619
will want to do it some of them want to

760
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:44,970
do it some will have capacity to do it

761
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:47,069
some of them all conflict with

762
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:48,569
activities I already have some of them

763
00:34:47,069 --> 00:34:50,609
will be exactly what they wanted that

764
00:34:48,569 --> 00:34:52,739
particular time someone wanted to do it

765
00:34:50,609 --> 00:34:54,750
at another time

766
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:56,879
so we've devolved that decision-making

767
00:34:54,750 --> 00:35:00,720
delivery aspect of it what we are

768
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:03,900
creating is posters videos instruction

769
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:06,509
packs web-based learning modules

770
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:09,140
the videos the ability to edit and do

771
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:12,450
your own calls to actions in them

772
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:14,009
surveys to test comprehension and

773
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,850
awareness before and after the

774
00:35:14,010 --> 00:35:18,540
campaign's

775
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:20,520
so we develop all the tools but we

776
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:22,710
partner with all the entities for them

777
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:27,150
to deliver how and when they feel is

778
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:53,880
appropriate No well we have no authority

779
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:57,390
in make it mandatory yep yep yeah all

780
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:59,940
right so the question was if I can

781
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:02,730
summarize it was basically how does it

782
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:05,760
work if you don't make it mandatory the

783
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:07,260
answer to that is well we don't have

784
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:12,060
authority to make it mandatory inside

785
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:15,090
the entities the entities do so they can

786
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:20,009
choose to make it mandatory so for

787
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:22,620
example Yarra Valley water money choose

788
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:24,210
to go all our staff have to do it and

789
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:26,400
get their executives to make it

790
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:28,770
mandatory inside their entity right

791
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,930
other into these go oh we don't like

792
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:32,280
mandatory we like to bring people on the

793
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:33,180
journey and make them want to do it

794
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:36,360
right

795
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:38,520
those workforce decisions are best made

796
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:40,110
by the entities themselves because they

797
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,960
understand their entity far better than

798
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:45,330
we could and this is where we'll be

799
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,780
doing tracking of deployment right if no

800
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:52,770
one's deploying the tool there's two

801
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:55,020
reasons for that it's not good or we

802
00:36:52,770 --> 00:36:57,450
haven't sold it well or possibly a

803
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:59,610
combination of those two and if people

804
00:36:57,450 --> 00:37:01,710
aren't deploying it then we will go back

805
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:05,240
and try and make it better or sell it

806
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:07,800
better if we have to make people do it

807
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:14,959
then it's probably an indication that we

808
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:16,780
haven't done our job well yeah the

809
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:18,160
spreadsheet you had a billion

810
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,600
like a typical capability maturity model

811
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,549
is that something you developed in-house

812
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:23,640
or is that I stand a capability maturity

813
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:35,260
model for awareness and training oh

814
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:37,660
sorry this one I we created it but I'm

815
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:39,310
sure it's pretty existed I can't find it

816
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:41,379
anyway

817
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:44,740
so I would love to give you the correct

818
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:47,560
reference of it I'm Shea out the first

819
00:37:44,740 --> 00:38:03,160
people to think of it this way but yeah

820
00:37:47,560 --> 00:38:04,840
I don't know the act reference and we

821
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:06,580
just need to be pragmatic about that if

822
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:09,220
we give people the tools to do it and

823
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:11,049
tell them hey it's really good if you do

824
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,700
it even for your own program in your own

825
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:15,160
knowledge every aren't workforce and

826
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:16,600
then we just tap into the backend of

827
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:19,180
those tools and get the accurate idatd

828
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:22,330
data out of that so we won't do separate

829
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:25,870
ones some entities will deploy the

830
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:28,000
testing tools some will mock and we'll

831
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:39,009
just use the sample of the data to be an

832
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:41,110
indication of the broader workforce at

833
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:46,270
the moment it's really basic

834
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:48,670
it's basically its distribution we will

835
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:50,740
work our way up to comprehension and

836
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:52,720
then we will work our way up to behavior

837
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,169
change so at the moment is very very

838
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,500
simple

839
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:58,210
oh thank you so much I'm very sting

840
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,470
hearing about how Victoria government's

841
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,240
making all of these changes

842
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:04,709
okay good please think so I'm sure he'll

843
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:07,339
be all red light questions

844
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:07,340
