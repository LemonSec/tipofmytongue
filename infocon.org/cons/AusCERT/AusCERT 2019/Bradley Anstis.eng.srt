1
00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:05,130
so the next presentation as I say is

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,290
does the MSS actually make a difference

3
00:00:05,130 --> 00:00:10,440
it's my pleasure to introduce Bradley

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,780
and antis because I write director of

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:14,610
project management at trust wife Bradley

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:16,830
works with partners and customers all

7
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,090
over the world to define the immediate

8
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:21,209
roadmap and longer-term strategic

9
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:23,820
direction of trust waves email and web

10
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:26,279
security solutions Bradley is also

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:28,170
deeply involved in threat research that

12
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:30,720
the true that the trust wave spider labs

13
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,540
team perform in the areas of email and

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,030
web Bradley is a frequent presenter and

15
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,890
commentator has presented all over the

16
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,750
world in leading security conferences

17
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,760
and is frequently in the press on the

18
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:44,789
real world security issues that

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:53,430
customers are experiencing Bradley it's

20
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:56,940
over to you good morning I hope the swag

21
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,690
collection is going well it's always one

22
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,239
of the best things to give away

23
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,620
obviously on your stand as a bag note

24
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,820
for our other vendors because the bigger

25
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,449
the bag then the more square you can

26
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,830
shove in it

27
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:06,450
and you suddenly become one of the most

28
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,490
popular stands in the conference which

29
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:12,030
is all good okay so where we going to

30
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,020
talk about today you know basically talk

31
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,780
about can you really make a difference

32
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:17,009
with managed security services

33
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:18,509
disclaimer obviously trust waivers of

34
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:20,159
managed security services vendor that's

35
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:21,060
why we're talking about can you make a

36
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,950
difference with managed security

37
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:24,509
services and of course at the end of the

38
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,840
presentation the answer is going to be

39
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,640
yes okay so if that's all you're

40
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,290
actually here for then there's I think

41
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,840
there's free ice cream outside great

42
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:37,020
things to go to but I'd love to have you

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,369
stay so we'll start off by looking at

44
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,829
you know where we are today

45
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,299
you know what does what does average

46
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:44,639
look like and obviously we're all

47
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,810
striving for more than average a quick

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,490
evolution of managed security services

49
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,030
where it's actually come from because

50
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,610
there's some really interesting

51
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,560
analogies we can actually draw in other

52
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,060
parts of the marketplace I've also got

53
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,030
some of the latest Australian threat

54
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,579
data just been released by espada labs

55
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:01,049
pretty interesting stats there and then

56
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:02,699
really sort of talking about you know

57
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:05,219
the theme of this conference is you know

58
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,020
don't go it alone right so can you

59
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:09,239
really be the cyber pro your

60
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:10,258
organizations need you to be all by

61
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,730
yourself

62
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,859
and I think you know that's a pretty

63
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,000
interesting concept for the show

64
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,620
when you first saw it you sort of

65
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,030
thought that's a bit of a strange theme

66
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,120
but then you start thinking about it and

67
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,560
it's actually quite a lot of interesting

68
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,660
aspects you can actually draw out a

69
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,850
theme and then finally we'll discuss

70
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,590
where MSS is going and perhaps how you

71
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:30,359
can better use MSS and change the way

72
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:31,980
you think about how you use manage

73
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,550
security services inside your

74
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,429
environment

75
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,440
deal and we're going to do all that in

76
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:40,170
30 minutes but the good news is I can

77
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,970
talk really really fast so if we start

78
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:43,619
drawing falling behind on time I'll just

79
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,520
start talking faster hopefully you'll

80
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,350
keep up okay

81
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,950
that theory does not work in Asia I've

82
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:51,210
found out ok where if I have enough

83
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:53,730
trouble trying to you know track my

84
00:02:51,210 --> 00:02:54,510
accent without you know trying to

85
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,060
understand what I say

86
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,859
so first of all trying to work out where

87
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,250
we are today what does average look like

88
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,780
this for the eagle-eyed among you good

89
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,670
eye chart for those down the back this

90
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,580
is actually in this security model so

91
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,899
it's a standard security model that you

92
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,670
know we certainly use quite a lot when

93
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,500
we're talking to customers about you

94
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:15,329
know what is your current mix where do

95
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,730
you need to be getting to in terms of

96
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:19,830
you know technologies the types of

97
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:21,480
strategies your investment strategies

98
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:24,390
within your organization when it comes

99
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:27,268
to IT security so protect is where we've

100
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,890
all come from right so all that most of

101
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:31,170
the technology the historical technology

102
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,268
we're using firewall whilst s top AV

103
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,790
email gateways web gateways everything

104
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:37,800
else it's all protect technology where

105
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,299
you know we're building the moats that

106
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,640
mokou was talking about this morning the

107
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,590
other point man he made was we got to

108
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,089
kind of give up building those moats and

109
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,459
we're going to start working out how we

110
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,780
can start detecting and responding and

111
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:51,390
this model is telling you exactly the

112
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:53,070
same thing so as you're going through

113
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:55,679
and renewing the technology choices you

114
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:56,940
have inside your environments maybe some

115
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,950
of the vendors that you have you know

116
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,380
been rusted onto for you know the last

117
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,929
several years think about how do I get

118
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:06,660
out of just protect and into detect and

119
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:09,230
respond okay that's what you have to do

120
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:11,700
and there's a saying in the industry

121
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:13,140
I've been in security for maybe not

122
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,660
quite as long as Mikko pretty close

123
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,700
actually that you know it's not a matter

124
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:18,719
of it you know of if you'll get breached

125
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,640
it's a matter of when you'll get

126
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,229
breached and of course you know because

127
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,840
I've been in the industry for so long

128
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:26,310
you know I sort of start taking some of

129
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,280
these things a little bit flippant link

130
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:28,900
but you know

131
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,890
it for most organizations that's

132
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:33,849
actually true so certainly you know

133
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,650
instead of putting everything in to

134
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:39,220
protect you need to be diversifying your

135
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:40,090
investments and detect and respond Cisco

136
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,820
have been doing some pretty interesting

137
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:45,849
research we have too many products and

138
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:47,440
vendors and Australia this is by the way

139
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:49,150
for those that haven't already worked

140
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,530
out I'm actually not from Australia I'm

141
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:52,359
actually from New Zealand so I just like

142
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:53,320
to extract myself from this massive

143
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,260
problem that you have in Australia

144
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,640
because it's all your fault basically

145
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,289
you have too many products and vendors

146
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,090
you're working with now New Zealand's

147
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:04,419
obviously not in this list because we're

148
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:07,150
perfect as everybody knows but in

149
00:05:04,419 --> 00:05:09,159
Australia you know 10% of your

150
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,320
organizations are using more than 50

151
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:16,030
individual products and vendors within

152
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:19,169
their IT security portfolio 50 all right

153
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:23,770
the next section down is 28% are using

154
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:25,900
forgotten a stat 21 to 50 if these are

155
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:27,549
all individual point products all with

156
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,530
their own consoles and dashboards

157
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,360
separate products you need to be logging

158
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,619
in and out of I hope you've got a really

159
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,380
good swiveling chair that's able to

160
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,370
swivel between all those dashboards

161
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,080
because those are a lot of products and

162
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:42,160
services are you really getting value

163
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:43,419
out of every single one of those so this

164
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,600
is creating a lot of the problem that

165
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:49,950
we're seeing too much noise but how do

166
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:53,290
you know what's noise and what's quality

167
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:55,180
another good step from Cisco I don't

168
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:57,550
work for Cisco I promise but these are

169
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,750
just really interesting stats Australia

170
00:05:57,550 --> 00:06:01,780
you're actually doing a quite a lot

171
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:06,010
better here thirty percent of alerts and

172
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:07,390
not investigated which 30 percent how do

173
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:10,150
you determine which alerts you're

174
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:12,159
investigating which ones you're not and

175
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:14,349
you hit point you back to target okay

176
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,090
they were alerted they were alerts

177
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:19,620
coming out what was going on they were

178
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:23,619
looking at the wrong alert it's noise

179
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:25,180
that's the hard thing about this the

180
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,010
interesting thing I see here is Russia

181
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:28,030
is actually one of the ones that are

182
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,390
actually doing quite successful they're

183
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:33,340
also a 30 percent makes you wonder

184
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:35,140
what's happening in Russia versus the

185
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:38,820
other country that Mako picked on this

186
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:38,820
morning which is trying to

187
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:42,670
but we're not covering enough alerts

188
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:44,080
because we are trying to do it ourselves

189
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:45,130
and we're trying to do it manually with

190
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:50,020
too many individual products and

191
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:51,700
consoles to deal with so he also made

192
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,650
another I actually really enjoyed Miko's

193
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,240
keynote this morning I thought it was

194
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:56,830
you know really interesting caused you

195
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,080
to you might not agree with everything

196
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:01,810
he says and this is one example of one

197
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,099
thing I don't necessarily agree with but

198
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:05,380
it certainly caused you to stop and

199
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,520
rethink how we sort of go about things

200
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:08,080
and that's what these conferences are

201
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:11,109
all about causing you to rethink and

202
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,580
revalue and retest some of the you know

203
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:17,080
commitments and strategies that you've

204
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:18,370
actually taken so Mikko talked about you

205
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,260
know you don't need to have the very

206
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:22,540
best security in the world you don't

207
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:24,849
have to have you know the Fort Knox of

208
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:26,320
security you just need to have more

209
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:28,240
security than the kind of the person

210
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,620
next to you because they'll go after the

211
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,610
easy targets the low-hanging fruit

212
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,790
memory who's saying that

213
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:35,170
so I you know good analogy you know you

214
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:36,880
don't need to swim faster than a shark

215
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:38,800
you just need to swim faster than the

216
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,950
guy next to you but what if there are

217
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,650
two sharks or how many sharks you're

218
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:47,920
going to allow for so while I agree you

219
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:50,229
don't need to build Fort Knox it's very

220
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,390
difficult to work out you know you can't

221
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:54,400
be the least secure but then you can't

222
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:56,020
be Fort Knox so exactly how can you be

223
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,229
in there somewhere you're going to be

224
00:07:56,020 --> 00:08:00,820
thinking about this smartly and go it'll

225
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,800
you know don't go it alone is a great

226
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,990
way of thinking about it you get paid by

227
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,420
the photo you take or you're going crazy

228
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,820
I didn't think I was that good-looking

229
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:12,300
my mum thinks so but my children are

230
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:15,040
assuring me I'm not cool or good-looking

231
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,120
this is the security maturity model so

232
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:19,600
we'll actually be referring to this

233
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,640
several times in the next few minutes so

234
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,930
basically how it works it's coming like

235
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,810
the evolution of security as well down

236
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:28,270
the bottoms firewall AV ids/ips email

237
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:31,090
web gateways etc and at the top so

238
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:33,280
protect technologies detect respond

239
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:35,289
technologies okay a different way of

240
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,699
actually laying it out we can definitely

241
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:38,199
get you copies of all these for those

242
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,240
that are frantically taking photos apart

243
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,430
from my good friend down here okay so

244
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:47,320
what's your current state in terms of

245
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:49,510
this so like than this model think about

246
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,370
where you are and this hopefully you'll

247
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,750
kind of up around here somewhere the

248
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:54,640
organizations that we mainly do

249
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,830
with that Optus you know obviously we're

250
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,449
Trustwave and Optus company so Optus

251
00:08:56,830 --> 00:09:00,280
certainly deal with you know larger

252
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:02,740
organizations they're certainly up

253
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,900
around here and their maturity model

254
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,460
doing pretty well but one of the biggest

255
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:08,439
issue is you have in the marketplace is

256
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:10,390
how do we keep all this how do we help

257
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:14,140
the stragglers keep up stragglers are

258
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:15,910
down here right paying the price as a

259
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:18,250
market we need to be working out how we

260
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:20,020
can make it easier for them to keep up

261
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,850
and get up to where they need to be we

262
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:24,370
need to work out how we can take these

263
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:26,440
you know enterprise class technologies

264
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:28,120
that are very useful and get them down

265
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,410
market and accessible to the

266
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:33,060
organizations that are struggling to

267
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:35,500
keep up does that make sense and that

268
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:36,849
actually is a really good way of summing

269
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,430
up what a managed security services

270
00:09:36,850 --> 00:09:40,900
provider should be doing and it's a

271
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:43,410
great way to measure maybe some of the

272
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:48,100
partners that you're working with

273
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:52,630
so where did MSS start from who

274
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:55,540
remembers outsourcing okay showing our

275
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:56,890
age right so outsourcing was this and I

276
00:09:55,540 --> 00:10:00,130
used to be on the receiving end of

277
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:02,710
outsourcing and working at a customer

278
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:05,160
that had a big outsourced contract with

279
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:07,180
a company who shall remain nameless

280
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,270
unless you buy me a drink later and I'm

281
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:12,099
happy to tell you they're out sources

282
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:14,050
and contracts were bizzarre right it

283
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,520
kind of seemed to me is a technician and

284
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:17,589
that's what we used to be called right

285
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,150
used to be called technicians all right

286
00:10:17,589 --> 00:10:20,680
seemed to me like the outsourcing

287
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:21,910
company had more lawyers and then they

288
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,949
had people that could actually do things

289
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:25,630
for me because every time I requested

290
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:27,010
something they were back to the contract

291
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:28,380
with the magnifying glass to work out

292
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:31,380
whether they should be doing it or not

293
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:34,210
right that is the wrong reaction and

294
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:36,430
every time I needed something slightly

295
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:37,780
new or different done it was back - oh

296
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:40,930
that's outside the scope of the contract

297
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:42,250
so you're gonna have to pay more he's

298
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:44,920
multi millions of dollars per year for

299
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:47,770
in the first place that was outsourcing

300
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:51,400
you think about applying the outsourcing

301
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:54,069
thought or process to security imagine

302
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:56,800
how awful that would be so luckily it's

303
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:59,020
evolved then we get into you know a sock

304
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,609
and the first security operation centers

305
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,170
were basically a bunch of screens the

306
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:03,580
more screens you had the better the

307
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:05,860
bigger they were you had all the big

308
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:06,370
flashy ones on the walls etc fantastic

309
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,990
or

310
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:10,630
exciting how much value were actually

311
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,890
getting out you look at these sorts of

312
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:13,870
environments now and you think about

313
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:15,850
they've got a screen per product that's

314
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,290
what the problem is so if you look at a

315
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,180
sock and the fewer screens they've got

316
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:21,969
probably the better the more automated

317
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:25,209
and orchestrated they are instead of

318
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:27,580
having multiple screens right I was up

319
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:29,380
on our head office last week and we've

320
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,720
just built this flash new fusion Center

321
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:33,520
thing but man they're monitors I don't

322
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,680
know how big they are they're like 60

323
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:37,510
something inches they're about that tall

324
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,650
and there's this big curved thing but

325
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:39,370
you wouldn't know where to look it's

326
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:41,079
amazing

327
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:42,970
that was the biggest thing I took out of

328
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,390
the our brand new Security Operations

329
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:47,650
Center is how cool the monitors were

330
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:49,630
maybe not quite the the piece that

331
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:51,310
they're expecting but there you go and

332
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:52,510
then we got into themes so instead of

333
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,920
having all these point products of all

334
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:55,240
these consoles to look at and all these

335
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,949
reports to try and make care to towel

336
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,500
off let's at least get all that data

337
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:01,510
into one place let's try and start doing

338
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:04,720
some correlation of that data this is a

339
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:06,520
good step forward so seems and manage

340
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,310
teams etc started really adding some

341
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,529
value to organizations this helps you

342
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:13,060
put up with the you know the 50-plus

343
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:14,470
vendors or individual products you might

344
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,599
be using inside your environments and

345
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,830
then we're kind of in the middle here

346
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,270
somewhere right

347
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:21,070
and of course I couldn't find a red one

348
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:23,550
but this is I thought this blue one

349
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:26,490
actually spelled out really well

350
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:28,479
security security operations platforms

351
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:30,790
so if you look at the big banks etc

352
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,140
those sorts of organizations they have

353
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:33,760
these really cool security operations

354
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:36,490
platforms that basically everything

355
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,170
integrates into that so think of the

356
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:40,300
seam as like you know this is monitoring

357
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:41,589
only this is going to tell you when you

358
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:43,329
have a massive problem it's not going to

359
00:12:41,589 --> 00:12:46,240
necessarily tell you what to do or how

360
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:48,010
to do it it's gonna say oh here's alert

361
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:50,140
you're pretty screwed over here good

362
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,910
luck probably won't even say good luck

363
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:53,860
but anyway and then you go off and try

364
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,939
and work out how to fix it these sorts

365
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:59,500
of environments where we need to try and

366
00:12:54,940 --> 00:13:02,230
get to need to be you know not only the

367
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,930
monitoring but also the response side so

368
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:06,400
not only detect but also response okay

369
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:08,500
that themes coming through many many

370
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:09,910
times so this is where your

371
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:12,279
orchestration and automation starts

372
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:13,900
coming in right the more you can

373
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:16,060
automate inside your environments the

374
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:18,310
better you think about I've taken an

375
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:19,459
email security example so you've got a

376
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,649
domain that

377
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,970
is spewing out whatever and you want to

378
00:13:21,649 --> 00:13:23,990
black this debt to Maine how long is

379
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,510
it's going to take you to log into your

380
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:29,930
email you know security platform and add

381
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:32,180
the domain to a blacklist how long two

382
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:33,410
minutes three minutes if you know what

383
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:36,439
you're doing remember what your login

384
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:39,589
was right but if that was orchestrated

385
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,330
then the you know it's screwed operators

386
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:43,279
platforms saying right we need to black

387
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:45,230
this domain across any external

388
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:48,020
accessing environment that's blacklister

389
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,980
automated go there's no way you're ever

390
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,899
going to be able to compete with that

391
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:53,149
all right it's gonna be responding in

392
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:57,440
seconds not minutes and that's where we

393
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:57,950
need to get to MSS that at the same

394
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,450
place

395
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:01,580
taja is going to use this several times

396
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:04,220
firewall Xavi's that's the first sort of

397
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:05,779
stuff that we started doing so I'm gonna

398
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,980
introduce one of the two terms that I

399
00:14:05,779 --> 00:14:10,850
really want you to take away from the

400
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:12,380
session commodity MSS so that's where

401
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:14,450
this is historically where we've come

402
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:16,580
from right we've been helping you do all

403
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:18,620
the boring stuff we've been helping you

404
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:20,029
sort of take that off your plate so you

405
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:22,580
can concentrate the more interesting

406
00:14:20,029 --> 00:14:23,810
newer technologies the flashy shiny

407
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,890
silver bullets that you know if you

408
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:27,290
don't buy it the world's about to stop

409
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:29,029
spinning apparently okay so we do all

410
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:32,360
the commodities stuff for your firewall

411
00:14:29,029 --> 00:14:33,709
desktop AV IPS IDs all the sort of

412
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,100
boring stuff the stuff that needs to be

413
00:14:33,709 --> 00:14:40,339
done

414
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:42,830
commodity MSS but have amendment men but

415
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:45,200
then the map so this is the latest

416
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:47,089
Gartner Magic Quadrant just for at least

417
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:48,140
several you weeks ago so pretty

418
00:14:47,089 --> 00:14:51,020
interesting there's only fourteen

419
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:52,550
vendors on this list how many men are

420
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,750
security service providers do you think

421
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:57,890
there are in the world just fourteen

422
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,980
obviously announcer below fourteen means

423
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:02,750
that you need to go and get a coffee

424
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:05,300
there's thousands there's niche players

425
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:07,220
there's massive companies a lot bigger

426
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:08,540
than something well not maybe not all

427
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:10,279
the there's some big companies on that

428
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:12,439
list you know there's companies that

429
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:15,200
aren't on this list but very large

430
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:17,089
organizations much larger than majority

431
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,529
the ones here but the inclusion criteria

432
00:15:17,089 --> 00:15:21,230
for major Koerner is actually pretty

433
00:15:18,529 --> 00:15:24,140
severe right really this is a very good

434
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:25,459
reading you know gotten to define the

435
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,779
actual Magic Quadrant and the other

436
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:28,520
thing to look at is how they actually

437
00:15:26,779 --> 00:15:32,390
define the inclusion criteria in that

438
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:33,230
Magic Quadrant okay now since we paid

439
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,060
for the session

440
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:36,200
advert Alain hope you're paying

441
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:41,239
attention this is for you

442
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:43,060
here's Trustwave right here we're pretty

443
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,020
I joke about it but we are pretty proud

444
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,209
there's not where we started we're the

445
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:48,590
only vendor that's actually moving on

446
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:50,120
the metro quadrant right now and we're

447
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:51,950
moving because of our innovation and

448
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:55,250
funnily enough that's the other term

449
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:57,230
we're gonna win okay so what's table

450
00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:00,440
stakes that's that today in terms of

451
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:02,500
managed security services the markets

452
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,060
growing eleven percent year on year

453
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:07,030
which is great

454
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:09,979
forty seven point six billion by 2023

455
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:13,310
globally okay so it's a big market place

456
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:17,000
seems everybody's doing MDR managed to

457
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:20,060
detection and response managed detection

458
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,070
and response detection response coming

459
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,810
through again so now the managed

460
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:25,310
security set providers are doing it for

461
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:28,430
you which is pretty interesting

462
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:30,619
but there's MDR and there's MDR so be

463
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:33,709
careful what you're looking at it is all

464
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:35,510
threat hunting equal when you start

465
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:38,600
seeing you know automated threat hunting

466
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:41,240
tools come out maybe I've been in this

467
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:43,700
industry a little too long but I can't

468
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:46,010
for the life of me equate an automated

469
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:47,420
threat hunting tool with just an ounce

470
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,700
of someone that knows what they're doing

471
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,380
someone who's had their boots in the

472
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:54,260
game for a long time and they just know

473
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:56,510
the tricks alright no AI and m/l is all

474
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:57,650
very exciting technologies and pretty

475
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,760
much just about every vendor in the

476
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:02,120
marketplace gets them completely

477
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:03,459
confused the mixed up but anyway be

478
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:06,079
careful what you're replacing with what

479
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:06,560
commodity activity absolutely can be

480
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:09,050
automated

481
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:11,030
the highly specialist stuff that's where

482
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:14,990
the human value still is incredibly

483
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:19,010
important soraa's talk of the town who

484
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:26,530
knows what saw stands for stands for SOA

485
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:26,530
are you have to speak up

486
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:33,309
security or security orchestration

487
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:35,889
automation and response hooking all this

488
00:17:33,309 --> 00:17:38,139
stuff together so those 50 products

489
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,559
you've got all talking together what's

490
00:17:38,139 --> 00:17:40,178
that

491
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,529
security operations platform it's the

492
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:42,759
beginnings of one you may not have

493
00:17:41,529 --> 00:17:44,110
stamped you know you stamped it with

494
00:17:42,759 --> 00:17:46,389
that name yet but that's what you're

495
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:49,149
starting to evolve and that's we mean to

496
00:17:46,389 --> 00:17:50,649
get to because the automation behind

497
00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:53,110
this is going to react a lot quicker

498
00:17:50,649 --> 00:17:54,850
than we can and the orchestration behind

499
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:57,248
this is going to make everything talk

500
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:59,949
together the more stuff that's talking

501
00:17:57,249 --> 00:18:00,549
together the less work I have to do that

502
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:05,499
sounds good

503
00:18:00,549 --> 00:18:07,360
okay you know data needs to be tracked

504
00:18:05,499 --> 00:18:09,909
and it's very important but certainly

505
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,709
you know the whole big evolution of

506
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:13,179
darts today is definitely changed a lot

507
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:14,409
to what it used to be you know used to

508
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:16,990
have server huggers then you had your

509
00:18:14,409 --> 00:18:18,549
you know your data huggers not sharing

510
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:20,350
anything you know everything is shared

511
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:22,240
today across the actual marketplace and

512
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:23,949
one of the big issues you know good

513
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:29,350
people are very hard to find and very

514
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:32,860
hard or harder to keep this is what I

515
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:34,269
think is really interesting analogy to

516
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,899
what we're doing right now is anyone

517
00:18:34,269 --> 00:18:39,129
read this book business for business

518
00:18:36,899 --> 00:18:40,418
okay they're not gonna tell you whatever

519
00:18:39,129 --> 00:18:42,459
I want cuz no one hears read the book

520
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:44,169
and you're just assume it's true I've

521
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,490
actually given this book so my work in

522
00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:47,470
product management right I have a

523
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:51,429
product management team I've given my

524
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:53,529
team this book to read as homework and

525
00:18:51,429 --> 00:18:55,330
homework since high school kind of went

526
00:18:53,529 --> 00:18:56,769
down in several ways but everybody's

527
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:58,570
read the book the interesting thing

528
00:18:56,769 --> 00:19:00,610
about it is it has these different

529
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:03,279
levels of supplier level one through to

530
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:04,779
level four right and then they draw

531
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:06,610
these analogies with all these different

532
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:09,070
industries but you look at what we're

533
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:12,668
doing right now so level one basic

534
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:15,549
supplier box dropper outsourcer all I

535
00:19:12,669 --> 00:19:17,919
want is your money I've got your money I

536
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:19,240
do not care I do know I don't care what

537
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,220
value you're getting out of that product

538
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:23,409
I've got my money I'm gone I'm on to the

539
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:25,570
next sucker that's that's what they

540
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:26,799
define is a level one supply and I think

541
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,460
outsourcing contracts are a great

542
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,429
example of that

543
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:32,740
level two supplier or okay I care a bit

544
00:19:30,429 --> 00:19:34,029
more now because in a year's time or

545
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:37,509
three years time I've got to renewal I

546
00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:39,220
want so suddenly you know you know six

547
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,419
months out from the new you know we're

548
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,489
all vendors a pretty

549
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:45,100
guilty of this suddenly you're my best

550
00:19:42,489 --> 00:19:47,489
friend again haven't heard from me for a

551
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:52,449
year and a half two years suddenly I

552
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:53,739
remember me renewals coming up so I'm

553
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,639
starting to care a little bit more about

554
00:19:53,739 --> 00:19:56,999
the value you're getting out of the

555
00:19:54,639 --> 00:20:01,748
product all right

556
00:19:56,999 --> 00:20:03,580
level three kind of where so maybe we

557
00:20:01,749 --> 00:20:04,720
want to resign this level three is kind

558
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,899
of where your manage security services

559
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:10,119
are now where she do care we see it's a

560
00:20:07,899 --> 00:20:11,768
bit of a partnership we want the

561
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:13,600
contract we want the renewal we're

562
00:20:11,769 --> 00:20:14,889
trying to give you some value and we're

563
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,830
trying to do as much as we can but you

564
00:20:14,889 --> 00:20:19,899
know we have technology ceilings as well

565
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:21,879
the Nirvana is the future state level

566
00:20:19,899 --> 00:20:25,779
four so this is where you're basically

567
00:20:21,879 --> 00:20:28,178
doing outcome as a service so what

568
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:29,889
outcome do you want to buy this is not

569
00:20:28,179 --> 00:20:31,149
about you know it and managed email

570
00:20:29,889 --> 00:20:33,129
security it's not about managed web

571
00:20:31,149 --> 00:20:35,139
security it's not about you know MBR or

572
00:20:33,129 --> 00:20:36,459
whatever the latest you know fancy

573
00:20:35,139 --> 00:20:38,979
acronyms are we're pushing out at you

574
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:41,109
this is basically saying you know my

575
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,850
organization wants to be secure and I

576
00:20:41,109 --> 00:20:45,129
want to partner with you and if it's not

577
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:46,178
secure you've got as much you know to

578
00:20:45,129 --> 00:20:48,039
pay for were here as I do

579
00:20:46,179 --> 00:20:49,269
we have a common goal we're working in

580
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:51,970
this as a partnership that's what

581
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:53,470
outcome as a service is all about your

582
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:55,210
relationship between your managed

583
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:58,659
security service provider will change

584
00:20:55,210 --> 00:21:01,840
dramatically over what it is today okay

585
00:20:58,659 --> 00:21:03,070
it's a really interesting book it's

586
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,840
about the only business book I've ever

587
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,889
read in my life normally I'm reading

588
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:09,730
Wilbur Smith and things like that

589
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:11,199
this one actually I enjoyed okay

590
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:14,230
it's driven to some of the global threat

591
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,820
data so this is global has just been

592
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:18,519
released it's all on the Trustwave Khan

593
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:20,320
website so one small thing here Asia

594
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:23,679
Pacific which is our master region

595
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:30,749
you know compromises increased 5% mmm

596
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:33,879
okay kind of interesting email attacks

597
00:21:30,749 --> 00:21:38,019
spam went back up again no it's

598
00:21:33,879 --> 00:21:39,330
interesting 2017 went down to 36% 2018

599
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:41,169
up to 45%

600
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:44,220
whoop-dee-doo which is probably what

601
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:46,600
most people are thinking I kind of agree

602
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:48,129
you know spam is one of these things

603
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,369
that hopefully is a tick box item now

604
00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:53,408
now this is another great opportunity to

605
00:21:51,369 --> 00:21:55,030
extract myself from being an Australian

606
00:21:53,409 --> 00:21:57,310
because I am from news

607
00:21:55,030 --> 00:22:00,399
for some reason in Australia the most

608
00:21:57,310 --> 00:22:04,780
common type of spam is basically phony

609
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:06,310
dating websites and services while your

610
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:08,560
mind is boggling about what a dating

611
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:10,300
service could be and how we've

612
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:11,379
categorized that and I must actually go

613
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,210
and find out what the official

614
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:14,100
categorization is what is it with you

615
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:18,160
people

616
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:22,060
39% of all spam is dating related 10%

617
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:25,090
and spam was sextortion scam emails bit

618
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:30,480
of a concern the attackers aren't stupid

619
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:34,870
they will chase what is working okay

620
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:37,690
now interestingly in New Zealand job

621
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:40,330
spam was actually the most popular it's

622
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:43,350
kind of weird and in the u.s. no great

623
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:45,220
prize for working out that

624
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:48,100
pharmaceuticals were actually the most

625
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:51,100
popular especially the well-known one

626
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:53,110
that starts with v nothing being said

627
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,209
against you know the morality of the

628
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:56,830
American race at all but anyone here but

629
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:58,960
for some reason it's the most popular

630
00:22:56,830 --> 00:23:00,699
type of spam in the US but here in

631
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,770
Australia it's all about dating spam so

632
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:05,440
clearly you've sorted the V site stuff

633
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:08,500
out and now you're into you know getting

634
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,780
your value for money maybe okay let's

635
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:14,730
move swiftly on from my marketing lady

636
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:17,260
at the back kills over with concern

637
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:19,360
percentage of spam that was actually

638
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:20,500
sorry malware that was in spam dropped

639
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,959
from twenty six down to six percent

640
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,940
which is pretty interesting and then

641
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,740
March the office documents were the most

642
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:30,970
popular type of attachment when it came

643
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:33,370
to malicious email and there's the other

644
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:35,200
types of malware attachments sorry file

645
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:37,659
attachments that we're in malicious spam

646
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,520
for those who haven't read them but this

647
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:41,530
is a bit that concerns me these are the

648
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,160
most common seen vulnerabilities when

649
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:47,310
we're looking at malicious spam if we're

650
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:51,460
all doing our jobs properly

651
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:53,409
how can a vulnerability from 2014 be the

652
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:55,000
second-most seen vulnerability that

653
00:23:53,410 --> 00:23:58,660
we're seeing through through malicious

654
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,040
spam because I don't continue using

655
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,520
things that aren't working they're not

656
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,740
stupid

657
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,660
they continue moving you know using

658
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:07,570
vulnerabilities and things that are

659
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:08,169
working methods that are working at

660
00:24:07,570 --> 00:24:10,539
vulnerable

661
00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:12,609
from 2014 second most popular

662
00:24:10,539 --> 00:24:16,840
vulnerability being seen in malicious

663
00:24:12,609 --> 00:24:18,100
spam that's a concern BC business email

664
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,869
compromised whether you want to call it

665
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:23,320
spear phishing CEO fraud whatever you

666
00:24:19,869 --> 00:24:24,789
want to call it we call it BC as it

667
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,249
suddenly made email security interesting

668
00:24:24,789 --> 00:24:28,480
again right so for the last seven or

669
00:24:27,249 --> 00:24:31,570
eight years you've been rusted on to

670
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,159
whoever you are using spans been going

671
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:35,320
pretty well malicious spam was kind of

672
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:36,730
behaving itself you know I had fire so I

673
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,960
was fighting elsewhere I just kept on

674
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:40,269
renewing it because it wasn't really

675
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,039
causing me problems right so then I'm

676
00:24:40,269 --> 00:24:44,190
migrated to office 365 would be one of

677
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:47,710
the reasons why you re looked at your

678
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:51,489
email security or you've been smashed by

679
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:53,769
BC emails and then obviously if you've

680
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:55,989
gone to office 365 then actually you

681
00:24:53,769 --> 00:24:57,460
might be having this issue now because

682
00:24:55,989 --> 00:24:59,409
it's actually one of the worst

683
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:01,989
performing solutions when it comes to BC

684
00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:04,690
but the problem with BC is it's a very

685
00:25:01,989 --> 00:25:06,850
low volume targeted attack against an

686
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:08,529
organization how well is a volumetric

687
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:10,449
you know spam engine going to really

688
00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:12,399
perform against that and that's what's

689
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:15,570
been causing angst and a lot of

690
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:18,668
organizations big and small all right

691
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:21,279
this is actually the most well issues

692
00:25:18,669 --> 00:25:23,200
from BC at least for people that will

693
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:26,340
admit it this is the big biggest reason

694
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,679
why we're gaining customers right now

695
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:32,259
the having a quality engine that is able

696
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,330
to address this attack in particular is

697
00:25:32,259 --> 00:25:35,889
critically important a lot more

698
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:37,840
important than having flashy marketing

699
00:25:35,889 --> 00:25:40,269
videos on your website so be careful the

700
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,759
vendors you're using okay BC is very

701
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:45,190
real at least user education is

702
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:48,460
critically important from an Australian

703
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:51,129
viewpoint the latest type of BC attack

704
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:52,989
we've seen here is payroll scam so this

705
00:25:51,129 --> 00:25:55,480
is where the email goes for it to the

706
00:25:52,989 --> 00:25:57,309
payroll administrator address from the

707
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:59,859
CEO basically saying hey I've changed my

708
00:25:57,309 --> 00:26:02,168
bank how do I go about changing my

709
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:04,090
payroll details and because it's from

710
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:05,919
the CEO that poor little payroll

711
00:26:04,090 --> 00:26:07,509
administrator I shouldn't say what the

712
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,669
payroll administrator probably thinks oh

713
00:26:07,509 --> 00:26:10,869
it's still easy for them I won't send

714
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:12,549
them the form or send them to some

715
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:14,049
complicated website you just give me a

716
00:26:12,549 --> 00:26:15,970
bank details I'll do it for you

717
00:26:14,049 --> 00:26:19,359
which is exactly what they're looking

718
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:20,859
for because it isn't the CEOs new bank

719
00:26:19,359 --> 00:26:21,480
account that the money is going into is

720
00:26:20,859 --> 00:26:23,070
the

721
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,679
his bank account that's going into and

722
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:27,389
the firstly CEO knows is when his you

723
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:30,090
know why credit card starts bouncing all

724
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:32,730
over town it's not a great thing we've

725
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:35,340
seen this remarkably popular and very

726
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:36,660
successful in the field the other one

727
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,309
globally that's actually doing the

728
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:40,530
rounds right now so payroll scam

729
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:42,750
absolutely here in Australia is causing

730
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:45,690
bit of a issue right now globally it's

731
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:47,130
giftcards as the email from you know

732
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:50,700
someone senior saying hey can you just

733
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:52,559
pop down to Target and pick up a bunch

734
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:55,940
of gift cards so I can use them for

735
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:58,860
whatever reason and send them here

736
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:59,910
pretty innocuous simple sort of sounding

737
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:03,809
requests it catches a lot of

738
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:09,600
organizations out BC is a big issue with

739
00:27:03,809 --> 00:27:11,428
a lot of organizations some of the web

740
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,559
stats they're actually seeing it's all

741
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:15,480
about crypto jacking and that coin

742
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:18,389
mining and that's basically what we're

743
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:21,210
seeing there massive issues globally

744
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:22,650
around this certainly something to be

745
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:26,850
aware of and make sure that your web

746
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:28,470
security solutions are across this what

747
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:31,889
about at the board so this is actually

748
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:33,120
from the World Economic Forum 2018 now

749
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:35,540
last time I checked the World Economic

750
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,709
Forum was not an IT security vendor

751
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:39,750
right this is sort of information that

752
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:41,400
your board or your CFO's etc are

753
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,970
actually reading this is pretty

754
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,590
interesting

755
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:45,960
suddenly cyber attacks of data theft or

756
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:48,449
fraud in the top ten numbers three and

757
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:51,090
four no longer do we need to teach our

758
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:52,860
board how to spell cyber now we need to

759
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:59,580
be saying what we're doing about it has

760
00:27:52,860 --> 00:28:01,199
changed the discussion quite a bit this

761
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:03,870
I think is one of the biggest conundrums

762
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,040
in the marketplace right now how are you

763
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:08,040
going to do all this stuff and obviously

764
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,030
the theme of this conference right how

765
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,740
are you going to select which ones

766
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:12,990
you're going to do how are you going to

767
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,460
cover the ones that you can't do do you

768
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:16,710
want to be a specialist and certain

769
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:20,240
areas or do you want to be you know a

770
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:25,860
master of none that's a big problem

771
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:29,490
malware expert or data scientist data

772
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:30,928
scientist are the most growing job

773
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:33,140
category when it comes to cyber security

774
00:28:30,929 --> 00:28:34,190
positions right now

775
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:35,750
so if you're looking for a career change

776
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:38,000
or looking for something to do or giving

777
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:42,679
some advice maybe to your children data

778
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,000
scientists pretty interesting far more

779
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:46,429
than being able to reverse-engineer

780
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,590
malware professional education versus

781
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:50,590
real hands-on experience we're all going

782
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:52,280
to have our different opinions there

783
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:54,860
you're never going to learn everything

784
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:55,610
from scratch from being in the field but

785
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,719
then you're never going to learn

786
00:28:55,610 --> 00:29:01,040
everything that you're going to need to

787
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:03,610
know at the coalface in a classroom it's

788
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,740
a difficult thing product expert versus

789
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:09,559
scripting an orchestration expert

790
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:11,360
there's another interesting area dad

791
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:11,960
should I be a web developer or should I

792
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,030
do

793
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:17,230
scripting and orchestration scripting an

794
00:29:14,030 --> 00:29:19,160
illustration person absolutely

795
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:20,540
orchestration and automation within

796
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,549
those solutions is going to become

797
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:24,159
critically important as are the skills

798
00:29:22,549 --> 00:29:33,679
to be able to up these things together

799
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:37,010
make sense okay so if you were around

800
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:39,230
here somewhere and our security maturity

801
00:29:37,010 --> 00:29:41,450
model may be relying on a man that maybe

802
00:29:39,230 --> 00:29:42,770
they're maybe not using MSS for some of

803
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:43,040
the commodity activity you might be

804
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:46,639
doing

805
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:48,980
how can you leapfrog yourself up the

806
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,950
chain you don't need to do every single

807
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:53,690
one of these yourself partner work out

808
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:54,770
the best way to partner maybe MSS is not

809
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:57,559
quite for you but there's lots of

810
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:59,179
options out in the marketplace because

811
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:01,040
this is the interesting thing about MSS

812
00:29:59,179 --> 00:30:04,309
we're kind of playing in two different

813
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:05,510
areas of the security maturity model so

814
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:08,178
it's one of those lines at squeaking

815
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:11,780
apparently they also clean the laptop

816
00:30:08,179 --> 00:30:16,549
screen it's quite useful so innovative

817
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:17,720
MSS or commodity MSS or a mix of two so

818
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:20,240
if you want to leapfrog

819
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:22,210
up that maturity level definitely

820
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,350
innovative enemy SS can help you do it

821
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:27,770
because these are the sorts of offerings

822
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:30,889
there we go

823
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:32,389
slide build these sorts of offerings

824
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:33,799
that are now coming out from the leading

825
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:36,530
managed security service providers

826
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:38,210
manage detection and threat response MDR

827
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:39,950
type technologies proactive threat

828
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:42,620
hunting doing all this activity for you

829
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:45,230
you don't need to be the expert but then

830
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:46,550
you also it's like an ala carte menu so

831
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:47,030
if you have a particular interest and a

832
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:49,820
special

833
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:50,889
in a certain area fantastic knock

834
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:53,060
yourself out

835
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,890
supplement areas where you're not where

836
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:59,200
you do not have coverage by partnering

837
00:30:54,890 --> 00:31:03,920
don't go to lone make sense

838
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:07,780
alright bit of a taster the other area

839
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:10,040
that MSS is going is an accessibility

840
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:12,320
what happens if you're out at the shops

841
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:14,300
or at lunch major issues that happens

842
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,970
maybe you need to update a whitelist

843
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:18,530
maybe you need to log a an incident

844
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:20,870
maybe your managed security provider

845
00:31:18,530 --> 00:31:24,020
needs your authorization to react to

846
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:25,250
some sort of high severity incident can

847
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:27,379
you really wait until you get back into

848
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,490
the office this information needs to get

849
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:31,130
to where you are and needs to be

850
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:34,670
available and usable by wherever you are

851
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:36,470
whenever that is so mobile applications

852
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:39,470
is certainly an area that I think is

853
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:42,620
very interesting so MSS is evolving in

854
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:44,630
two areas innovative solutions like MD

855
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:46,129
re and MD are in and those sorts of

856
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:47,990
technologies helping you get into more

857
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,860
of the detect and respond technologies

858
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,080
remember when you started off with that

859
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:52,909
in this graphic and the in that area is

860
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:55,010
accessibility to what I need it to do

861
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:57,610
accessibility for me to be able to use

862
00:31:55,010 --> 00:32:01,510
the tools and services that I'm getting

863
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:06,979
that I'm getting as part of that service

864
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:11,500
okay all right fantastic Tommy cuz

865
