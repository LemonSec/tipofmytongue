1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:04,500
we've got dr. mark Carrie Smith talking

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:06,330
about neuroscience positive psychology

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,010
in psychology and behavioral economics

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:10,379
which sounds like a really interesting

5
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:17,189
combination of topics to cover a four

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:20,609
InfoSec please welcome Arkin thank you

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:24,060
so after lunch on the last day my

8
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:26,130
expectations were reasonably low so I'm

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,240
sure you're all here to hear me not

10
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,680
because there was nothing else on

11
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,630
because you're just hanging around until

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,710
the prizes I believe what I want to

13
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:35,879
believe basically so first of all I

14
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,230
would like to acknowledge the

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,480
traditional owners of the land on which

16
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,360
we meet today the Younger Bay people I

17
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:44,250
pay my respects to elder's past present

18
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,260
and emerging for they hold the memories

19
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,700
the traditions the culture and hopes for

20
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,750
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander

21
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:53,610
people so the presentation today should

22
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:55,670
provide you with some interesting

23
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:58,230
information gleaned from the fields of

24
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:03,899
behavioral economics positive psychology

25
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:07,399
and neuroscience and that should help

26
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:10,170
you be a happier more insightful and

27
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,750
more productive people and information

28
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,250
security professionals usually during

29
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,680
presentations I'm happy to take

30
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,360
questions but I'm not sure how we're

31
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,270
going to go for time today so let's try

32
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,640
and save them until the end please and

33
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:25,830
if I say something really inspirational

34
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,180
and you are dying to speak to the person

35
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:31,369
next to you please try and repress that

36
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,369
and talk to them when I'm finished

37
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:38,460
procrastination I was going to start

38
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,280
with procrastination but I really don't

39
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,679
feel like it now we'll come back to that

40
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,329
later

41
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,490
there's an unfortunate attitude among

42
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:49,380
some information security professionals

43
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,780
and I'll just apologize right up front

44
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:54,119
for lack of the use of the c-word I'm

45
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,790
really struggling with that I'm a bit

46
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,560
old as you can see and I'm going to use

47
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,689
the term information security

48
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,619
professional or InfoSec just translate

49
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:06,000
to whatever makes more sense to you so

50
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:07,799
there's an unfortunate attitude among

51
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,318
some information security professionals

52
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,480
to blame users and ridicule them for

53
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,560
their choices and behavior rather than

54
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:19,049
trying to understand

55
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:21,420
why anyone seen this video yeah I've

56
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,370
seen it shared a lot usually with

57
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,799
accompanying ridiculing assumptions that

58
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:29,640
the people in this are really disguising

59
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:32,160
true passwords worst password lists a

60
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,958
very popular fodder very popular for

61
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:39,470
sites like LinkedIn and shared a lot

62
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:42,000
you've seen this one no interesting I

63
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:43,859
love a good hacker in hoodie photo this

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,080
one is particularly good not just a

65
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:51,000
hoodie but the weed mask ensemble as

66
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:54,150
well so recently the united kingdom's

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,250
national cyber security center and troy

68
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:58,849
hunt collaborated in releasing a list of

69
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:01,560
the 100 thousand most commonly found

70
00:02:58,849 --> 00:03:03,060
passwords in breached credentials i'm

71
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,849
sure we'll see this graphic a lot in the

72
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,410
next coming months the national cyber

73
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:09,540
security center has a lot of good

74
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:12,810
resources particularly on the topic of

75
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,160
awareness raising and culture they have

76
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:15,599
a really good sense of humor as well I

77
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,150
really like the the material they

78
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,780
produce included in the blog post for

79
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:23,400
the 100,000 password list is the quote

80
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:26,400
security works when people act as a

81
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:30,540
community now the phrase the information

82
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,069
security community is usually used in in

83
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,380
applying to people who work in the

84
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:36,450
industry but I think it would benefit us

85
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:38,670
to also think of the people that we need

86
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:42,119
to help protect information usually

87
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:44,970
referred to as users as being part of a

88
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,799
community as well it takes a village is

89
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,500
a phrase that's usually applied to

90
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,510
raising children but a village mindset

91
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,880
where people have empathy and compassion

92
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,290
and look after each other is important

93
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,200
for any community to function

94
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:00,269
effectively I feel more of a village

95
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:04,619
mindset in InfoSec would benefit all of

96
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:08,100
us the behavior change can be

97
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:10,819
challenging we all know that some people

98
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,819
more than others

99
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:16,079
quote the endowment effect is observed

100
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:17,970
when people feel endowed with a

101
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,739
particular artifact such that they are

102
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:22,349
reluctant to exchange it for any

103
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:24,900
substitute even if the substitute is

104
00:04:22,349 --> 00:04:26,920
superior unquote this comes from a

105
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:30,250
seminal paper by Kahneman

106
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:31,540
at all back in 1991 there are some

107
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,790
interesting quirks with the endowment

108
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:36,250
effect it appears to apply not just to

109
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:38,740
physical objects but to time and

110
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,900
intellectual property including points

111
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:43,480
of view and can be triggered before

112
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:46,510
something is acquired online options for

113
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,520
example the degree of a diamond appears

114
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:50,860
to be proportional to the effort

115
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,890
required to obtain the artifact and is

116
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:57,670
particularly associated with things we

117
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:59,440
built ourselves down early and Mike

118
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:05,740
Norton have described this as the IKEA

119
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:08,020
effect this paper how I create my

120
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,450
passwords or this is a very I create my

121
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:12,820
passwords it's a very interesting look

122
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:16,180
at endowment and how it may have an

123
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:18,159
impact upon change in behavior in this

124
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,470
case the change in behavior is trying to

125
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,780
encourage people to change how they

126
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:25,210
create their passwords the routines they

127
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,250
use for password creation it contains

128
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:29,739
some interesting conceptual theoretical

129
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:33,730
and methodological points and let's have

130
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:35,470
a look at a few of those so part of the

131
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:37,180
background for that paper are the

132
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:39,430
different factors that can contribute to

133
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:43,750
change resistance in people which

134
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:46,120
include perceives threat level self

135
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:48,880
hurting which is a propensity for people

136
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,820
to repeat past behaviors possibly due to

137
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,340
renewed a need for consistency or to

138
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,230
avoid cognitive dissonance people

139
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:58,000
generally like to consider themselves as

140
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,560
being responsible for positive changes

141
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,020
and positive outcomes rather than

142
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:04,210
negative ones to admit that an existing

143
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,460
behavior is suboptimal may include

144
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:10,450
acknowledging past mistakes and people

145
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:12,430
will often avoid this and then the last

146
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:14,890
factor that can contribute to change

147
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:17,070
resistance is information avoidance and

148
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:19,419
that's the idea that people avoid

149
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:22,060
information if it would require them to

150
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:24,040
change their beliefs to take undesired

151
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:27,310
actions will be likely to elicit

152
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,720
unpleasant emotions now all of those

153
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,070
things could be relevant when you think

154
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,780
about the advice and information

155
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:34,240
security people give to laypeople

156
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:36,130
if what you're telling them they

157
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,140
perceive is something which might hurt

158
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:39,070
their brains or make them feel bad or

159
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,960
give them bad news

160
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:42,880
then perhaps information of

161
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:45,880
as part of the reason that communication

162
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,430
can be difficult sometimes it's a

163
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:50,919
complicated situation password creation

164
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:52,960
and endowment and probably differs from

165
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:54,849
person to person the authors of this

166
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,830
paper just focus on endowment as one

167
00:06:54,849 --> 00:07:02,289
possible contributing factor to behavior

168
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:03,719
so Marcus and Roby introduced two theory

169
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:05,710
types useful for understanding

170
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,169
organizational change these can also be

171
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:11,770
applied to individual change and they

172
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:14,109
are variants and process theories so

173
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:15,729
variants theories focus is on the

174
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:19,360
conditions that are necessary and

175
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:21,449
sufficient for an outcome to occur in

176
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,160
this case we're talking about change a

177
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:26,770
habit in its classical definition is an

178
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:29,160
example of a variance theory the same Q

179
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:31,900
will always trigger the same behavior

180
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:34,330
Neil at all makes the point that quote

181
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,609
habitual behaviors are the default

182
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:39,008
behavior when people are unable or

183
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:42,759
unwilling to make effortful decisions

184
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:45,130
about how to behave if unquote when

185
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:47,289
someone is asked to change a habit they

186
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:50,139
are not considering equal effort options

187
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:52,509
they're being asked to switch to a more

188
00:07:50,139 --> 00:07:54,310
cognitively effortful behavior at least

189
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:59,110
in the short term this is sometimes

190
00:07:54,310 --> 00:08:00,880
called switching cost humans are

191
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,710
generally present focused and are more

192
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:06,610
likely to be influenced by present

193
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:07,750
effort than future benefit this reduces

194
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,840
the likelihood of behavior change

195
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:12,490
happening this is termed psychological

196
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,190
distance in the temporal dimension in

197
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:16,360
construal level theory incidentally

198
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:18,250
there are four dimensions in

199
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:20,020
psychological distance all relative to

200
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:22,780
the self it's an ego centric model

201
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,150
that's why it appeals to me probably so

202
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:27,159
the four dimensions are temporal takes

203
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:30,330
place further into the future

204
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:33,039
spatial occurs in a more remote location

205
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:36,130
social happens to people less and less

206
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:40,240
like oneself and hypothetical is less

207
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:42,338
likely to occur the greater

208
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:45,399
psychological distance the less concrete

209
00:08:42,339 --> 00:08:46,660
and more abstract a construct is this is

210
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,970
important when we are trying to

211
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:50,410
communicate abstract concepts such as

212
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:52,750
when attempting to influence risk

213
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:54,010
perception in non information security

214
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,870
professionals

215
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:59,019
this is particularly the case when the

216
00:08:55,870 --> 00:09:00,940
availability heuristic has an impact the

217
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:04,240
availability heuristic means that people

218
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:06,730
quote assess the frequency of a class or

219
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,250
the probability of an event by the ease

220
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:11,800
with which instances or occurrences can

221
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,660
be brought to mind and that's from a

222
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,380
seminal paper by Tversky and tournament

223
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:20,469
back in 1974 in decision-making

224
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:22,360
processes more available data that is

225
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:24,639
data which is more easily remembered

226
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:27,310
have more impact and hard to remember

227
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:29,079
data adding to the complexity of human

228
00:09:27,310 --> 00:09:30,939
behavioral change is the fact that we

229
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:33,459
are generally fairly poor at predicting

230
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:37,540
how we will feel in the future this is

231
00:09:33,459 --> 00:09:39,880
called effective forecasting so let's

232
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:41,680
talk about the letter Kiley specifically

233
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,420
the relative frequency of words in the

234
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,638
English language that have K as their

235
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:48,849
third letter as compared with words that

236
00:09:45,639 --> 00:09:50,560
begin with the letter K so hands up who

237
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:51,820
thinks there are more words in the

238
00:09:50,560 --> 00:10:02,138
English language that begin with the

239
00:09:51,820 --> 00:10:04,269
letter K hands up who thinks there are

240
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:08,050
more words that have K as their third

241
00:10:04,269 --> 00:10:09,190
letter hands up who can't be bothered to

242
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:14,139
put their hand up because they don't

243
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:15,790
like putting their hand up hands up

244
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:17,019
who's figured out why I'm asking this

245
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:19,149
question and they're actually answering

246
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:21,149
on that basis rather than their first

247
00:10:19,149 --> 00:10:24,010
impressions of what they really think

248
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:25,959
and one person is honest and - good good

249
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,069
so if that was the case and you were

250
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,109
just putting up your hand because you

251
00:10:27,069 --> 00:10:30,849
figured out what I was at why I was

252
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:32,740
asking that question that's a good

253
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:34,630
example of demand buyers where

254
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,760
participants form an interpretation of

255
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:40,089
the experiments purpose and change their

256
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:42,130
behavior to fit that impression so there

257
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:43,750
are actually about twice as many words

258
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,639
in the English language that have K is

259
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,839
their third letter but generally

260
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:48,750
speaking when you ask people this

261
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:51,459
question they answer it honestly and

262
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:54,040
they usually say there's more words that

263
00:10:51,459 --> 00:10:56,949
begin with K because it's easily brought

264
00:10:54,040 --> 00:11:00,370
to mind and that's a classic example of

265
00:10:56,949 --> 00:11:01,990
the availability heuristic so back to

266
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:04,930
Marcus and Roby and their theory types

267
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:06,710
now a process theories focus is on the

268
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:09,290
conditions under which outcomes

269
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:11,810
can occur but are not guaranteed to it

270
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:13,880
is more about the changes in states or

271
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:17,810
changes that can occur in leading to

272
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:20,720
outcomes cause precedes effect and makes

273
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:24,199
effect possible more cause does not

274
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:26,570
necessarily result in more effect effect

275
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,700
may not occur even if cause is present

276
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:31,130
and effects are influenced by social

277
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:35,510
phenomena which can be discontinuous and

278
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:37,880
emergent change readiness is a process

279
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:40,939
theory nor cross at all posit that

280
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:42,290
people inhabit stages of change and if

281
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:45,470
they're asked to change when they're not

282
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:47,150
ready to they simply won't sometimes

283
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:49,640
information security professionals are

284
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:52,040
confused why people with awareness of

285
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:54,319
best practice will not unflinchingly and

286
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,510
enthusiastically adopt that practice

287
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,540
such as with strong password creation

288
00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:01,460
advice the assumption appears to be

289
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:03,860
rooted in a variance theory that

290
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:07,550
knowledge as cause will always lead to

291
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:09,230
strong passwords as effect the same can

292
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:10,839
be seen in the assumption that awareness

293
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:13,160
of an information security policy

294
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:15,560
invariably leads to compliance with it

295
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,980
in both cases the knowledge is necessary

296
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:22,250
but not necessarily sufficient to bring

297
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:24,230
about change cognitive and cultural

298
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:26,450
biases influence risk perception and

299
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:28,430
security behavior which are more aligned

300
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:33,020
to a processed theory it's a much more

301
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:33,859
complicated situation so endowment

302
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:36,380
effect leads to the following

303
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:38,720
consequences over estimation of the

304
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,760
usefulness of the artifact over

305
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,250
estimation of the value of the artifact

306
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:47,090
and change unwillingness which is the

307
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:48,710
main outcome the password change

308
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:50,710
behavior study concluded that the

309
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:53,270
endowment effect does appear to change

310
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:56,480
resistance in password creation routines

311
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:58,460
and that studying endowment on other

312
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,540
areas of information security behavior

313
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:04,580
would be worthwhile such as backups

314
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:06,199
patching and phishing detection these

315
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:08,180
are all behaviors where people develop

316
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:11,270
their own habits and routines for how

317
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:12,859
they perform them it reiterates to me

318
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:15,500
the humans are very complex things

319
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,660
simple explanations for suboptimal user

320
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:20,590
behavior like people are lazy or stupid

321
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:28,400
are a mistake

322
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:35,840
who knows what this is it's good good

323
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:38,780
literal answer it is a garden yes very

324
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:41,510
good these are this is an example of a

325
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:43,520
desire line or a desire path and there

326
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:45,710
the past the people Forge for themselves

327
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:48,140
in order to reduce effort and increase

328
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:49,910
efficiency as information security

329
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:52,400
professionals we should keep these paths

330
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:54,709
in mind whenever we ask people to change

331
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:57,650
their behavior particularly when we are

332
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:59,180
creating or enforcing policy or changing

333
00:13:57,650 --> 00:14:02,840
the environment by implementing new

334
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:04,250
technology or systems non-compliance may

335
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:06,380
be a completely rational and

336
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:09,350
understandable behavior when we consider

337
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:11,150
all the factors involved creating and

338
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:13,130
encouraging open communication between

339
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:14,900
information security professionals and

340
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:17,990
the rest of the organizations they work

341
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:20,240
in is critical in understanding users

342
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:22,130
needs and frustrations and working

343
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,350
together to make information security

344
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:29,800
and empowering influence rather than a

345
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:31,790
pain in the bum the Craster nation

346
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,819
actually I still don't feel like oh

347
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:36,740
let's let's come back to it later

348
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:38,510
so positive psychology is a subfield of

349
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:41,480
psychology that came about in the late

350
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:44,120
1990s to change the focus of psychology

351
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:46,550
a definition from Christopher Peterson

352
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:49,370
is positive psychology is the scientific

353
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:53,180
study of what makes life most worth

354
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:55,100
living positive psychology focuses on

355
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:57,770
the positive events and influences in

356
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,950
people's lives including positive

357
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:03,439
experiences like happiness joy

358
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:06,260
inspiration and love positive states and

359
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:09,100
traits like gratitude resilience and

360
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:11,630
compassion and positive institutions

361
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,840
that is applying positive principles

362
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:15,890
within organizations and institutions

363
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,200
let's take a look at a couple of ideas

364
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:20,630
and tools from positive psychology that

365
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:24,280
I think can help us be more happier more

366
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:24,280
insightful and more productive

367
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:29,720
appreciative inquiry is a positive

368
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:31,610
psychology methodology that flips the

369
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,140
commonly used approach of identifying

370
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:36,140
and fixing problems

371
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:38,300
that is a focus on deficits to one of

372
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:40,459
identifying and amplifying what is

373
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:43,579
working well now or has previously

374
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:44,630
worked well it's an inherently positive

375
00:15:43,579 --> 00:15:48,260
and collaborative approach to

376
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:50,209
organizational change quote appreciative

377
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:53,660
inquiry is based on a deceptively simple

378
00:15:50,209 --> 00:15:55,459
premise organizations grow in the

379
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,680
direction of what they repeatedly asked

380
00:15:55,459 --> 00:16:03,050
questions about and focus their

381
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:05,510
attention on unquote appreciative

382
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:08,269
inquiry uses a five-step process model

383
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:11,720
one definition what you want to build

384
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:14,140
more of to discovery identifying and

385
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:18,769
appreciating the best of what is or was

386
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:22,180
three dream imagining what could be four

387
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:27,250
design determining what should be and

388
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:30,649
five delivery creating what will being

389
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:32,450
so appreciative inquiry is often used as

390
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:34,850
a behavioral change methodology but it

391
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:37,519
can be applied to individuals or teams

392
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:39,470
it's quite flexible so let's just think

393
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,810
about I'll ask you a series of questions

394
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:43,910
and I'd like you to think about each

395
00:16:41,810 --> 00:16:46,040
question in the context of your

396
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:49,899
professional life and just have a little

397
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:53,360
reflection on each question as I ask it

398
00:16:49,899 --> 00:17:00,470
when you feel engaged energized and

399
00:16:53,360 --> 00:17:01,820
enjoying life what's happening if you

400
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:04,549
could do what you've just thought about

401
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:10,790
more consistently what might be possible

402
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:13,220
as you look ahead how can you move from

403
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:19,428
where you are right now to where you

404
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:21,770
want to be if there was one action you

405
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:26,540
could take where would you be willing to

406
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:28,820
start so for some people this might be a

407
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,830
little example of job crafting where you

408
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,928
think about where you want your job to

409
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:34,549
be or where you'd like to go and then

410
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:37,030
think about what are the simple changes

411
00:17:34,549 --> 00:17:38,960
I can make to try and get to that point

412
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:41,000
that's obviously going to differ from

413
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,700
person to person but if you apply these

414
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,110
sort of simple questions in all areas of

415
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,519
your life it might lead to some

416
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:52,740
interesting

417
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:54,830
insights so what appreciative inquiry is

418
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:56,820
not it's not about ignoring problems

419
00:17:54,830 --> 00:18:00,240
problems are acknowledged but have

420
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:02,610
refrained as opportunities it's not

421
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,929
about only focusing on the positives I'm

422
00:18:02,610 --> 00:18:05,729
sure many of us have been in

423
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:07,950
organizational change meetings where no

424
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:10,919
one admit the truth and it's extremely

425
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:12,419
frustrating appreciative inquiry is

426
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:15,360
inherently collaborative and

427
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:17,970
participated as such it may not suit all

428
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,428
settings psychological safety is a

429
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:22,950
necessary prerequisite to ensure that

430
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:27,149
people feel able to tell their truth and

431
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:29,220
feel heard treating people with respect

432
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:31,979
and compassion doesn't mean you need to

433
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:34,139
say yes to everything being transparent

434
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,509
and open and providing context for

435
00:18:34,139 --> 00:18:38,668
decisions is important if you're wrong

436
00:18:36,509 --> 00:18:42,289
about something be prepared to be open

437
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:42,289
about it admit your mistakes

438
00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:45,990
appreciative inquiry can be a different

439
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,629
way of looking at how to improve

440
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:50,820
situations and as I said before it can

441
00:18:48,629 --> 00:18:54,809
be individual team based organizational

442
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:57,240
based so let's take another look at the

443
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:59,399
outcomes of the endowment effect they

444
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,440
are over estimation of the usefulness of

445
00:18:59,399 --> 00:19:03,000
the artifact over estimation of the

446
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,159
value of the artifact and change

447
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,590
unwillingness what if people were

448
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:09,960
endowed with good beliefs practices and

449
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:13,230
values and were unwilling to change away

450
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,909
from them one way to engender this could

451
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:16,830
be to engage the people that use the

452
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:19,409
systems that we implement and the

453
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:21,059
policies that we write and involve them

454
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:24,019
through meaningful collaboration and

455
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:26,820
co.design to activate that IKEA effect

456
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:28,350
this could result in those people being

457
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,450
endowed with the outcomes of the

458
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:32,850
collaboration giving them a strong sense

459
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:35,639
of ownership of the result which should

460
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:37,199
make everybody's lives easier this idea

461
00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:39,689
comes from the excellent podcast by

462
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,019
Bruce Hollis called rethinking the human

463
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,019
factor

464
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:50,620
there are many many studies in the

465
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:52,690
information security literature that

466
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:56,229
focus on users self reporting their

467
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:57,790
perception of risk the problem is such

468
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:00,000
measures are influenced by a number of

469
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:02,860
biases that reduce the findings validity

470
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,980
these biases include social desirability

471
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:09,520
bias subjectivity bias common methods

472
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:11,890
bias and demand bias many emotions that

473
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:14,650
are elemental to perceptions of risk

474
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:16,930
such as fear uncertainty and distrust

475
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:19,300
are at least partially experienced

476
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:21,220
subconsciously making them difficult to

477
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:24,669
accurately measure and difficult for

478
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:26,560
people to express honestly also many

479
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:29,260
studies into people's risk perceptions

480
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:32,379
are based on intention to behave rather

481
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:34,210
than actual behavior this is a problem

482
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,950
because people often describe their

483
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:38,020
concerns about information security if

484
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:40,390
you ask them but then later on don't

485
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:42,129
take actions to protect themselves this

486
00:20:40,390 --> 00:20:44,080
kind of wishful thinking is not limited

487
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:45,840
to information security of course it

488
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,550
happens in all areas of life

489
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:51,340
particularly around behaviors related to

490
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:53,440
health exercise and saving money

491
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:57,159
we have great intentions but we often

492
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,380
own follow through with them an

493
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,570
alternative to self reporting is to use

494
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:05,590
a method of direct neural measurement

495
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:06,850
such as electroencephalography or EEG to

496
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:09,669
measure events triggered by specific

497
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:12,909
stimuli or actions associated with

498
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:15,370
risk-taking behavior let's have a quick

499
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:17,110
look at one such study entitled using

500
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:19,719
measures of risk perception to predict

501
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:22,300
information security behavior insights

502
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:26,620
from electroencephalography by Vance and

503
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:28,540
Anderson Vance and Anderson used EEG to

504
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:31,209
measure participants responses to gains

505
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:33,790
and losses while undertaking the iowa

506
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:35,710
gambling task a widely used method in

507
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:37,960
psychology and neuroscience to study

508
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:41,050
decision-making and is useful for its

509
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:43,270
behavior or predictive value poor

510
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:46,090
performance on the iowa gambling task or

511
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:48,220
igt is strongly correlated with

512
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:50,560
real-world risky behavior such as

513
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:53,230
substance abuse compulsive gambling and

514
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:55,389
criminality strong associations have

515
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:58,000
also been found between igt performance

516
00:21:55,390 --> 00:22:00,610
and real-world sensation seeking

517
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,750
inhibition reward responsiveness fun

518
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:07,000
seeking and impulsivity savants and

519
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:08,350
Anderson started with a survey asking

520
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,180
their participants a variety of

521
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:12,550
questions to measure their general risk

522
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:14,380
tendency and other specific questions

523
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:16,450
about information security risk

524
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,550
perception including some measures

525
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:21,070
looking at perceived threat severity and

526
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:22,720
threat susceptibility and some measures

527
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:24,310
specifically looking at information

528
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:29,350
security risk perception as a broad

529
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:32,230
measure then they used igt using a EEG

530
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:33,909
to measure neural activity then they had

531
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:36,220
participants undertake an image

532
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:38,860
classification task which included

533
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,880
simulated security warnings and that was

534
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:42,310
designed to measure actual

535
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:45,430
decision-making behavior under an

536
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:47,440
information security risk condition this

537
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:51,930
was a test to measure security warning

538
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:54,250
disregard and finally a post-test survey

539
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:56,200
so the image classification task

540
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:58,600
involved participants visiting a series

541
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,610
of websites and rapidly identifying and

542
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:03,730
classifying images as either real or

543
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:05,770
cartoon the time taken and the accuracy

544
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:08,130
were both factors and that was to

545
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:10,540
simulate real-world working pressures

546
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:12,310
participants use their own laptops and

547
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:15,610
that was to simulate protecting their

548
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:18,159
own data the image classification task

549
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:19,899
was a ruse the actual test was to

550
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:23,440
measure how participants would respond

551
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:25,030
to the security warnings at periodic

552
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,370
intervals participants were shown a

553
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:29,440
security warning stating that the site

554
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:31,570
are attempting to visit appeared to

555
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:34,840
contain malware and asking them if they

556
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:36,639
wanted to proceed if they said no they

557
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,409
were penalized for failing to classify

558
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:40,630
that image and showing the next image

559
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:42,370
which simulated the productivity cost

560
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:44,860
that can occur with information security

561
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:47,739
controls if they said yes they were able

562
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:49,929
to proceed and classify the image the

563
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,730
EEG measures taken during that I of a

564
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:53,500
gambling task turned out to be a very

565
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:58,300
good predictor of this security warning

566
00:23:53,500 --> 00:24:00,550
disregard behavior approximately halfway

567
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,800
through the task participants were shown

568
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:04,389
a simulated security incident with a

569
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,820
full screen message saying that their

570
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:08,650
computer had been hacked the purpose of

571
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:11,189
the incident was to measure how

572
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:13,260
participants risk perceptions differed

573
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:15,150
between the pretest survey and the

574
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:17,610
post-test survey which was conducted

575
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:20,820
after the image classification task was

576
00:24:17,610 --> 00:24:22,469
completed the research has found that

577
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,659
self-reported measures of risk

578
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:27,270
perception before the incident or in

579
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:29,160
significant but the self-reported risk

580
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:31,470
perception measures taking after the

581
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:34,170
incident were almost identical to the

582
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:36,420
EEG measures this supports previous

583
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:38,580
research the many emotions such as fear

584
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:40,950
and uncertainty are not processed

585
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:43,620
consciously making them difficult to

586
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:45,150
measure through self reporting the

587
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:47,879
security incident appeared to make

588
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:50,190
information security risk salient in the

589
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:55,230
participants minds causing conscious

590
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:57,180
processing taking into account the small

591
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:59,040
sample of 62 participants and other

592
00:24:57,180 --> 00:25:02,400
limitations there are some takeaways in

593
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:04,050
this study for us self-reported risk

594
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,030
perception measures can be problematic

595
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:08,850
as predictors of behavior under normal

596
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:11,270
conditions but when a security incident

597
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:13,290
is salient in people's minds

598
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:15,810
self-reported risk perceptions are much

599
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:17,760
more likely to be accurate that's not

600
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:19,950
because the perceptions changed but

601
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,770
because the behavior associated with the

602
00:25:19,950 --> 00:25:24,990
perceptions did when the incident was

603
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:26,760
salient the participants behavior was

604
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:29,370
aligned with their self-reported risk

605
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:31,290
perceptions before the incident was

606
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:36,000
salient the behavior did not match the

607
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:37,710
perceptions how long this effect lasts

608
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,210
was not measured and that's really

609
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:41,640
that's really interesting to me

610
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:43,470
perhaps psychological priming could be

611
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,780
used to change people's behavior and an

612
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:48,000
information security context this is

613
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:50,250
probably behind the commonly used method

614
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,230
of using fear appeals to attempt

615
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:54,180
behavior change when information

616
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:56,730
security professionals are communicating

617
00:25:54,180 --> 00:26:01,260
risk particularly to non information

618
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:03,720
security professionals fear appeals are

619
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:06,270
persuasive messages that use fear to try

620
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,860
to change behavior fear appeals can be

621
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:10,560
counterproductive if they're not used

622
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:13,020
carefully simply increasing fear in

623
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,790
one's audience without also providing

624
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:17,460
clear and actionable solutions can

625
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:20,280
backfire and result in a sense of

626
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:22,110
helplessness and apathy information

627
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:23,490
avoidance that is not listening to the

628
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:24,629
message because it makes the listener

629
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,820
feel bad

630
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:29,660
and a lack of trust in the messenger if

631
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:31,740
the threat fails to materialize now as

632
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:33,480
information security professionals we

633
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:38,520
really don't want to any of those things

634
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:40,320
to occur a more reliable way to change

635
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,889
behavior when using threats is to

636
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:46,350
carefully consider coping mechanisms

637
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:48,860
response efficacy which is will this

638
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:51,780
action work to address the threat and

639
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:55,530
self-efficacy that is can I make this

640
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:57,270
action work are really important to

641
00:26:55,530 --> 00:27:00,210
maximize chances of success when

642
00:26:57,270 --> 00:27:02,670
communicating threats we should be using

643
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:05,850
fear appeal sparingly and think about

644
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:07,590
the balance between fear and hope take

645
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:11,070
into account social norms and

646
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:12,780
organizational culture have clear simple

647
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:14,970
and step-by-step messages that seem

648
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:17,790
achievable to the recipient of the

649
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:19,650
message make it easy for people to do

650
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:23,490
the right thing by having InfoSec as

651
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:26,400
part of the process and be consistent in

652
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:28,430
messaging and behavior particularly by

653
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:31,110
people in positions of authority or

654
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:34,020
influence people have a very strong

655
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:35,820
sense of fairness and when they observe

656
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:38,310
the difference between espoused behavior

657
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:40,500
and enacted behavior particularly in

658
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:41,970
leaders that can really affect them and

659
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:49,620
a really affect an organizational

660
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:51,060
culture okay have a games time all right

661
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,260
well we've nearly run out of time so I

662
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:55,700
suppose I should talk about for crass

663
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:59,010
donation now so what is procrastination

664
00:27:55,700 --> 00:28:01,320
one definition is the voluntary delay of

665
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:03,270
an intended action despite knowing that

666
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,399
one will probably be worse off for the

667
00:28:03,270 --> 00:28:07,020
delay this is not the same thing as

668
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,850
delaying a task as a result of

669
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:12,750
prioritization that's completely

670
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:14,100
reasonable procrastination is a complex

671
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:16,890
thing and it's different for different

672
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:18,419
people than at different times but it

673
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:20,930
can be summed up by this elegant

674
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,930
flowchart

675
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:27,800
there's been a lot of research done in

676
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:30,560
recent years on procrastination a quote

677
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,659
from dr. fuchsias series people engage

678
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:35,060
in this irrational cycle of chronic

679
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:38,060
procrastination because of an inability

680
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:42,250
to manage negative moods around a task

681
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:44,450
and then a quote from dr. Tim Pike L

682
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:48,670
procrastination is an emotion regulation

683
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:54,160
problem not the time management problem

684
00:28:48,670 --> 00:28:59,300
the Krassin ation is a what what is this

685
00:28:54,160 --> 00:29:04,250
it's a vicious cycle very good I was so

686
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:05,960
happy when I found this image it's a

687
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,850
coping strategy for the negative and

688
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:10,310
challenging emotions associated with the

689
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:13,340
task at hand such as boredom anxiety

690
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:16,580
insecurity frustration resentment and

691
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:18,800
self-doubt it's easier in the short term

692
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:21,710
to avoid these emotions and let one's

693
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,330
future self deal with the task once the

694
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:25,580
decision to procrastinate is made

695
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:27,409
there's a momentary feeling of relief a

696
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:30,830
little reward for that procrastinating

697
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:32,180
behavior afterwards more negative

698
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:34,760
feelings occur and these are called

699
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:37,190
procrastinate recognitions because

700
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:39,800
rationally we know that procrastinating

701
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:42,050
is not a good long-term strategy both

702
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,820
the short-lived reward and the negative

703
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:46,310
feelings about the behavior and the

704
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:50,720
procrastination and the tasks contribute

705
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:52,250
to this vicious cycle so some strategies

706
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:56,090
that may help break the procrastination

707
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:58,640
cycle to give yourself as part of self

708
00:29:56,090 --> 00:30:01,090
compassion self compassion can increase

709
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:04,370
motivation feelings of self-worth

710
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:09,050
optimism curiosity and personal

711
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:11,090
initiative try using a focused form of

712
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:12,740
appreciative inquiry think about how

713
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:15,290
you've handled a similar task in the

714
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:19,370
past and identify the positive aspects

715
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:22,370
of the activity and the outcomes when

716
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:24,860
procrastination arises be curious about

717
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:27,709
it and examine how you are feeling and

718
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:29,240
what you're thinking about this may

719
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:32,830
reveal a cause behind the progress

720
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,830
ination for this particular task

721
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:38,370
and then consider the next action think

722
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,300
if I were to do this now what would be

723
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:41,489
the next step

724
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:44,250
this can help generate action without

725
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:46,410
motivation being present don't wait to

726
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:48,480
be in the mood to do that next step just

727
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:53,610
do it the action can actually lead to

728
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:55,740
motivation so action triggers can be

729
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:57,870
used to break procrastination by making

730
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:00,050
that next action happen or more

731
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:02,969
generally just to instill good habits

732
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:06,060
the general idea is to make a specific

733
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:07,880
mental plan to take the next action to

734
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:10,409
achieve something it's a way of

735
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,940
pre-loading a decision in a way that

736
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:14,750
avoids the problems with effective

737
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:16,920
forecasting and competing distractions

738
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:19,470
say for example you know you need to

739
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:21,240
exercise more but when you wake up in

740
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:23,190
the morning and you know you should be

741
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:25,440
doing that exercise or at least starting

742
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:27,330
it you just don't feel like it you say

743
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:29,220
to yourself well I feel like good more

744
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:31,919
tomorrow it's just that today I don't

745
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:36,390
really feel like it tomorrow no problem

746
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:38,400
I'll be full of energy ready to roll

747
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:41,760
this might work you really may feel more

748
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:43,350
like it tomorrow but more commonly we

749
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,670
don't really have a good feel for how

750
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:46,800
we're going to feel tomorrow and that's

751
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:48,510
the affective forecasting flaw we think

752
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:52,200
tomorrow will be great but in actual

753
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:54,240
fact it's often the same as today so to

754
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,520
help yourself avoid this situation you

755
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,500
can create an action trigger before you

756
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,850
go to bed lay out the clothes that

757
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,440
you're going to wear for your exercise

758
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:04,290
and lay out issues so everything's ready

759
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:07,470
to roll then your action trigger could

760
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:09,360
be when I get up tomorrow I'll put on

761
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:11,250
these clothes first and then I'll do

762
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,300
some exercise so that's pre loading the

763
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:14,160
decision you've already made the

764
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,480
decision when you get up in the morning

765
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,940
you're going to put those clothes on

766
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:22,890
that's your next step a relatively small

767
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:23,970
and easy step to achieve many psychology

768
00:32:22,890 --> 00:32:26,850
studies have found links between

769
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:29,700
gratitude and well-being including

770
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:32,189
increased motivation sleep connectedness

771
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:34,770
with others job satisfaction and

772
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:37,440
economic patience which is the ability

773
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:39,420
to forego short-term satisfaction for

774
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,630
long term economic benefits basically

775
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:44,310
saving money gratitude has also been

776
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:47,110
found to reduce anxiety and depression

777
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:48,220
in some people Google Images has

778
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:51,070
taught me that a common way to express

779
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:56,200
gratitude is to stand outside with your

780
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:57,760
arms outstretched like so instead of

781
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,950
trying to convince you of the benefits

782
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:02,290
of gratitude instead I will provide you

783
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:04,660
with some suggestions for how you may be

784
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:06,909
able to increase gratitude in your

785
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:08,410
professional and personal life and ask

786
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:10,840
that you give at least one of them a try

787
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:14,559
for 4 weeks and see how it makes you

788
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:17,199
feel the general strategy is to approach

789
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:19,600
situations looking for opportunities to

790
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:23,830
identify and appreciate other people's

791
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,270
efforts support and kindness after a

792
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:27,939
while it becomes second nature and

793
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:31,840
doesn't feel forced or contrived some

794
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:34,299
tips say thank you in a specific and

795
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:37,389
truthful way it sounds simple and it is

796
00:33:34,299 --> 00:33:38,950
it can be verbal via email sending a

797
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:41,380
card whatever works for you

798
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:45,669
set yourself a goal of doing it once a

799
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:48,190
day count your blessings two or three

800
00:33:45,669 --> 00:33:49,960
times a week and write them down focus

801
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:52,390
on little things not necessarily big

802
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:54,130
things this may take the form of a

803
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:57,210
gratitude journal but it doesn't have to

804
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:59,290
just do what works for you

805
00:33:57,210 --> 00:34:01,630
or you can use gratitude meditation

806
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:03,639
which simply means reflecting on the

807
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:05,890
people and the things you feel grateful

808
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,210
for there are lots of podcasts and free

809
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:09,399
resources on the Internet

810
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:11,109
personally I like guided meditation

811
00:34:09,399 --> 00:34:16,929
because I find it much easier to focus

812
00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:20,259
on but look everybody's different ok fun

813
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:22,450
fact this text here it comes from an

814
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:25,060
auto-generated paper that some academics

815
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:27,219
created to check if a rubbish conference

816
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:29,440
renowned for its aggressive marketing

817
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:31,480
and low standards would accept a paper

818
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,300
without actually reading it so they

819
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:35,740
wrote a script to basically trawl

820
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:39,520
through a whole bunch of other academic

821
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:41,589
papers and pull out phrases that seem to

822
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:43,960
make sense if you just look at it from

823
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:45,700
afar but when you read it it doesn't

824
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:48,149
actually make any sense whatsoever and

825
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:52,359
the conference did accept the paper

826
00:34:48,149 --> 00:34:54,638
later on this became a big story and a

827
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:56,049
number of mainstream media organizations

828
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,180
picked it up and the conference

829
00:34:56,050 --> 00:35:00,340
organizers said look and this was just

830
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,940
an aberration we were really really

831
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:02,950
really

832
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:04,680
and we didn't have time to read

833
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:06,848
everybody's papers and we didn't want to

834
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:08,770
disadvantage some people that submitted

835
00:35:06,849 --> 00:35:12,609
a paper just because we hadn't read it

836
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:14,640
so we accepted everybody's papers sounds

837
00:35:12,609 --> 00:35:16,930
nice but not true

838
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,598
all right thanks very much for your

839
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:22,299
attention this slides got some suggested

840
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:25,569
resources obviously I'm a big podcast

841
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:29,740
fan I think we've probably got time for

842
00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:31,000
a few questions well the first thing I

843
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:33,578
wanted to ask was just remind me what

844
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,450
was the name of that model you were

845
00:35:33,579 --> 00:35:37,720
talking about early on in your

846
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:39,790
presentation the some sort of effect the

847
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,379
endowment effect and devil effect there

848
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:43,750
was a really good example of the

849
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:47,020
endowment effect I believe in the

850
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:49,210
presentation of the 2018-19 also some

851
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:52,839
security survey results where my comb

852
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:53,920
noted that also had seen a decrease in

853
00:35:52,839 --> 00:35:57,339
the number of ransomware attacks

854
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:58,990
reported by their members most likely in

855
00:35:57,339 --> 00:36:02,710
my opinion because of the increased

856
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:03,819
media coverage and the community memory

857
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,630
of that having happened in the last

858
00:36:03,819 --> 00:36:07,060
year's would that be the right

859
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:08,829
interpretation of this that's probably

860
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:10,540
more the availability heuristic the fact

861
00:36:08,829 --> 00:36:13,660
that it was front of mine for people and

862
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:15,940
I knew one of the two yeah that it was

863
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:18,430
salient so therefore it was much more

864
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:19,780
likely to be perceived as a relevant

865
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:22,029
threat what they didn't what they didn't

866
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:24,460
actually cover was whether that was a

867
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:28,420
change in threat behavior because I have

868
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:30,250
heard in other areas ransomware attacks

869
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,540
appear to be more targeted now rather

870
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:33,369
than broad so that could have also

871
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:35,109
explained that same stat correct but it

872
00:36:33,369 --> 00:36:37,359
was interesting to try and see that

873
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:46,150
correlation between mmm effect and

874
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:48,040
change potentially hi I'm just wondering

875
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:50,890
do you there's a thing called the

876
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,089
Gretchen Rubin tendencies quiz that I

877
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:54,009
did a little while ago and I thought it

878
00:36:52,089 --> 00:36:55,990
was really valuable do you sort of write

879
00:36:54,010 --> 00:36:59,530
that or have any thoughts on that I

880
00:36:55,990 --> 00:37:02,439
haven't actually done that quiz I do

881
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:04,089
like Gretchen Rubens podcast which is

882
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:06,339
called happier and she's written a bunch

883
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:09,310
of books too I think you're a big fan

884
00:37:06,339 --> 00:37:12,630
are you Gary yeah so I haven't actually

885
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,630
done the quiz how did you find it

886
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:21,790
and that I if somebody gives me a task I

887
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,790
don't do it myself I don't want to do it

888
00:37:22,359 --> 00:37:26,930
so actually getting stuff done can be a

889
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:28,220
challenge at times but it's more about

890
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:30,799
realizing how yeah that's actually the

891
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:32,660
way I act I can have a strategy to get

892
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,190
around that if I need to yeah so I think

893
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:36,290
with with the rebel thing you need to

894
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:37,970
reframe tasks in such a way that you're

895
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:39,680
not doing what someone's asked you to do

896
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:41,029
because they asked you to do it but

897
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,230
because you actually want to achieve it

898
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:43,760
yourself for some other reason is that

899
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:45,170
right yeah yeah that's right yeah it's

900
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,550
more like hypothetically this is the

901
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:48,710
person I want to be there for I should

902
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:50,119
take steps not I should really do the

903
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:52,190
dishes yeah yes

904
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:54,380
so that's a bit like that taking the

905
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:56,270
next action in terms of those tips about

906
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:58,130
procrastination you try and fool

907
00:37:56,270 --> 00:38:00,710
yourself into thinking look I'm not

908
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:02,960
going to do this but if I were to do it

909
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:05,230
this is what I'd do and then that can

910
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,250
help lead you on to the next step I

911
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:08,990
believe what do you ever speak is um

912
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:10,609
earlier today had something almost lines

913
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:12,049
that the only reason people ever do

914
00:38:10,609 --> 00:38:13,549
anything even in the workplace is

915
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:14,660
because they actually eventually agree

916
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:16,190
with and then go on and do with it

917
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,299
not necessarily because they're told to

918
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:20,359
do it even though that might have been

919
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:23,089
the original instigation could well be

920
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:26,210
I mean look we're deeply deeply

921
00:38:23,089 --> 00:38:30,710
complicated beasts so how can we use

922
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:32,300
this to get over the fact that our users

923
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:38,450
all have awareness and knowledge but

924
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:40,550
aren't applying it well I think I well

925
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:42,169
I'd look I don't know your particular

926
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:43,760
situation but I would challenge the

927
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:49,220
assumption that people all all have

928
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:50,990
awareness I think and even if even if we

929
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:52,848
have some superficial statistics like

930
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:54,979
98% of the organization has done a

931
00:38:52,849 --> 00:38:57,290
mandatory online training course it

932
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:58,760
doesn't necessarily mean that 98% of the

933
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:03,250
organization have received the message

934
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:05,690
in a way that's meaningful to them so my

935
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:08,300
feeling is that if we're going to try

936
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:11,030
and measure anything like awareness and

937
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:12,470
culture we need to be considering all

938
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:14,900
the different factors at play

939
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:16,790
so not just asking people what do you

940
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,650
think about information security because

941
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:21,890
as we saw self-reported measures can be

942
00:39:18,650 --> 00:39:25,280
very tricky to for them to be accurate

943
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:26,390
for a variety of reasons but there we

944
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:28,850
should be also thinking of

945
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:30,440
people's attitudes and their behavior

946
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:33,410
and then how can we measure that in an

947
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:35,630
effective way look at the complicated

948
00:39:33,410 --> 00:39:37,670
thing but it looked my takeaway I guess

949
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:39,920
is to try and get to encourage people to

950
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,670
think about this is a complicated

951
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:43,400
situation

952
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:45,710
so more awareness doesn't lead to better

953
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:48,130
behavior necessarily but a lot of people

954
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:50,720
have that view at least if they're asked

955
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:53,180
superficially what do we need to do well

956
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:55,370
more awareness but more awareness

957
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:57,319
doesn't always result in better behavior

958
00:39:55,370 --> 00:40:08,120
does anyone see a question I was at a

959
00:39:57,320 --> 00:40:10,400
bit of a cop-out well that's a very good

960
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:12,560
leading question so yes what I should

961
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:15,580
have said in addition to what I did say

962
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:17,840
was understanding people's emotional

963
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:21,710
motivations is a really important factor

964
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:24,590
as well and switch by Dan and chip Heath

965
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:26,900
mentioned over here the book second line

966
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:29,930
has some really important really

967
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:32,030
interesting methodologies in trying to

968
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:34,819
engage not just the rational parts of

969
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:35,900
people's minds but the emotional aspects

970
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:38,030
of what we're trying to get them to

971
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:39,290
achieve so I strongly recommend reading

972
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:41,780
that book there you go that's my hands

973
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:43,340
I've read that book and I believe

974
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,810
somebody else commented during the

975
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:46,100
conference that the best managers are

976
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,690
the ones that actually take the effort

977
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,790
to understand each of their staff

978
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:51,740
members and their upline management and

979
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:54,110
actually work towards their personal

980
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:56,359
needs and desires and goals to motivate

981
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:57,500
them and anyway we're all out of time

982
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,320
could everyone please thank Mark for

983
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,480
such an informative and educational

984
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:04,219
report

985
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:04,219
