1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:05,460
so next up we have Martin van horebeek

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:07,798
his although he's come over or come over

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,080
from all the way from San France San

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,320
Francisco talking it's very good for me

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,599
today and his and his presentations got

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,460
global Commons or connected States the

7
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,570
contest for the soul of the Internet I'm

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:21,390
actually really looking forward to this

9
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,789
presentation so mom's gonna tell you a

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:27,480
bit about himself so a subject matter

11
00:00:23,789 --> 00:00:30,660
I'm sure he's very very aware of so

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,620
let's give a round of applause money

13
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:35,850
[Applause]

14
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,709
thank you very much for the intro and

15
00:00:35,850 --> 00:00:40,410
great seeing everyone thank you for

16
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,790
coming out so my name is Martin Van Horn

17
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:43,949
Blake and I'm a board member with the

18
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,899
forum of incident response and security

19
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,629
teams which is an association of

20
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,910
incident response teams outside of that

21
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:53,789
I also thank you very much outside of

22
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,559
that I also work as a lead expert for an

23
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,270
initiative called the best practices

24
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,739
forum on cybersecurity which I'll tell

25
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,629
you a little bit more about later and

26
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:02,640
I'm also the chief security officer for

27
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:06,810
a software company based out of San

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,799
Francisco called Zendesk now one thing I

29
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,200
wanted to give you as a bit of a

30
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,360
starting point is the context behind why

31
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,909
I'm actually interested in this specific

32
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,439
problem and how it actually also affects

33
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,420
you and I want to give you a little bit

34
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,399
of an intro into what's happening in

35
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,439
this space and something that for me

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,509
matters very very deeply is that we

37
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,240
recognize that as incident responders

38
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:29,100
and as members of security teams we

39
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,500
actually all need to work together there

40
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,539
is no way we can win by ourselves a

41
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,400
little bit of you if I go back to the

42
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,070
keynote from this morning from eco hippo

43
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:39,570
Ninh if you look at that Castille and

44
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:41,100
the walls that were building around it

45
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,470
if we're all building our own walls

46
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,210
we're going to lose however if we work

47
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,340
together and we understand from each

48
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,199
other what the challenges are and we can

49
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,149
work across those walls and actually

50
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,070
benefit from each other's experience

51
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:55,290
we're going to be a lot more effective

52
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,479
and that's really what first as an

53
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:59,490
organization is all about we have

54
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,229
members in eighty four different

55
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:04,380
countries actually I need to update the

56
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:06,509
slide is it's 92 today which are all

57
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,269
incident responders just like yourselves

58
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,310
people's dealing with and responding to

59
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:13,680
cyber security incidents

60
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:16,950
as an organization we have one big

61
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,680
vision for us as a community and that is

62
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:22,109
that we are the organization that helps

63
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,090
incident responders be more effective

64
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:26,760
and we want to do that in four different

65
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,709
ways first is by creating this community

66
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,840
where you can actually connect and

67
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:33,239
coordinate in a global way with other

68
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,160
incident responders we want to make sure

69
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,209
that we all speak the same language and

70
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,340
that doesn't mean that we all speak

71
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:39,930
English even though I really do like the

72
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,450
Aussie English accent so that would be

73
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:44,160
what I would be rooting for but we want

74
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:46,530
to make sure that everyone understands

75
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,780
the terminology that we use and the

76
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:51,120
problems that we work on we also want to

77
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:54,450
make sure that automation is easy and

78
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,400
that automation exists so working on

79
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,079
making technologies like the sword

80
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,720
technology that the previous stock here

81
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:03,900
was about more widely available is

82
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,359
really important for us and finally we

83
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,280
started recognizing a few years ago that

84
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:10,050
there were a lot of policymakers that

85
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,780
got really interested in cybersecurity

86
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,790
and in incident response but they didn't

87
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:17,040
always understand exactly what it was

88
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:19,078
that incident responders did so we

89
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,090
actually wanted to work on figuring out

90
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:22,799
how do we get them in the loop and how

91
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:24,810
do we make sure that they understand

92
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,150
what we do so they could actually help

93
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:29,040
us instead of sometimes maybe perhaps

94
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,660
making life a little bit more difficult

95
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,179
and we do that in a couple of different

96
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,400
ways this is a photo of my colleague

97
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,769
Audley Wahid who is actually also here

98
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:40,799
at the conference when he met with the

99
00:03:37,769 --> 00:03:42,570
new newly built Incident Response Team

100
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,760
of the country of Bhutan in the

101
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:46,620
Himalayas so we do a lot of

102
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,048
capacity-building we meet with a lot of

103
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,670
new certs we create standards and

104
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:52,410
technologies that they can pick up and

105
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,358
then also you can pick up for your

106
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:56,040
incident response teams and almost

107
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:58,739
everything we do in that manner is

108
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:01,828
released as Creative Commons so you can

109
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:04,859
actually use it this is another example

110
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:06,600
this was a debate in 2012 at a

111
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:09,030
conference culty Internet Governance

112
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,410
forum organised by the UN when I was

113
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,910
discussion about whether or not

114
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:15,660
countries should be working together

115
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:18,680
only law of the Seas a very big idea at

116
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:21,298
the time that would cover cyberspace and

117
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:23,460
we provided some technical input from

118
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:24,690
the Incident Response perspective and

119
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:26,520
shared with them the different things

120
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:28,830
that would work and wouldn't work if

121
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,080
countries would move into that direction

122
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,000
and then finally we do a lot of training

123
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,219
in education we have open source

124
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,710
training for incident responders which

125
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,160
we teach in various places this was a

126
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:42,750
training that we did in Cote d'Ivoire

127
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,490
but it's actually also available for

128
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:48,300
free from our website so you can

129
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:50,250
actually go download it there now the

130
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,550
talk today that I want to give you is

131
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:56,729
all about whether or not we should be

132
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:59,039
pursuing a global Commons or an internet

133
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:00,330
of connected States and I want to be

134
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:02,400
really clear about it because it is

135
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,710
actually a choice that we have in a

136
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,888
sense that we can look at the Internet

137
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:09,840
as oceans as forests as things that are

138
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:11,580
communal between people between

139
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,280
countries and that we all have to work

140
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:16,050
on together and partner on managing it

141
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,388
or we can decide that we're all

142
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:20,280
countries in it for ourselves and the

143
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:22,620
only ways we really interoperate is by

144
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:26,068
trading by signing treaties by agreeing

145
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:28,199
and in reality we will always figure out

146
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:30,840
some place in the middle rather than

147
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,820
leaving completely in one direction but

148
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,619
I think today we're very much in a place

149
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:36,690
where some of the things that are

150
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,699
happening are not really very conducive

151
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,259
to getting us to a place where we

152
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,330
actually manage the internet as a

153
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:44,280
resource that is shared between all of

154
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,139
us and I'm going to use three quick

155
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:48,239
examples to actually walk you through

156
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:51,810
that and in order to do that I'm going

157
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:55,590
to make a blitz trip from Iran to

158
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:57,330
Amsterdam to the Ukraine and we'll get

159
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:59,909
started with an event that happened in

160
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:02,698
July 2010 and which I think changed a

161
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:04,740
lot of how people perceive what the

162
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:07,289
internet is and what impact it has on

163
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,849
States as we know them today and that

164
00:06:07,289 --> 00:06:11,310
was of course a piece of malware called

165
00:06:08,849 --> 00:06:12,930
Stuxnet now at the time I was lucky

166
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:15,030
enough to work in the Microsoft Security

167
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:17,159
Response Center in Redmond and so I was

168
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:20,130
very involved in the initial response

169
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:22,169
against Stuxnet when it took place but

170
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:24,360
one of the big takeaways for me was the

171
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:26,370
technical complexity of the issue so

172
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,830
here was an attack that actually

173
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:31,500
exploited for zero-day vulnerabilities

174
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:33,330
in various pieces of software including

175
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:36,479
Windows but also the siemens step7

176
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:37,099
software that actually had a physical

177
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,820
impact

178
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:42,980
the world and bypassed a air-gap network

179
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,659
so it made its way onto a network that

180
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,940
wasn't even connected to the Internet in

181
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:48,680
the first place by exploiting a

182
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,290
vulnerability and how specific file

183
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:53,630
types were being parsed on a USB stick

184
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:56,030
now what was really really interesting

185
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:58,040
for me about Stuxnet was how the

186
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,200
countries that were later on assumed to

187
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,300
have something to do with initiating the

188
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,400
attack were some of the first ones to be

189
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,530
really really concerned about it when

190
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,599
Stuxnet originally hits the

191
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:10,219
organizations that me and many other

192
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,980
security professionals ended up meeting

193
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:14,660
with to give them more data on what was

194
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,430
actually happening and how they could

195
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,290
actually protect against it we're in

196
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,120
many ways the countries that were later

197
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:22,220
perceived as being behind the attack

198
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,110
because they had a lot to lose they had

199
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,150
a lot of infrastructure they had a lot

200
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,800
of power plans that were connected that

201
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,679
could potentially be affected because

202
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:32,360
they use similar centrifuges similar

203
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:35,270
devices as what was actually being

204
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:37,010
targeted by Stuxnet so it was a very

205
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,169
very interesting incident that

206
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:42,289
completely spread beyond the intended

207
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:45,350
scope it was probably a state attacking

208
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:47,210
another state's nuclear program and by

209
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:48,950
simply by virtue of doing that they

210
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:51,049
actually spread across the world and

211
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:53,180
ended up affecting a lot more systems

212
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:55,220
now none of those other systems were

213
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,380
affected in the negative way that the

214
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,180
target plant was but keep in mind that

215
00:07:57,380 --> 00:08:01,640
during the initial response because of

216
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:03,620
the size of Stuxnet nobody really knew

217
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,870
that until quite a bit later so the

218
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:07,670
initial response was very frantic it was

219
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:09,740
trying to figure out what is this

220
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:12,980
malware doing and how do we stop it

221
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:15,080
so this became a very big problem and it

222
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:16,820
actually changed the way that a lot of

223
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,710
countries ended up thinking about

224
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:23,960
malware and what malware could actually

225
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:25,640
do moving forward one year to 2011 there

226
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,580
was a small company in the Netherlands

227
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:30,680
called diginotar and diginotar is a root

228
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:32,929
certificate authority so when you look

229
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,750
at any laptop it has about a hundred and

230
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:38,059
fifty companies that it trusts to a test

231
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:40,690
that for instance a website is actually

232
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:43,218
owned and operated by Google now

233
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:45,320
DigiNotar was a CA that was a bit

234
00:08:43,219 --> 00:08:47,960
particular because it also happened to

235
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,910
be a CA that provided services for the

236
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:51,970
Dutch government so it had the scam

237
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:54,170
so part of it but it also had

238
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:56,390
essentially digital certificates that

239
00:08:54,170 --> 00:08:58,370
were essentially signatures by law and

240
00:08:56,390 --> 00:09:01,040
were being used by the government in

241
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:02,930
many different capacities now in that

242
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,530
month or actually a few months before

243
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:08,000
there was a compromise of the CA and

244
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:10,520
someone broke into their systems and

245
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,130
used their hardware security modules to

246
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:16,130
issue new certificates for sites such as

247
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:18,890
google.com but also for instance for

248
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:21,320
Mossad Lavrov Raphael and mi5 dot-gov

249
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:23,120
the UK now there was no indication that

250
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,850
those certificates were ever used but

251
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,830
the Google one specifically was used to

252
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:30,890
man in the middle about 700,000

253
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:33,350
connections all from Iran made by

254
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:35,120
individuals checking their Gmail so the

255
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:37,550
attempt here seems to have been to

256
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,740
man-in-the-middle email traffic from

257
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:42,380
Iranians when they were trying to

258
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:43,730
connect to get to Google and the attack

259
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,910
actually worked for a couple of weeks

260
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:49,250
until it was discovered by a user in in

261
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,780
Iran that was using Google Chrome and a

262
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:53,090
new feature called certificate pinning

263
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:54,500
actually flagged that it was it was a

264
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:57,710
problematic connection and there was

265
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:00,230
some type of attack taking place again a

266
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:02,360
very very interesting incident because

267
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:04,310
the entire world was really affected by

268
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:06,860
this one compromised in the Netherlands

269
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,810
even though the target of the attack in

270
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,820
this case were people that were based in

271
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:13,099
Iran so again you see this attack

272
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,500
spreading way beyond what the original

273
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:17,660
attack was and in fact this particular

274
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:20,060
incident kick-started a whole set of

275
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:22,339
incidents then in the CA community that

276
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,560
were later on discovered and now we have

277
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,480
better technologies luckily to be able

278
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,920
to spot them but at the time it was a

279
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,170
fairly immature place and it really

280
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,819
pinpointed a weakness that ended up

281
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:35,420
being exploited in a number of different

282
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:36,950
ways and then finally moving forward to

283
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:40,579
something a little bit more recent in

284
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:42,380
June of 2017 several companies

285
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:44,500
international companies that had

286
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:47,660
business operations in Ukraine

287
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:49,880
downloaded a security update for an

288
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,740
application called Medoc or rather an

289
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,230
update for an application called me doc

290
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:56,090
Murdoch was accounting software that a

291
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:58,100
lot of international companies used when

292
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,839
they did business in the Ukraine because

293
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,970
they needed to have the ability to file

294
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,280
taxes in the Ukraine and it happened to

295
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,770
be

296
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,390
the most convenient software for it it

297
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:08,970
just so happened that these update

298
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:12,240
servers were compromised and were

299
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:14,370
actually used to provide a piece of

300
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,440
malware called notepad yeah to the

301
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:18,930
machines at these different companies

302
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,340
that were downloading updates now when

303
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:22,140
they got these updates they were

304
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:24,330
infected with not patio which was

305
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,520
seemingly ransomware and ended up taking

306
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:28,380
a lot of very very large organizations

307
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,470
including for instance the chipping

308
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:33,060
chipping giant mask now this was a

309
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:36,330
particularly interesting incident

310
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:37,979
because a both undermines the update

311
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:40,860
mechanism of a very common application

312
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,390
in the country it was clearly targeted

313
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,180
towards companies doing business in

314
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:48,360
Ukraine but because it also exploited a

315
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:50,520
vulnerability that allowed it to infect

316
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,980
over the network it spread out to other

317
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,449
offices of these companies in different

318
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,150
countries and there's many different

319
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:59,550
assessments of how expensive not petia

320
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:00,930
ended up being but 10 billion is at

321
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:03,569
least one number that was thrown around

322
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:05,579
in a wired article a little bit later so

323
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:07,290
it was a very very expensive attack and

324
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,860
in fact there was a very interesting

325
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:14,400
outcome from this as well quite recently

326
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:16,140
where a cookie manufacturer ended up

327
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,750
filing an insurance claim for the

328
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:21,120
damages that they had for not petia now

329
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,860
the insurance claim that they filed was

330
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,050
under property insurance not cyber

331
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:27,600
insurance so it's a little bit different

332
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:30,180
than a typical cyber insurance claim but

333
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,420
that particular claim was denied because

334
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:35,400
the company was according to the insurer

335
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:38,790
affected by an attack that was actually

336
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:40,130
warlike activity so the systems that we

337
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:42,750
have built to protect our own

338
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:44,970
organizations both in terms of defending

339
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:47,370
against attacks such as installing

340
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:49,470
updates were used against us to

341
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:51,540
compromise our own networks and then our

342
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:53,040
insurance providers are getting to a

343
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:54,510
point where some of them at least are

344
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,030
declining insurance because that's

345
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:58,890
warlike activity happening so you can

346
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:01,680
see that the impact of these incidents

347
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:05,370
is pretty tremendous and has a lot of

348
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,589
impact on us as organizations and really

349
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:11,400
in many ways as Internet users and

350
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:13,230
medicines so when I talked earlier about

351
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,170
the fact that we could be a global

352
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:17,959
Commons or we could be

353
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:19,459
a set of interconnected states there's

354
00:13:17,959 --> 00:13:22,420
actually some really interesting work

355
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:25,579
that was done a few years ago by a

356
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,199
academic at Indiana University and she

357
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:30,679
actually got the Nobel Prize her name is

358
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:33,679
Elinor Ostrom for her work on

359
00:13:30,679 --> 00:13:36,169
identifying how communities can actually

360
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:38,029
govern the Commons and many of those

361
00:13:36,169 --> 00:13:40,639
things include making sure that as a

362
00:13:38,029 --> 00:13:42,889
community when you heard your sheep in a

363
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,049
particular field you could only heard as

364
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:47,629
many sheep as you've actually been able

365
00:13:45,049 --> 00:13:49,309
to care for five years before there's

366
00:13:47,629 --> 00:13:50,839
many different rules and principles that

367
00:13:49,309 --> 00:13:53,540
she identified that are very very

368
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:57,079
helpful but as you can see we are right

369
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,849
now in a dark place where things look a

370
00:13:57,079 --> 00:14:01,579
little bit differently and we don't seem

371
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:02,929
to be thinking about the best interest

372
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:05,868
of the Internet and in fact we're just

373
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:07,850
trying to get short-term benefits and so

374
00:14:05,869 --> 00:14:11,149
a very important question for me and

375
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:13,579
also for first as an organization is how

376
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:15,799
we actually break this negative cycle

377
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:17,959
and how we end up in a community where

378
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:19,699
we all work together on making the

379
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:21,679
internet safer and some of these

380
00:14:19,699 --> 00:14:24,679
behaviors that I just talked about which

381
00:14:21,679 --> 00:14:27,738
all seem to be state initiated or not

382
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:29,540
considered reasonable and some offensive

383
00:14:27,739 --> 00:14:34,009
activity by States we will never be able

384
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:36,079
to exclude but the activity that impacts

385
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:38,509
very large communities that removes

386
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,790
trust from individuals on using the

387
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:42,799
internet and makes our life very very

388
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:45,618
hard to actually operate businesses

389
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:47,529
reliably in the Internet as we do in our

390
00:14:45,619 --> 00:14:50,149
legal systems within our countries is

391
00:14:47,529 --> 00:14:52,399
absolutely unacceptable and there's a

392
00:14:50,149 --> 00:14:54,079
lot of work going on in the community to

393
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,059
get to a better state and I want to use

394
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,488
today to talk to you a little bit about

395
00:14:56,059 --> 00:15:00,319
what is happening in that community but

396
00:14:58,489 --> 00:15:02,239
before we go there I need to cover

397
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:04,399
something that is probably the driver

398
00:15:02,239 --> 00:15:07,549
forward a lot of these issues and that

399
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:09,439
is our national interests now some of

400
00:15:07,549 --> 00:15:12,589
you may recognize this this was a chip

401
00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:13,939
that the US government in 1993 started

402
00:15:12,589 --> 00:15:16,669
promoting it was called the Clipper Chip

403
00:15:13,939 --> 00:15:19,039
the idea behind the Clipper Chip was

404
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:20,359
that it would become possible for

405
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:22,759
everyone to have encrypted

406
00:15:20,359 --> 00:15:24,079
communications over the phone with one

407
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:26,119
little exception that was that the

408
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:27,030
government would be able to listen in on

409
00:15:26,119 --> 00:15:29,100
every phone call

410
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:31,350
and this chip was the guarantee that

411
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,630
that would happen now the chip didn't

412
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:35,460
end up being very popular because I live

413
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:37,410
in the United States I'm actually from

414
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:39,180
Europe but people in the United States

415
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:41,579
don't always trust the government very

416
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,780
much so as a result they didn't

417
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:45,090
necessarily want the government to

418
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:47,790
listen in on all communications but you

419
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:50,370
can see that that same issue actually is

420
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:52,650
just part of a much wider and longer

421
00:15:50,370 --> 00:15:55,680
conversation that started off with

422
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:57,120
export controls until the early 90s much

423
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:59,520
of encryption was actually on the a

424
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,680
munitions list in the United States and

425
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:03,480
was not something you could export then

426
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,819
there was a Clipper Chip there was

427
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:08,190
something called dual EC drbg which was

428
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,570
a pseudo-random number generator that

429
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:11,940
was widely believed to contain a

430
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:14,040
backdoor but that was considered to be a

431
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,900
relative standard and promoted by the US

432
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,240
government and finally today you see a

433
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:21,030
lot of discussion about the FBI and

434
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:22,650
Apple trying to figure out how do how

435
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:25,230
this law enforcement actually get access

436
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:27,329
to data on phones so these are very big

437
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,790
societal problems there are no necessary

438
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:31,200
easy answers for any of these these are

439
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:33,240
trade-offs that we need to weigh as

440
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:35,760
communities but you can see that quite

441
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,920
often the problems run over a very very

442
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:40,470
long period of time and it kind of

443
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:42,719
brings into context how the definition

444
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:44,760
of a state actually is being a little

445
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,370
bit criticized by this concept that we

446
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:49,380
have which is the Internet Mikko this

447
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:51,570
morning made a much better argument than

448
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:53,420
I ever could for why there are no more

449
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:55,530
borders everything right now is

450
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:57,870
transnational when you think about the

451
00:16:55,530 --> 00:17:00,569
internet and how it works we don't

452
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:02,550
really have solid international laws we

453
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,810
have some work that's happening there

454
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:06,119
and I'll talk a little bit more about

455
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:09,149
that later but there is no real common

456
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:10,649
understanding what a cybercrime a really

457
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:12,630
interesting thing for me was when I

458
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:14,610
moved at a certain point in time between

459
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,470
employers and I went from a software

460
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:18,990
company to a company that was more an

461
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:20,940
online services provider and suddenly I

462
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:22,740
was being contacted by very much the

463
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:25,380
same people but about very different

464
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:27,690
issues which they consider to be cyber

465
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:29,520
security issues at the software vendor I

466
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:31,710
ended up working with them on security

467
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,840
vulnerabilities at the online services

468
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:35,340
provider many of the questions I got

469
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,470
were around videos that were being

470
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,899
posted to the service that we actually

471
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:41,370
operated and that they consider to be a

472
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,840
cyber security

473
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:45,870
so there isn't really a lot of agreement

474
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:47,909
there another thing that is critical

475
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:49,500
about a state is that a state has the

476
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:51,360
unique ability to engage with other

477
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,790
states so for instance if I get off a

478
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,979
plane here in Australia and I tell you

479
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:57,780
I'm here to negotiate on behalf of the

480
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:59,669
United States government you'll probably

481
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:01,830
laugh me out the door and legitimately

482
00:17:59,669 --> 00:18:03,990
so because that's not something that

483
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,820
individuals do that is something that

484
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:09,299
elements of the state do that have that

485
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:11,428
role and with the diginotar incident in

486
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:13,350
particular where you saw digital

487
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:15,660
certificates being issued that

488
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:19,709
impersonated parts of the government

489
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:21,360
it's a very interesting echo of how that

490
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:23,640
ability to engage with other states

491
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,790
really depends on how trustworthy your

492
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,770
communications are a political scientist

493
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:32,490
from Germany also had a definition that

494
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:34,860
a state is a country is a territory and

495
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:37,020
a government that has a monopoly on the

496
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:38,070
use of force within that particular

497
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,590
territory

498
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:42,720
Stuxnet actually undermines that in a

499
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:44,970
way because the use of force isn't

500
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:47,309
necessarily violence between people it

501
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:48,809
can also be activities that break things

502
00:18:47,309 --> 00:18:50,940
for instance which was definitely the

503
00:18:48,809 --> 00:18:53,600
case with the attack on the Iranian

504
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:57,299
nuclear installation in Natanz and

505
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,770
finally states are also often identified

506
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:01,530
by the fact that they provides a very

507
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:04,320
critical key services issuing passwords

508
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:06,299
being able to make it possible for

509
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,090
people to receive mail in many countries

510
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:11,160
still is actually a state provided

511
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:13,889
service you can see that a lot of those

512
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:16,230
services are slowly also being served by

513
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:18,540
online services providers so there's a

514
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:20,880
lot of change to how states have

515
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:23,428
actually worked with their citizens just

516
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,049
in the last 25 years and I think that

517
00:19:23,429 --> 00:19:27,540
isn't a bad thing it's also a lot of

518
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:29,940
good thing it's just change and so this

519
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:32,100
is a very difficult time where we're all

520
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:36,630
trying to manage that change and work to

521
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:38,610
it now in 1996 there was a hacker in the

522
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:40,559
United States who goes by the name

523
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:42,629
mentor his real name was Lloyd

524
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,639
Blankenship and he wrote this very

525
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:46,110
interesting piece of text I believe it

526
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:49,290
was shortly after he was actually

527
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:51,689
imprisoned for a crime at the time and

528
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:53,100
he makes this really compelling argument

529
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,000
that the Internet is actually something

530
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,129
different

531
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,890
and all the internets different rules

532
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:02,400
apply now I think today we have a very

533
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:05,640
much more strong view on the fact that

534
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,980
law also applies online and so a lot of

535
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:10,260
this no longer really holds true but I

536
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:13,050
think the principle behind it of we're

537
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:15,090
dealing with a new technology that isn't

538
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:17,010
just changing the way we use technology

539
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:19,679
but it's changing the way we actually

540
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:21,840
live and breathe Society absolutely is

541
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:23,790
true and when you look at how the

542
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,070
internet grows you see that very same

543
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,840
like challenge rising and becoming

544
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:29,159
bigger because if you look at internet

545
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,050
adoption rates first of all

546
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,930
congratulations Australia or actually

547
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:36,090
all the way near the top way beyond even

548
00:20:33,930 --> 00:20:37,950
the United States but if you look at

549
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:41,100
countries like India and China they're

550
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:42,930
just hovering around the 50% mark which

551
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,909
means that many many many more people

552
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:46,950
are going to be coming online in the

553
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:49,170
next few years that are actually online

554
00:20:46,950 --> 00:20:50,730
today and for them the internet means

555
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:52,200
very different things because keep in

556
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:54,570
mind many of them won't have a

557
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,150
background to understand what cyber

558
00:20:54,570 --> 00:20:58,770
crime or cyber security issues are some

559
00:20:57,150 --> 00:21:00,900
of them will be users that use the

560
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:02,639
Internet in a very specific way for

561
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:04,380
instance to get remote medical care and

562
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,430
won't be using a lot of the technologies

563
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:10,800
that we today take for granted now by

564
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:13,530
itself the internet becoming bigger is

565
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:15,030
always a very very good thing but it

566
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:17,850
also does make things a little bit

567
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:20,760
tougher on countries and States if you

568
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:23,969
look at 2016 it was with this tweet that

569
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:27,180
Mozilla announced that they actually saw

570
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:29,910
over 50% of all HTTP requests being

571
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:32,010
HTTPS so that meant governments were

572
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:33,720
silently going dark and when they try to

573
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:35,640
monitor for things they wouldn't they

574
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:38,190
wouldn't be able to monitor them anymore

575
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,690
as a technologist I think this is a good

576
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:42,360
thing but there's clearly a lot of

577
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:44,040
societal issues related to that where we

578
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:47,760
need to have discussions and we need to

579
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:49,980
have debates so as countries have these

580
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,440
rising concerns it's very important for

581
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:54,690
us as people that in many cases operate

582
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:57,360
a network that we realize that countries

583
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:59,760
have different tacks that they take to

584
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,199
look at this problem some countries

585
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,940
especially the ones that have issues

586
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,370
like domestic terrorism or that have

587
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,250
porous borders are always going to look

588
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:09,530
at cyber as a probe

589
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:11,000
from a national security perspective you

590
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:13,220
see the solid in Africa where they're

591
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,650
very concerned about security because

592
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:17,360
they have other security issues and they

593
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:19,760
immediately think of the impacts that

594
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:20,389
the internet is going to have on those

595
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,940
issues

596
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:25,340
there's also countries that choose to

597
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:26,720
prioritize social concerns for instance

598
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,790
you see that a lot with very small

599
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,370
countries where there might be issues

600
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:34,730
with social cohesion or even really the

601
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:36,889
understanding that there is such a thing

602
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:39,230
as a country and a national viewpoint

603
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:41,930
they may actually see the internet as a

604
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:44,540
way of improving social cohesion and

605
00:22:41,930 --> 00:22:47,330
making it easier for them to bring the

606
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:49,040
country together and finally economic

607
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:51,080
improvement is a very big one you see

608
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:52,850
that especially in Asia where countries

609
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,159
are doubling down on the internet as a

610
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:58,010
way to increase commerce increase trade

611
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,930
and drive innovation and leapfrog ahead

612
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:01,580
of other countries so there's many

613
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:03,140
different countries that take completely

614
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:05,540
different perspectives on these issues

615
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:07,610
and the challenge that we're now seeing

616
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:09,230
as Atos countries often don't trust each

617
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:11,149
other because they have different

618
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:15,200
priorities and they come from very

619
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:18,820
different angles I seem to meet a

620
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,820
charter for this level

621
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:32,270
this might be the one let's give this a

622
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,270
try

623
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:44,350
I think that's it great sorry for the

624
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:46,120
technical interruption so these

625
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:47,559
countries often have issues trusting

626
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:49,629
each other and there's a couple of

627
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:51,340
different ways why that is the case the

628
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:53,470
first one I already mentioned legal

629
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:56,559
frameworks another one is that you

630
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:58,540
rarely really know which country did a

631
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,700
particular act or took some particular

632
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:03,690
action the incidents earlier there's a

633
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:05,919
lot of assumptions there's also a lot of

634
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:09,309
attribution but quite often that

635
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:11,020
attribution is actually based on things

636
00:24:09,309 --> 00:24:13,120
that were gathered - signals

637
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:14,860
intelligence or human intelligence and

638
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,049
it's not always based on something that

639
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:19,149
smaller countries would necessarily have

640
00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:21,160
access to and finally there's a real

641
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:23,590
problem with intent for instance if you

642
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:26,320
run a power plant and you find malicious

643
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:28,750
code on your power plant systems that

644
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,939
could be both to spy on how much power

645
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:33,370
is actually being generated for part of

646
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:35,559
the population and to measure economic

647
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:37,449
growth in the long run or it could be an

648
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:39,910
attempt to sabotage your power plant and

649
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:41,980
the reality is with today's malware that

650
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:44,200
quite often allows you to do pretty much

651
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:46,990
either of those it's very very difficult

652
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:50,470
to actually determine intent behind a

653
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:52,600
cyberattack luckily there's been a lot

654
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:55,270
of international cooperation so far and

655
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:57,760
this graph is just a quick view of how

656
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:59,440
political scientists see the global

657
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,929
cyber regime so the different

658
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,030
organizations that all partner together

659
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:06,370
and work together on making the internet

660
00:25:04,030 --> 00:25:08,110
run the me this is always an eye-opener

661
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:10,418
because when I saw this I wasn't really

662
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:11,590
that interested in governance yet and I

663
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:13,600
was really looking at it from an

664
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:17,049
engineering an engineer's perspective

665
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:18,939
and I saw the ITF building standards and

666
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:20,860
I saw companies implementing an

667
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:22,630
operating large parts of that internet

668
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,330
but there's actually a lot of debate and

669
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:27,010
discussion that ends up influencing

670
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:29,918
those decisions even before they are

671
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:32,140
made when I said there's no real global

672
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,270
legal frameworks there actually is at

673
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:36,370
least one that is fairly global and

674
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:38,230
that's the Budapest Convention it was

675
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:40,629
developed by the Council of Europe

676
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:44,020
in the early 2000s it was actually

677
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:45,880
started being drafted in 1997 which is

678
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:47,379
one of its problems so it was developed

679
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,090
before social media

680
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:49,750
it was developed before all of the

681
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,060
online search

682
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:54,250
we use today but perhaps most

683
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:56,320
importantly the Budapest Convention

684
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:58,690
struggles with the fact that it was was

685
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,460
absolutely developed by a number of

686
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:02,950
states in Europe and in the West and

687
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:05,680
today they are trying to get other

688
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:07,930
countries to adopt it and because of

689
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:10,090
that distrust that I mentioned some

690
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:12,400
other parts of the world are going to be

691
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:14,470
more hesitant to adapt adopt a legal

692
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,390
framework that actually comes from a

693
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:17,770
different part of the world and so

694
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:20,530
that's a big challenge that the Budapest

695
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:22,780
Convention has run into which means that

696
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:25,899
today it's only ratified by about 63

697
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:29,129
countries out of about 187 recognized by

698
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:31,660
the UN there's also been voluntary

699
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:33,400
proposals and partnerships such as the

700
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:35,740
Wassenaar arrangement which is actually

701
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:38,260
an export control arrangements for dual

702
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:40,360
use goods and it's actually fairly old

703
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:42,910
but more recently they have started

704
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:44,770
looking at technologies such as

705
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:46,570
intrusion and surveillance technology

706
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:48,940
and see how they can actually regulate

707
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:50,620
and restrict some of doubts this has

708
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,810
been a bit of a challenge because as

709
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:54,729
they made decisions they made decisions

710
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:56,830
that actually made the work of security

711
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:58,750
professionals very difficult so the

712
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:00,790
definition of intrusion software wasn't

713
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:03,130
very clear at a certain point in time it

714
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:05,020
even included a in many ways the

715
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:06,940
burghers that could be used to trace

716
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:09,250
code so luckily there's been a lot of

717
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:10,960
work on it over the last few years with

718
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:13,390
a lot of really solid engineers from the

719
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:17,260
community providing input to the people

720
00:27:13,390 --> 00:27:19,390
designing Wassenaar and updating it one

721
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:22,690
approach that was taken by the UK

722
00:27:19,390 --> 00:27:25,060
government in 2011 was to start up a new

723
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:27,600
process where a single country would

724
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:29,860
host a major conference every two years

725
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:32,949
approximately and in that conference

726
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:35,290
conference settle on a set of principles

727
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:37,690
to govern behavior so it wouldn't make

728
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:39,790
decisions per se but it would be a place

729
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:41,650
for governments to come together talk

730
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:44,350
about some of these challenges and agree

731
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:46,510
on rough outlines work together towards

732
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:49,419
more agreement that could then translate

733
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:51,760
in either treaties or laws or any other

734
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:53,470
types of output now this process has

735
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,570
been going on for a few years and

736
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:57,310
actually had a lot of good effects an

737
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:59,620
organization came out of this called a

738
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:00,370
global forum on cyber expertise which

739
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,879
has been doing a lot of

740
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:04,428
capacity-building and prepare

741
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,650
of documentation that new incident

742
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:08,799
responders and security teams across the

743
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:11,450
world can pick up so it's been helpful

744
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:13,250
right now it's a little bit in a dormant

745
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:14,870
phase because I think we're all waiting

746
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:16,760
to figure out where the next meeting is

747
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:19,459
going to be and what the focus of it

748
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:21,530
will be there's also been a couple of

749
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:23,330
regional approaches within ASEAN

750
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:25,850
specifically the Association of

751
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:28,370
Southeast Asian Nations there's been a

752
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:30,439
lot of work to figure out how they can

753
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:33,530
really best support cybersecurity

754
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,360
capacity-building more recently last

755
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:37,760
year they've started picking up a lot of

756
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,949
more international efforts and promoting

757
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,840
them within ASEAN using what they call

758
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:43,880
the ASEAN way which is really all about

759
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,039
building more predictable relationships

760
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:49,070
rather than having hard commitments and

761
00:28:46,039 --> 00:28:51,350
an agreements within the Shanghai

762
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:53,389
Cooperation Organization there's also

763
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:56,090
been a push but that push has been more

764
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:58,159
to propose a strong international code

765
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:59,959
of conduct under the United Nations that

766
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,360
everyone would agree on and that process

767
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:04,070
has stalled a little bit and converted

768
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:06,500
into some other mechanisms I'll talk

769
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:08,809
about in a second now the interesting

770
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:11,000
thing about regional approaches is that

771
00:29:08,809 --> 00:29:12,590
technology isn't really regional in the

772
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,320
sense that many technologies are built

773
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:18,129
in a country used across the globe and

774
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:21,200
it makes it quite challenging when

775
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:23,390
regions take a very specific tak for

776
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,070
other countries to easily trust and buy

777
00:29:23,390 --> 00:29:26,570
into those approaches a little bit

778
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:29,299
similar to what happened originally with

779
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:30,740
the Budapest convention in the United

780
00:29:29,299 --> 00:29:33,470
Nations there's been a lot of work

781
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:34,730
ongoing since 1998 there's actually been

782
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:37,789
an annual report from the

783
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:40,820
secretary-general of the UN on cyber

784
00:29:37,789 --> 00:29:43,250
security interestingly enough can anyone

785
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:45,830
guess which country has responded to

786
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:50,470
every call since this this process

787
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:50,470
actually started it's a bit unexpected

788
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:55,639
so the country that got started

789
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:58,490
responding and continued to respond

790
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:00,440
every year was actually Cuba and the

791
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:03,919
reason why they responded was because

792
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:06,140
they wanted to flag the concern of radio

793
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:08,809
transmissions from the United States and

794
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:10,159
in propaganda into Cuba now the reason

795
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:12,620
why this is interesting is because it

796
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,060
shows you how different states perceive

797
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:16,399
information security

798
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:18,110
and cybersecurity so something to be

799
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,960
aware of that we're coming from very far

800
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:24,590
and were slowly all moving a little bit

801
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:26,780
closer hopefully um the ITU has done a

802
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:28,100
lot of work on cybersecurity capacity

803
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:30,410
building they have their global cyber

804
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:32,360
security agenda but I specifically want

805
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:34,610
to dive deep for a second into the UN

806
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:36,709
group of governmental experts which is a

807
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:39,709
group that's being convened every couple

808
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:41,390
of years of UN member states where they

809
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:43,100
actually work together and try to come

810
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:45,530
up with a consensus view on cyber

811
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:47,659
security and of one of the groups that

812
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:49,120
actually managed to gain a consensus

813
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:52,640
view of the countries participating

814
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:56,149
which was 16 in total in 2015

815
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,460
the UN GGE published this set of norms

816
00:30:56,150 --> 00:31:00,740
as they call it which were responsible

817
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:02,420
rules of behavior for states on the

818
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:03,800
internet some of these are really

819
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:06,620
interesting for instance one of the

820
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:08,750
statements in here is that a country

821
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:10,639
should never attack the national

822
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:13,070
computer security incident response team

823
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,660
of another country because they really

824
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:17,540
need to be available to deal with

825
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:20,630
security incidents when they happen now

826
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:24,080
this initiative is continuing the last

827
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:26,480
one that was initiated in 2016 I believe

828
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,399
didn't unfortunately get to a consensus

829
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,620
view so they didn't publish any output

830
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,630
but they are starting again this year

831
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:34,699
with two different initiatives actually

832
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:36,770
both endorsed by the UN General Assembly

833
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:38,900
there will be the government group of

834
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:40,700
experts which is 25 selected member

835
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,310
states including Australia

836
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:45,710
congratulations that will be working on

837
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:48,110
identifying more of these types of norms

838
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:49,640
more of these types of behaviors that

839
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:51,679
should be encouraged within the global

840
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,450
community and then there will also be a

841
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:56,090
second group called open and that

842
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:58,400
working group which is going to be

843
00:31:56,090 --> 00:32:00,379
focused on identifying and progressing

844
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,430
the implementation of the work that's

845
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:04,010
already been done

846
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:06,680
by the UN GGE and it's quite interesting

847
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:07,700
because both of them will allow input

848
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:11,870
from a slightly different perspective

849
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:14,240
the gge well this year allow regional

850
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:16,310
bodies such as ASEAN to provide input

851
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,170
and the open-ended working group will

852
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:20,690
actually allow input from nonprofit

853
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:21,770
organizations businesses and so on

854
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:24,500
so there will be a lot more

855
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:26,420
opportunities to participate now within

856
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,600
the UN there's also a bigger initiative

857
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:30,330
called the Internet

858
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,059
form which is now one of the largest UN

859
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:34,610
conferences happens once a year and it's

860
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:37,168
really intended to bring together a

861
00:32:34,610 --> 00:32:38,729
multi-stakeholder community so very much

862
00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:40,410
looking at it from a governance

863
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:43,049
perspective instead of a government

864
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:45,110
perspective it brings together a civil

865
00:32:43,049 --> 00:32:47,340
society it brings together government

866
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:49,168
private sector and international

867
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:51,570
government to debate some of these

868
00:32:49,169 --> 00:32:53,700
challenges in a very very open forum and

869
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:55,530
a few years ago this group determined

870
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:57,480
that they needed to have more tangible

871
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:58,889
outputs so they started working on

872
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:00,720
something called the best practices

873
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:02,400
forum on cybersecurity

874
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,990
and this is a really interesting

875
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,720
initiative because it actually allows

876
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:09,270
all of you as individuals or as your

877
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,710
companies or as your organizations to

878
00:33:09,270 --> 00:33:12,990
provide input on a lot of these

879
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:14,789
challenges this year one of the things

880
00:33:12,990 --> 00:33:17,250
that we're doing with the group is to

881
00:33:14,789 --> 00:33:20,100
review international agreements that

882
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:22,260
have been signed either between or under

883
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:24,809
signed by countries or by different

884
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:26,970
companies and government agencies or

885
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:28,500
multi stakeholder groups and actually

886
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:30,750
looking at some of the commitments that

887
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,940
they make for instance one of them has a

888
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:36,090
commitment around vulnerability equities

889
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:38,700
processes and then identifying what best

890
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:40,379
practices there are that others can pick

891
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,950
up and implement so it can really serve

892
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:46,230
as a catalyst for this type of work and

893
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:48,150
that brings me to where the industry

894
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:51,120
today is really going or the community

895
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:52,740
is going in ox norms me and my partner

896
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,879
drove here from Sydney and one of the

897
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,770
wonderful things I noticed about

898
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:57,659
Australia was that everyone on the

899
00:33:55,770 --> 00:34:00,299
highway actually drives approximately

900
00:33:57,659 --> 00:34:02,039
the same speed which is fantastic that's

901
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:03,450
not a lot at least I don't think it is

902
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:05,760
in a sense that you have a minimum speed

903
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:07,470
and a maximum speed but a norm is that

904
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,300
you drive approximately the same speed

905
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:12,418
and even if you're not speeding if you

906
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:14,010
fly past me very very quickly you're

907
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:16,618
going to make me quite annoyed and I'm

908
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:19,470
going to react to that and in essence

909
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:23,520
you violated the norm now norms come

910
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:25,529
from saw as social science rather and

911
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,509
the idea behind them is that they are

912
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:29,520
collective expectations that we have on

913
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:32,550
a particular actor with a particular

914
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,109
identity norms emerge because people

915
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:35,909
agree that something is a right thing to

916
00:34:34,109 --> 00:34:39,060
do when they start expecting it they

917
00:34:35,909 --> 00:34:41,669
cascade because people start reacting to

918
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:44,040
a violation of a norm such as for in

919
00:34:41,668 --> 00:34:46,290
deploying a malicious software update

920
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,730
and finally their internalized when

921
00:34:46,290 --> 00:34:49,440
people believe it's the right thing to

922
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:51,869
do and they automatically start

923
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,659
implementing the right course of action

924
00:34:51,869 --> 00:34:56,909
and start doing the right things norms

925
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:58,559
can come from any wide set of a

926
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:00,930
community of different organizations

927
00:34:58,559 --> 00:35:02,910
both governments but also private sector

928
00:35:00,930 --> 00:35:04,290
for instance Microsoft published the

929
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:06,629
norm which you see here at the bottom

930
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:09,299
which was a proposal that global ICT

931
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:12,180
companies should always issue patches to

932
00:35:09,299 --> 00:35:13,589
protect users regardless of the attacker

933
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:16,950
and their motives

934
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:18,450
now norms too are not a panacea they're

935
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:20,040
not a solution for everything

936
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:22,500
there's actually three big problems with

937
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:24,540
them there's attribution when you don't

938
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:26,609
know who violated the norm it's very

939
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:28,770
difficult for you to call them out as a

940
00:35:26,609 --> 00:35:30,359
norms violator it's very easy on the

941
00:35:28,770 --> 00:35:31,230
road because you see who it is they have

942
00:35:30,359 --> 00:35:33,359
a license plate

943
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:35,130
cyber is a little bit different there's

944
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,348
a problem with implementation because

945
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:39,119
states may sign up to a norm but if they

946
00:35:37,349 --> 00:35:41,309
don't implement the mechanisms

947
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:42,660
internally to actually live up to it

948
00:35:41,309 --> 00:35:45,140
it's not really working

949
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:48,839
and finally there's no real enforcement

950
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:50,848
so that brings us to the fact that norms

951
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:53,940
really aren't a solution for everything

952
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:56,700
in fact I would say norms loss treaties

953
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:58,589
they're all just tools but what we need

954
00:35:56,700 --> 00:36:00,660
to work on as a community is getting

955
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:02,910
agreement on some of these basic issues

956
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:05,040
and we've been successful at this in

957
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:07,259
many different parts of our communities

958
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,849
and societies we're great at this with

959
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:10,980
search and rescue there's many different

960
00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:13,380
search and rescue agreements across

961
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:16,020
countries that make helping people very

962
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:18,180
very easy in sports were fantastic at

963
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:19,920
this we do global sports events where

964
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,960
even countries that can't participate in

965
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,059
anything else can go and participate in

966
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,160
the Olympics so we're good at this in

967
00:36:24,059 --> 00:36:28,980
some areas but we really still need to

968
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:31,259
grow and so how can you contribute I

969
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:33,420
think the most important takeaway for me

970
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:36,150
having done some of this work now for a

971
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:38,190
little while is that we need to

972
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:40,920
recognize that engineering and policy

973
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:42,900
run at slightly different speeds but the

974
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:45,180
conversations between the two need to

975
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:46,980
happen and need to be in place in order

976
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:48,808
for us to actually get what we want

977
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:52,410
which is a stable and solid internet

978
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:53,849
that we can all rely on right now we're

979
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:55,118
in this really strange place where

980
00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:57,130
everyone is really lucky

981
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,779
at each other and trying to learn what

982
00:36:57,130 --> 00:37:00,640
it is that they're doing that's working

983
00:36:58,779 --> 00:37:03,759
for instance vulnerability equities

984
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,529
processes and the ability to weigh

985
00:37:03,759 --> 00:37:07,450
whether a vulnerability that you found

986
00:37:05,529 --> 00:37:09,519
as a government is something you want to

987
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:11,319
use to attack or to actually defend

988
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:13,988
everyone by reporting it to the vendor

989
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:15,308
is a very very important thing and you

990
00:37:13,989 --> 00:37:17,049
see that now there's two countries that

991
00:37:15,309 --> 00:37:18,910
have implemented them there's many more

992
00:37:17,049 --> 00:37:20,650
that are considering doing it but the

993
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:22,808
conversation still needs to happen

994
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:24,400
there's many different forums where you

995
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:26,410
can participate some of the ones I

996
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,450
mentioned in the UN are very state

997
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:30,729
centric there's several that are more

998
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:32,979
open to private sector as well and civil

999
00:37:30,729 --> 00:37:34,718
society the Paris call for trust and

1000
00:37:32,979 --> 00:37:37,479
security in cyberspace launched by

1001
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:39,039
France is perhaps the best example and

1002
00:37:37,479 --> 00:37:40,749
so I kind of want to leave you with this

1003
00:37:39,039 --> 00:37:43,059
slide which gives you a bit of an

1004
00:37:40,749 --> 00:37:45,249
overview where you as an individual can

1005
00:37:43,059 --> 00:37:46,599
participate and I'll also add that

1006
00:37:45,249 --> 00:37:48,999
within the forum of Incident Response

1007
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:51,009
and security teams we have a working

1008
00:37:48,999 --> 00:37:53,319
group to determine what is important to

1009
00:37:51,009 --> 00:37:55,660
incident responders globally and feed it

1010
00:37:53,319 --> 00:37:57,549
back into many of these mechanisms so

1011
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:59,710
I'd also like to invite you even if

1012

1014
00:38:02,619 --> 00:38:07,719
have ideas thoughts because right now

1015
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:09,940
what is happening is a war on of ideas

1016
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:12,039
and figure out what is it actually that

1017
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:14,829
all of us agree on and building from

1018
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:16,420
there into a better community so it's

1019
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:18,789
really important that everyone gets on

1020
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:20,589
board and and provides their input and

1021

00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:24,369
part of the process and happy to answer
