1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,330
so it's my great pleasure to introduce

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,048
Lachlan Murphy from the Department of

3
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,390
Defense

4
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:08,760
Lachlan holds extensive public sector

5
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,610
experience and is currently a cyber

6
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,740
policy officer within the department he

7
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:15,870
administered the recent diss performs

8
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,390
and continues to promote a security

9
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,100
culture within both industry and the

10
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:27,240
government if you could please welcome

11
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:28,529
Walkman to the stage thank you very much

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,650
that was a pretty good introduction

13
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:33,059
actually now just to gauge the room has

14
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:35,309
anyone sort of worked with defense

15
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:37,169
before yeah that's good

16
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:43,468
is anyone hoping to work with defense in

17
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:45,210
the future no well so I'm the defense

18
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:46,800
industry security program is basically a

19
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,570
membership program for any industry

20
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,129
entity that wants to be working on

21
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,600
classified information or assets with

22
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:53,579
defense whether you want to be working

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,860
on weapons explosive ordnance or provide

24
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:57,270
security services so it has been a

25
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,129
program for quite a while but just

26
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,230
recently come April 9th we have reformed

27
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:03,660
the program with the aim to make it more

28
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,759
accessible for smaller businesses and to

29
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,860
sort of reduce the catch-22 situation

30
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:14,159
where big prime companies were

31
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:15,860
constantly winning contracts so I'll go

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,299
touch a bit on the security environment

33
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,920
so as I'm sure you're all aware the

34
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:21,299
security environment is ever-evolving

35
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,299
and because of this we need to make sure

36
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:25,530
that our arrangements are contemporary

37
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:27,240
so this is definitely evident with a

38
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,490
seemingly increasing number of instances

39
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,039
of espionage and cyber attacks

40
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:34,229
so the Director General of security

41
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,090
Duncan Lewis recently went on record and

42
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:38,460
stated that the threat of foreign

43
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,950
espionage and intelligence is at

44
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:42,689
unprecedented levels this was further

45
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:44,100
backed up by a statement saying that

46
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:46,679
there are more foreign intelligence

47
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:50,729
officers now than there were in the Cold

48
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:53,729
War so in 2016 there was the defence

49
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:56,429
white paper which was 195 billion dollar

50
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:57,929
investment into defense capability so

51
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:01,500
that kind of money obviously doesn't go

52
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:03,899
unnoticed by malicious States or

53
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,119
individuals and as such it makes

54
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,038
industry and attractive target to the

55
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:11,580
threats of both corporate espionage and

56
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,869
foreign espionage and interference so

57
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,950
the foreign ownership control and

58
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,480
influence is in

59
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,579
increasing concern when we partner with

60
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,829
industry and we need to be able to

61
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,660
understand and manage these risks in

62
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,989
accordance with Australia's and defenses

63
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,849
national interests as I mentioned

64
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:28,950
industry is facing greater cyber threats

65
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:31,200
these include hacking as I'm sure you're

66
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,149
all aware recent events in the media are

67
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,040
definitely reflective of this we had the

68
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,480
recent instance of a Western Australian

69
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,209
ship builder have their systems hacked

70
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,840
and we also had the Parliament House

71
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:44,099
hacking as I'm sure you're all aware of

72
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,530
so what's becoming more and more obvious

73
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:48,209
as well is that there is insider threat

74
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,090
within business that is very real and it

75
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:53,190
has to be managed appropriately in

76
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:55,799
addition to all these challenges supply

77
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,569
chains is becoming more complex and to

78
00:02:55,799 --> 00:02:59,849
safeguard these we must encourage a

79
00:02:57,569 --> 00:03:02,250
greater focus on the security culture of

80
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:06,480
Australian industry as we move into the

81
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:08,340
future so as I mentioned this was

82
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,869
historically a program and we've

83
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:11,819
recently reformed it so the old disc

84
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:14,370
didn't really meet the needs of industry

85
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:16,140
or defence so we identified this through

86
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:18,079
a review that involved consultation with

87
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:20,638
both internal and external stakeholders

88
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:23,069
so previously membership was a contract

89
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:24,840
based requiring industry to have a

90
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:27,268
current contract with defense in order

91
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,889
to become a dismember so this was a

92
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:30,959
serious barrier to industry

93
00:03:28,889 --> 00:03:33,690
participation often referred to as the

94
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,430
catch-22 situation for example I can't

95
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,290
get a contract with defense because I

96
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,519
don't have a dis membership and I can't

97
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,010
get a dis membership because I don't

98
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,980
have a contract with defence so that

99
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:46,560
only not prevented that only prevented

100
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:48,149
SMEs from getting into the industry but

101
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,260
was also very inefficient for the larger

102
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:53,160
companies who had to manage multiple

103
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:55,019
memberships and as you can sort of guess

104
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:57,359
it inherently reduced the level of

105
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,650
accountability for these companies you

106
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:00,450
can understand that it also made it very

107
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:01,889
difficult for defense to have

108
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:04,738
appropriate risk oversight of their

109
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:06,900
supply chain it was also difficult to

110
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:08,400
meet the international obligations as we

111
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,870
didn't have a recognised standard of

112
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,040
membership that we could say with

113
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,130
confidence that our industry partners

114
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,630
are currently meeting so identifying

115
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:17,488
these issues revolted in these

116
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,978
significant reforms of the old disc to

117
00:04:17,488 --> 00:04:22,799
the disc that we have today we developed

118
00:04:19,978 --> 00:04:24,840
the new policy through in like extensive

119
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,700
internal and external consultation with

120
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,780
numerous working groups and we also had

121
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,719
a pilot prior to the

122
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:33,210
the pilot process involved both extent

123
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,970
and nudists members including primes and

124
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,349
SMEs to identify any teething issues

125
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:40,020
that are associated with the new

126
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:41,610
policies and procedures and also an

127
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:45,479
evaluation was undertaken throughout

128
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:47,490
this in order to refine it further so

129
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,610
now we talk about the new disp so our

130
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:52,250
new disp directly benefits industry by

131
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,930
reducing barriers for participation

132
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:56,880
making this more accessible for the SMEs

133
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:59,490
and industry without a history with

134
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,790
defense by doing this we increase access

135
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:04,710
to government tendering opportunities we

136
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,420
improve industries access to security

137
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:08,640
services supporting businesses to become

138
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:10,020
what we call defense ready we have a

139
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,550
whole range of tools available online

140
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,590
and we also have a portal that you get

141
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,360
access to once you become a member this

142
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,640
includes things like threat briefs and

143
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,310
physical security information ICT

144
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:21,479
information we also increase the

145
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,280
flexibility around the security

146
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,440
implementation in your organization's

147
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,770
through the introduction of what we call

148
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,510
tiered membership structure you will

149
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:31,950
also be able to have the ability to

150
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:33,630
sponsor your own staff security

151
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:36,180
clearances if you meet the eligibility

152
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,580
requirements so you'll be able to

153
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:42,030
sponsor your staff up to an mv2 granted

154
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:43,620
you can mention certain requirements so

155
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:45,119
different forms will also lead to better

156
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,220
security outcomes by strengthening

157
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,140
planning in contracting and capability

158
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,300
development by embedding specific

159
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,710
security clauses and risk assessment

160
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,410
requirements throughout our smart buyer

161
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:56,609
framework which is our contracting suite

162
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:59,100
we have stronger foreign ownership

163
00:05:56,610 --> 00:06:00,900
control and influence checks and we have

164
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:02,520
more focus on the supply chain by

165
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,820
working with our projects to bring

166
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,870
important elements into the desk so we

167
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,700
recognized that there was a pretty

168
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:11,280
significant gap in the unprotected

169
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:12,659
unclassified space of work so we've

170
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,739
established minimum cybersecurity

171
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:19,140
controls at that unclassified level we

172
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:22,050
also help industry gain a greater focus

173
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:23,880
on insider threat mitigation and develop

174
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:26,970
a strong security culture within your

175
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:29,250
organization we will also have a new

176
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,840
assurance program which is an

177
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:32,160
intelligence led risk based assurance

178
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,810
program that's going to be handled by

179
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,310
our newly developed defense industry

180
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:39,300
security office which I'll touch on a

181
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:40,560
little bit later so this is the tiered

182
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,490
membership structure that I was talking

183
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,500
about this is a very simple

184
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:45,270
five version on our website we've got a

185
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,500
whole bunch of the detailed policies and

186
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,650
plans that we have supporting this

187
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,060
program so as you can see the membership

188
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,679
categories are aligned with security

189
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,330
classifications we've got the entry

190
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,770
level which is the green at unclassified

191
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,039
all the way up to level three which is

192
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:01,049
top secret information so this provides

193
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,849
industry with a greater flexibility when

194
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:04,560
choosing their dismembered ship allowing

195
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:07,080
them to tailor their membership in order

196
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,699
to suit your organizational needs the

197
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,530
implementation of this entry level

198
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:11,819
provides easier access for industry not

199
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:14,190
yet working on classified information

200
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:15,870
and if you do wish to engage in

201
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,000
classified work then we can work with

202
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:19,470
you in order to get you up to scratch to

203
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,870
those higher levels before you enter

204
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:27,810
into that contract so as I mentioned

205
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:30,960
early the dyso has been established to

206
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:32,460
achieve three main outcomes so they're

207
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,049
going to be conducting the security

208
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:36,330
assurance and audit activities across

209
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:38,190
the disk program they're going to be

210
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,900
providing security support and advice to

211
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:41,759
industry by having a Daiso

212
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,370
representative located in every major

213
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,380
city and they will also be working with

214
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:47,639
other departments and agencies in order

215
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:51,960
to coordinate industry security

216
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:53,729
engagement and services so there is a

217
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:56,880
difference framework and it consists of

218
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:58,440
five core elements so it's going to be

219
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,880
an intelligence led assurance program

220
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,110
we're going to be working out what areas

221
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,060
over the highest risk and we're going to

222
00:08:01,110 --> 00:08:05,250
be targeting those areas there's going

223
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,360
to be a five-year forward audit program

224
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:08,190
so we're going to be planning everything

225
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:10,139
in advance we're going to be checking

226
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:12,780
compliance with dis eligibility

227
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:14,430
requirements which will be supported by

228
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,080
organizations submitting an annual

229
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,759
security report which basically is a

230
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,400
report saying that I continue to meet my

231
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,539
obligations under the dis program and

232
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,758
we'll also have a specialized

233
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:25,020
Shipbuilding assurance program as I'm

234
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,190
sure you all know shipbuilding is

235
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:31,349
becoming a very large thing in our

236
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:34,110
organization so what are the costs is

237
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:36,120
always big one so there are no direct

238
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:37,649
costs there are a few indirect costs

239
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,909
associated with dis membership as I

240
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:41,010
mentioned you'll be able to sponsor your

241
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:43,500
own staff security clearances so there

242
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,819
is a bit of a cost to that I believe

243
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,550
last time I checked the baseline

244
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,660
security clearance was around $700 and

245
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:50,180
then when you get up to the top secret

246
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:53,219
clearances they can become a bit more

247
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:55,270
you'll need time to attend and travel

248
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,210
for security officer training

249
00:08:55,270 --> 00:09:00,250
and there may be fees associated with

250
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:01,720
implementing governance personnel

251
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,610
physical and information cybersecurity

252
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,880
arrangements for your organization if

253
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:08,080
need be so as good as it would be to be

254
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,730
able to like give you sort of a rough

255
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,920
idea of how much it will cost it's only

256
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:12,970
a relatively new program so we're still

257
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,219
trying to sort of get a bit of an

258
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,840
indication and as I'm sure you all can

259
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:19,150
understand it does vary a lot depending

260
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:21,280
on the size of your organization what

261
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:27,010
your organization does and how sort of

262
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:28,180
secure your organization or it is so

263
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:29,800
I'll just go into the four categories

264
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:31,780
that you saw in the tiered membership

265
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,060
structure earlier so we've got the

266
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:36,189
governance so the governance will be the

267
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:38,589
sort of main one for most of Industry

268
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:40,690
the main requirements are that you must

269
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:42,580
have a chief security officer and you

270
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:44,380
must have a security officer so the

271
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,570
chief security officer we expect to be

272
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:50,170
able to direct resources to be able to

273
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:51,580
influence policy change so probably the

274
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:53,740
most standard arrangement that we've had

275
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:56,080
is somebody that reports directly to the

276
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:57,730
board of directors but the security

277
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,960
officer will be responsible for more of

278
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,370
the day-to-day management of your

279
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,680
facility and your staff and all that

280
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,760
kind of stuff so for small industry we

281
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,829
can understand that you won't have that

282
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,420
many people who you can have both so one

283
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:09,550
person can play both of those roles if

284
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:11,140
need be obviously for those very large

285
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:13,150
industries you're going to have lots of

286
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:15,130
security officers but we still would

287
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:17,500
probably expect you to have one chief

288
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:19,150
security officer and those chief

289
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,710
security officer and security officer

290
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:23,380
are expected to maintain a baseline

291
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:25,060
clearance for entry level and above they

292
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:28,180
can have higher clearances if they

293
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:29,709
request that so we require you to submit

294
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,989
a foreign ownership control influencer

295
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:33,970
check which basically highlights your

296
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:36,940
main sources of revenue or just lost the

297
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:39,130
back of this and it will also tell us

298
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:40,210
where foreign nationals are located in

299
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,290
your company and all that kind of stuff

300
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,610
it's not something that's going to

301
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,469
prevent you from getting dismembered

302
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:46,480
ship but it's something as defence we

303
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:48,300
need to be aware of before we enter into

304
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,740
contracts and all that kind of stuff

305
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:52,630
so you'll be required to maintain

306
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:53,710
security policies and plans we've got

307
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:55,360
templates for this on our website

308
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:57,640
website has become a bit of a

309
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,660
one-stop-shop for everything so anything

310
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,069
that you need to support your

311
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:03,250
application you'll be able to find on

312
00:11:00,070 --> 00:11:06,520
our website as well and as I mentioned

313
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:08,650
you'll have to be submitting an annual

314
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,460
security report to us every year they'll

315
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:12,100
also be required

316
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,839
to implement annual security awareness

317
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,850
training including insider threat

318
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,740
training we've got a PowerPoint on our

319
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,330
website that sort of highlights how

320
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,800
defense would do that and your security

321
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:23,200
awareness training but we would

322
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,699
encourage everyone to get in there and I

323
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,080
suppose customize it to your

324
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:30,310
organization and then you've as I

325
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,300
mentioned the ongoing reporting

326
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,619
obligations

327
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,270
so that's your annual security report

328
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,459
and then as a clearance holder your

329
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:38,020
required contact contact reporting

330
00:11:36,459 --> 00:11:38,410
incident reporting all that kind of

331
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,060
stuff

332
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:43,750
you can find more information on that on

333
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:45,250
Agatha's website as well so personnel

334
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:47,410
security requirements from entry level

335
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:50,230
and above you're expected to implement

336
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:52,209
their AAS 4811 Australian Employment

337
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:54,670
Standards now this doesn't have to be

338
00:11:52,209 --> 00:11:56,560
retrospective it's only moving forward

339
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:58,360
and it's not a very onerous task it

340
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:00,130
pretty much only involves doing police

341
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:02,020
checks screening the personnel you

342
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:04,120
employee and implementing an appeals

343
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:07,420
process so it's important to implement

344
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,680
these not only for dis membership but in

345
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:10,240
order to have a better understanding of

346
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,370
your workplace so you can implement

347
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,529
security mitigation measures specific to

348
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:16,300
your organization so I believe that

349
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:17,860
there is a review being undertaken as

350
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,060
well which might include a few extra

351
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:23,410
things but I'm not sure when that's

352
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:25,089
going to sort of kick into gear so

353
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,650
physical security is relatively easy at

354
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:28,089
the entry level say if you have

355
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,920
contractors who you contract out to

356
00:12:28,089 --> 00:12:32,320
defense and they're working on defense

357
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,000
sites your organization itself can have

358
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,339
this entry level physical security and

359
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,980
all you really have to do is just tell

360
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:40,420
us where your locations are when you get

361
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,830
into those higher levels and start to

362
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,270
deal with classified information you

363
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:45,339
will have to go through a process where

364
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:47,380
defense comes out to your facility and

365
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:49,209
they'll certify and accredit it to a

366
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:52,140
certain level saying that it's okay for

367
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:55,329
you to store this kind of information

368
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:56,770
now we will actually touch on there has

369
00:12:55,329 --> 00:12:58,870
been a lot of sort of people who go to

370
00:12:56,770 --> 00:13:00,220
external contractors and consultants and

371
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:02,110
stuff in order to get their physical

372
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,360
security up to scratch and then come to

373
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:06,190
defense so part of what we do is we'll

374
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,959
send somebody out to your organization

375
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:10,089
and assess it and we'll give you

376
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:11,529
recommendations on what you should do so

377
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:13,750
if you're thinking of getting into that

378
00:13:11,529 --> 00:13:15,670
work and getting those sort of levels of

379
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:17,560
membership I would advise you to come

380
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,029
contact us first to work out exactly

381
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:22,189
what you need to do to sort of reduce

382
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:26,339
that double handling a bit

383
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:28,760
so the information in cybersecurity we

384
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:30,810
identified that there was five

385
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,970
requirements that would sort of lead to

386
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:34,739
good security outcomes we worked with

387
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:38,100
internal external experts in order to

388
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:39,810
identify all of these so all dismembers

389
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,850
must meet at least one of these five

390
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:43,739
requirements and then when you get into

391
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:45,209
levels one and above then you'll need to

392
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:47,250
have your network certified and

393
00:13:45,209 --> 00:13:48,810
accredited by defense as well and if you

394
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:50,160
get up to level three then it could go

395
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,739
through ASD and all that kind of stuff

396
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,630
so the five that we've identified is the

397
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:56,880
ISO the international standard that was

398
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,800
an obvious one to include in there the

399
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,180
nest the u.s. standard so we recognized

400
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,579
it a lot of the businesses that we work

401
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:05,640
with also work with Department of

402
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:07,410
Defense in the US and the nest is

403
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:10,079
actually a standard that's required

404
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:11,730
under the ITAR requirements as well so

405
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,109
we've got the DEF stand which is the UK

406
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:15,000
requirement and that's the same thing

407
00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:16,740
with the u.s. we recognized a lot of

408
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,990
companies also work for the UK so we

409
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:21,089
want to make it as easy as possible and

410
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:24,600
then we identified the top four of the

411
00:14:21,089 --> 00:14:26,160
asd essential eight we originally went

412
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,810
for the asd essential eight but through

413
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,029
the pilot process we recognized that it

414
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:32,310
was becoming a quite difficult for those

415
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:33,750
smaller industries in order to meet the

416
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:35,670
whole eight so while we do recommend

417
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:37,170
that you do meet the eight the top four

418
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:42,959
are the ones we identified as being

419
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:45,719
mandatory so those of you who were

420
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,640
already dismembers you have 24 months to

421
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,110
apply you'll be able to talk to your

422
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,760
contract managers about all this kind of

423
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:52,050
stuff unless your contract ends sooner

424
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:54,899
than I would advise you to apply as soon

425
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:56,130
as possible it's not an onerous task you

426
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:57,990
pretty much just have to fill out two

427
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,279
application forms which is the foreign

428
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:00,839
ownership control influence check I

429
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,610
mentioned earlier and the normal

430
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:04,560
application form so if you have multiple

431
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:07,529
memberships across your organisation

432
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,449
when we receive your application we will

433
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:13,589
consolidate all those memberships into

434
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:15,029
one company-wide membership how to apply

435
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:16,709
as I mentioned we've got our website

436
00:15:15,029 --> 00:15:18,180
it's got everything you'll need I

437
00:15:16,709 --> 00:15:19,560
encourage you all to go on there and

438
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,420
have a bit of a look about the in-depth

439
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,518
security plans that we have and all that

440
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,990
kind of stuff you just need to submit

441
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,600
your application form and your foreign

442
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:30,720
ownership and control an influencer form

443
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,000
and then we'll do the rest basically if

444
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,319
you have any questions at all contact us

445
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,850
and we'll be able to sort of step you

446
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:38,530
through

447
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:39,760
so I'll just briefly touch on this so

448
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:41,949
while the disp

449
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,900
is a risk mitigation exercise by defense

450
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:46,090
the ultimate risk owners still lies in

451
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:48,100
the contract manager so if you do enter

452
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:50,050
into a contract there may be extra

453
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:51,310
security requirements I can't expect

454
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:54,189
there to be too much unless it is a very

455
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:55,750
classified contract but they may put in

456
00:15:54,190 --> 00:16:00,610
sort of specific requirements to meet

457
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:02,050
the organization needs so that's all

458
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:03,970
I've really got it was a relatively

459
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:06,430
short and sweet but if you have any

460
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:08,050
questions moving forward there's our

461
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:09,370
email address that you can email and

462
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,920
there's the link to our website as well

463
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:21,310
so I'll open it up for a few questions

464
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:22,959
if anyone's going to yes yeah so you

465
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:25,089
will like to so for example if you're

466
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:26,260
applying to be a dismembered that will

467
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:27,880
all be handled through the disc

468
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:31,600
membership so you could consider the

469
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:34,930
disc membership as a sponsor no no no so

470
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:54,480
you can say I want level 2 ICT security

471
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:54,479
and then we'll organise that for you yes

472
00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:09,519
yep so so this is where the tiered

473
00:17:07,628 --> 00:17:12,549
membership structure comes into play so

474
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:14,529
you're able to have as you mentioned say

475
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:16,750
level three in order to sponsor your

476
00:17:14,529 --> 00:17:18,490
staff to mv2 because they're going out

477
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:22,509
to organizations you'll still only need

478
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:25,089
entry level along here no so you can mix

479
00:17:22,509 --> 00:17:26,230
them up yeah yeah yes so you can mix

480
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:28,448
them up and that's why this sort of

481
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:32,620
flexibility comes about yeah makes it a

482
00:17:28,449 --> 00:17:36,879
lot easier yeah yeah 100% any more

483
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:38,110
questions you know well thank you very

484
00:17:36,879 --> 00:17:39,490
much for your time I've got a booth

485
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,870
directly outside we've got a lot of

486
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:42,700
pamphlets and stuff if anyone wants to

487
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:45,129
pick any up or grill me with any

488
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,700
difficult questions on there thank you

489
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:47,800
for your time

490
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:51,559
Cheers Thanks

491
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,559
