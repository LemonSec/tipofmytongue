1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,508
it's with great pleasure I present to

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:08,490
Mickey G and shops presenting on catch

3
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:11,370
me if you can exploring the impact of

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:17,460
ephemeral vulnerabilities they give a

5
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:18,630
big round of applause Gus cool all right

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,699
so we're gonna talk about ephemeral

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,439
vulnerabilities but by way of

8
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,619
introduction so my name is Marco Jenna

9
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,198
raucous I'm the CEO of asset note

10
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:29,609
formerly of spiderwebs I've done a bunch

11
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,640
of presentations you've probably seen

12
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:34,020
some also also in there as well and one

13
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,860
of the organizers of sec talks and

14
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:40,020
Australia's greatest conference Tuscon

15
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:42,629
everyone my name's chubs Hamza I'm the

16
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,820
CTO of acid note I used to be a senior

17
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,430
security analyst at Bishop Fox servicing

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,930
fortune 500 and I'm in the hack of one

19
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,120
top 50 so I do a lot of bug bounty

20
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,680
hunting day-to-day and also the

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,190
co-founder of hackers helping hackers as

22
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,329
well so to define ephemeral

23
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:58,829
vulnerability or meet when we talk about

24
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:00,870
ephemeral abilities what we're really

25
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:02,520
talking about vulnerabilities that are

26
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,009
only existing for a short period of time

27
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,080
that maybe a couple of hours that maybe

28
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:08,670
a couple of days but an ephemeral

29
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:09,929
vulnerability at its core is not

30
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,520
something that you're gonna see in an

31
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,320
environment consistently it's something

32
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,140
that either comes and goes and we try

33
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:18,270
and detect that as best as we can so

34
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:20,939
that sounds pretty straightforward but

35
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:23,158
you know why do they exist why is this a

36
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:24,899
problem and how commonly you know how

37
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,220
come and meet do we find them and what

38
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,200
really is the impact are we just trying

39
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,789
to come up with a word or you know is

40
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,740
there actually a real impact here from

41
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,259
ephemeral vulnerabilities and really

42
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,390
thinking about all these questions doing

43
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,729
bug bounty hunting for almost all of my

44
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,259
security career I've realized that most

45
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:41,159
of the bugs that I find are usually due

46
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,530
to things that are being deployed

47
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,720
constantly and quickly when things come

48
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,250
out things are changing all the time and

49
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,960
that's something that we've learnt a lot

50
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:51,149
at asset node and what we try and bring

51
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,979
back but the ephemeral vulnerabilities

52
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:54,689
are definitely real and today we'll go

53
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,189
through a bunch of examples of where

54
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:57,990
we've actually found ephemeral

55
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:59,729
vulnerabilities in the wild in these

56
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:01,199
examples they're quite critical so we

57
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:02,789
really hope that they'll demonstrate the

58
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,850
impact of what ephemeral vulnerabilities

59
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,530
can lead to cool so what are the key

60
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,419
drivers are the thermal vulnerabilities

61
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,700
so you know as a concept it's not

62
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:14,760
necessarily a super unique or

63
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:17,369
or new idea any bug essentially can be

64
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,019
ephemeral that said if I move on to

65
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,480
Belize at least an hour experience are

66
00:02:19,019 --> 00:02:23,400
becoming a lot more prevalent and while

67
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,879
you can't really pinpoint a single root

68
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,769
cause

69
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:27,120
based on our experience looking for

70
00:02:25,769 --> 00:02:28,890
these bugs across like a number of

71
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,750
bounty programs and organizations that

72
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:33,179
we work with there are some common

73
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,650
elements that are really kind of driving

74
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:36,900
the increased prevalence of these sorts

75
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:38,849
of bugs so at the end of the day you

76
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,170
know vulnerabilities generally speaking

77
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:42,000
are a reflection of the current

78
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,849
development practices and technologies

79
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,680
so recent years have seen some shifts in

80
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:48,480
this regard so you know cloud first

81
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,940
architectures agile development

82
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,459
practices and and things like DevOps and

83
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,310
continuous deployment and these trends

84
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:59,069
have led to three kind of key outcomes

85
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:01,620
one being larger and more fluid attack

86
00:02:59,069 --> 00:03:03,720
surfaces and also like a blurring of the

87
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,860
line between development production we

88
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,970
see a lot of you know assets and

89
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,019
applications being developed kind of

90
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:12,930
live on the Internet

91
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:14,730
and then also as jobs mentioned earlier

92
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,590
like a rapid pace of development and

93
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,388
change and this has led to a bunch of

94
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,069
new challenges in terms of securing

95
00:03:18,389 --> 00:03:22,470
these sort of more modern architectures

96
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:24,660
and traditional approaches have kind of

97
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,609
failed to adapt and this can be

98
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,109
exacerbated in larger organizations as

99
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:30,329
well that have somewhat sort of

100
00:03:28,109 --> 00:03:32,250
complicated structures you know multiple

101
00:03:30,329 --> 00:03:35,100
subsidiaries different teams different

102
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,500
you know capabilities and budget and

103
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,819
this is what's really led at least you

104
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,459
know from from the research we have done

105
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:44,819
into the rise of these ephemeral high

106
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:46,350
impact vulnerabilities so so to move on

107
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:48,869
to some examples like where hackers

108
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:50,100
right so we're always of the pin of the

109
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,780
opinion that the best way to demonstrate

110
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:53,579
something is to show it so that's what

111
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:54,900
we're gonna do and as to know you know

112
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:55,980
we perform continuous security

113
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,930
monitoring for a number of large

114
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,369
companies as well as jobs mentioned

115
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:01,950
earlier the team is very heavily

116
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:03,389
involved in in bug bounties and we we

117
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,730
look at a large number of bug bounty

118
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:08,910
programs so so all of what we're looking

119
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:10,798
at has driven this research and and

120
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:13,019
these outcomes and you know looking at

121
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,060
these companies at scale you know we've

122
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:18,660
seen many examples so we'll go through a

123
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,339
feeling now so the first example I often

124
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,830
like to to say that this example is the

125
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:24,359
afternoon drinks on the Friday where you

126
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,949
know you've got an engineer and you know

127
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,560
everyone likes knocking off on a Friday

128
00:04:25,949 --> 00:04:30,659
it's a principle we often see applied in

129
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,550
most working weeks and at scale what we

130
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:35,219
found is that we actually have an uptick

131
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:36,569
of bugs on the Friday night so we found

132
00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:38,099
much more critical bugs during the

133
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:40,680
weekend and our engines have picked it

134
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:42,599
up much more often because we found that

135
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,099
on Fridays people tend to deploy card

136
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:45,120
and kind of forget about it and come

137
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:47,669
back to it on the Monday

138
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,229
you know it's it's very possible for

139
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:51,049
this to happen and we've seen it in many

140
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:53,758
large organizations

141
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:55,830
so in particular we were notified about

142
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,180
an asset that was responding very

143
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:00,180
differently to how it was the day before

144
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:02,939
we visited this one subdomain which was

145
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,500
like oh gosh admin target comm on a

146
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:07,020
Friday morning and it gave us a one

147
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:09,060
login prompt now one login is a SSO

148
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,620
solution you normally put one login in

149
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:11,789
front of very sensitive applications or

150
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:14,039
any applications that are meant to be

151
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:15,840
internal or only authenticated by only

152
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:17,250
accessible by your employees and it

153
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,659
normally it can be put either at the

154
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,189
application layer or at the reverse

155
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:21,599
proxy layer so it depends where you're

156
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:23,370
putting it but you can apply it in many

157
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:26,310
different places to get that

158
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:28,589
authentication flow in some scenarios

159
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:30,750
are what we found is we worked

160
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:32,279
continuously scanning this and one day I

161
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:34,050
was responding with one login like you

162
00:05:32,279 --> 00:05:35,909
saw in the previous slide the next day

163
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:37,710
it responded with the full-fledged admin

164
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:39,690
panel one login was completely bypassed

165
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:41,400
there was no necessary need to go

166
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:42,509
through one login there's no need to do

167
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,039
that it would just take you straight to

168
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:45,930
the admin panel you're automatically

169
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:48,360
logged in as a super admin and you've

170
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:50,520
got access to every single customer for

171
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,680
this company and this was a huge bug

172
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,210
like this this has a staging instance

173
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,500
which had access to all the production

174
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:57,688
data which is also something we see a

175
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,939
lot as well these days so in this

176
00:05:57,689 --> 00:06:01,560
example on the Friday morning or

177
00:05:59,939 --> 00:06:03,419
afternoon someone had changed the

178
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:05,099
configuration for one login for that

179
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:07,198
host particularly so it didn't require

180
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:08,789
one login anymore and because of that

181
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,620
and we detected that change the day

182
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:17,490
after we were able to access a highly

183
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:19,979
sensitive and critical admin panel we

184
00:06:17,490 --> 00:06:22,050
see a lot of ephemeral bugs in automated

185
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:24,719
process this is a really good example so

186
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:27,529
this is actually a bug in slack so it's

187
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:31,229
exposed git repository which led to

188
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:32,789
leaking of source code and secrets so we

189
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:35,849
set up a sinner to continuously monitor

190
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:36,960
assets owned by slack the platform

191
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:39,960
discovered like a number of

192
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,090
including slack - Rita slack - files in

193
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,340
slack - core and then you know doing the

194
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:47,159
Recon that we do we collected thousands

195
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,948
of subdomain assets for slack and then

196
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:51,840
you know we continuously tested them for

197
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:53,220
vulnerabilities and for a short period

198
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,888
of time I think there's only a matter of

199
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:57,960
act hours right a git repository was

200
00:06:55,889 --> 00:07:00,030
exposed in the web route as you can see

201
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,250
in the screenshot and this actually

202
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:05,460
contained the source code for slacks web

203
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:08,069
application the source code was 1.6 gig

204
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,180
inside in size like we pulled it down we

205
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:14,250
cloned it but the interesting thing

206
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:16,830
about this particular git repo was it

207
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:19,110
had 300 hard-coded credentials for

208
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:21,300
multiple services it was literally the

209
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:24,509
keys to slacks kingdom so we had Dropbox

210
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:27,840
and their salesforce AWS both you know

211
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:29,490
the works you know a pretty serious bug

212
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,820
you know to literally just be out there

213
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:34,680
on the Internet and so it's just like

214
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:37,469
rotated all the credentials and they fix

215
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:40,020
the in the issue and we really don't

216
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:42,419
envy the poor guy who had to rotate 300

217
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:44,340
creds I think it took him a little while

218
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:46,469
but the interesting thing about this

219
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:49,020
issue right so it was ephemeral so it

220
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:51,509
came up under those under those

221
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:54,690
subdomains you know for a short period

222
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:56,009
of time it was picked up again so so

223
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:58,289
initially like you know it was it was

224
00:07:56,009 --> 00:08:00,360
you know they were notified of it they

225
00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:02,340
they fixed it and the sort of initial

226
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,349
view was oh this was just something that

227
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:06,570
a developer has made a mistake right and

228
00:08:04,349 --> 00:08:08,699
expose this when it shouldn't be

229
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,620
but we've sort of monitored continuously

230
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:12,780
and this actually popped up again a week

231
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:15,180
later the exact same assets the exact

232
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,159
same pattern the exact same bug and the

233
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,349
exact same time frame and what this

234
00:08:17,159 --> 00:08:21,960
indicated was that this is not really a

235
00:08:19,349 --> 00:08:24,090
one-off mistake but rather indicative of

236
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,989
a deeper process issue and so we see

237
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:27,169
this a lot with the ephemeral

238
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:30,030
vulnerabilities that they're often

239
00:08:27,169 --> 00:08:32,250
overlooked for various reasons we'll get

240
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:34,289
to some strategies at the end but

241
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:36,570
they're often baked into some automated

242
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:38,069
processes as well where you know people

243
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,510
haven't really sort of floated it

244
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:43,440
through and and how to look at it

245
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:45,329
properly so for the third and last

246
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,670
example I just want to talk about a

247
00:08:45,329 --> 00:08:49,859
scenario where we found keys to the

248
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,819
kingdom one more time for a big bounty

249
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,529
program

250
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,560
and and really it kind of revolves

251
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:57,149
around the fact that today we have very

252
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,770
complex front-end frameworks today we

253
00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:00,570
are developing front-end frame for

254
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:02,339
front-end frameworks like pancakes there

255
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:04,290
are so many different tools required to

256
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:06,390
even get a front-end application up and

257
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,949
running today and as a part of this one

258
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:10,080
of the most popular tools that's used is

259
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:11,640
web pack web pack is used to compress

260
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,160
everything down bundle everything

261
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:15,660
together and then serve it to the user

262
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,520
in the last year we've discovered at

263
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:19,439
least two instances where developers

264
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,600
have accidentally bundled production

265
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,520
secrets in the front-end code and this

266
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,589
happens more often than you think just

267
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,959
because of you know does tiny mistake

268
00:09:25,589 --> 00:09:29,670
you can make to lead to that point and

269
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:31,500
you know production secrets they should

270
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,779
never be in client-side code client-side

271
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,970
code is accessible by usually everyone

272
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:37,860
and anyone can go through it and see if

273
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:39,180
there's any secrets inside so really

274
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:42,270
client-side code should be containing

275
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:44,729
anything like that sort of that sort so

276
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:46,890
in this example we were monitoring a

277
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:48,480
particular JavaScript file over the span

278
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:50,189
of a couple months and we were

279
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,110
monitoring for new API endpoints all the

280
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:54,360
time but one day what we found is that

281
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,770
the the JavaScript file itself at the

282
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,480
very bottom of it if you just scroll

283
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:59,610
down it would reveal all these

284
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,500
production secrets these secrets look

285
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,820
like this when they were beautified so

286
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,610
you can see here it's got you know the

287
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:08,310
AWS access key the secret keys for the

288
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:10,650
private keys of the server and even the

289
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,209
session secret as well this was included

290
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:14,310
in the front-end code for this website

291
00:10:12,209 --> 00:10:16,709
and I don't really think the developer

292
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:19,380
knew about this at all so once I found

293
00:10:16,709 --> 00:10:20,760
these keys naturally I tried to escalate

294
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:23,550
see if I could do anything particularly

295
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,080
but I reported it straight away these

296
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:27,750
keys initially they didn't let me do

297
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:29,790
much they would let me sign a URL on

298
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:31,950
CloudFront and I didn't think that that

299
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:33,540
had that much impact whatsoever and this

300
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:35,160
kind of also goes to show in bug

301
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:37,349
bounties how it's a two-way thing where

302
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:39,150
you know in this scenario I thought that

303
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:40,890
the keys that we had found were very low

304
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:43,110
privilege and didn't have much impact I

305
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:45,720
submitted it anyways expecting a small

306
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:48,029
bounty but it turns out they pay me a

307
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,610
10k bounty for this and I was like okay

308
00:10:48,029 --> 00:10:53,279
wow what why is that what why is this

309
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:54,839
finding so critical and apparently it

310
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,180
turns out those keys would let you

311
00:10:54,839 --> 00:10:58,860
access all the the PII for this company

312
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,500
if you just knew how to do it in that

313
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:03,600
particular way for AWS so in this

314
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,990
scenario that the keys that were only up

315
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,029
for a

316
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:07,500
couple days and it was an accident I

317
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:09,630
ended up talking with this team on hack

318
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,060
1 the the member of the team who

319
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:14,640
published it didn't realize that he was

320
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,050
including the production config JSON

321
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,360
file he was just trying to include all

322
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,890
the J s files and as a part of that got

323
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,050
bundled together published to the

324
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:23,819
internet and we got access to there to

325
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:24,899
everything basically with that that's

326
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,230
that's the third example of the

327
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:30,540
ephemeral vulnerability cool so now

328
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:32,399
you've seen some examples and and house

329
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,939
of ephemeral vulnerabilities can kind of

330
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,080
manifest themselves in an attack surface

331
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,760
we're now gonna go over some like

332
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:41,190
strategies and techniques to mitigate

333
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:44,250
these are ephemeral vulnerabilities so

334
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:46,350
most organizations lack visibility into

335
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:48,720
these issues and including you know

336
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:51,000
large well-funded security organizations

337
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,040
right traditional thinking around you

338
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,770
know identifying vulnerabilities and

339
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,079
remediating them hasn't really adapted

340
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:59,880
to to completely address all these sorts

341
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,250
of issues and there are three key

342
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,170
improvements that we recommend that

343
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,180
organizations can make to to address

344
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:07,560
these issues and to find them so the

345
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:09,599
first one being improving asset

346
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:12,239
awareness second one is shifting to a

347
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,160
continuous assessment / monitoring model

348
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,740
and mindset and then the final one is

349
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,719
focused on impact so when it comes to

350
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:20,399
improving asset awareness we are not the

351
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,470
first to say this and we probably will

352
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,940
not be the last you cannot protect what

353
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:26,220
you don't know is there most

354
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,540
organizations really do struggle with

355
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:29,640
understanding the full scope of their

356
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,649
attack surface and you know the modern

357
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:33,120
development practices and the trends

358
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:35,940
that I mentioned earlier have just

359
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,430
exacerbated this issues those issues

360
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,980
many companies now have very large fluid

361
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:43,920
and rapidly evolving attack surfaces and

362
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:46,140
they really have a little visibility at

363
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:48,000
any given point in time you know to you

364
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,910
know what they're exposing as part of

365
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,680
that attack surface like the question is

366
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:55,260
right the the the golden question is why

367
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,449
can we ask a company like how many AWS

368
00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:00,209
accounts they have the answer is always

369
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:01,709
wrong it's it's never right because you

370
00:13:00,209 --> 00:13:05,189
know you just don't know like people can

371
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:07,439
you know buy AWS on a credit card spin

372
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:09,690
something up you know the reality is

373
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,730
there's there's a lack of visibility so

374
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:13,550
what are some strategies that we

375
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,920
recommend to improve your asset and

376
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:17,000
so the first one is automate depending

377
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,620
on your organization

378
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,630
you know without automation you're not

379
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:23,360
you you're likely going to struggle to

380
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:25,610
keep up with the pace of change a point

381
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,590
in time list of your assets that is out

382
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,840
of date in a week isn't all that useful

383
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:31,190
and that's how quickly these things can

384
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,020
change as we sort of saw in some of

385
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:34,280
these examples they're up and down very

386
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:37,040
quickly

387
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:40,100
don't rely on being told what you have

388
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,510
you know having sort of like a list in a

389
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:43,070
spreadsheet that you've sent around to

390
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:44,660
your organization they say oh yeah these

391
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:47,180
are the ones we've got don't rely on

392
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:49,670
that focus on on aggregating asset data

393
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,229
from technical sources so route 53 is a

394
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:55,250
good one if you're on AWS you know sir

395
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:57,200
transparency DNS ad etc take those as

396
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:00,410
your source of truth aggregate them into

397
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:01,790
one list that you can then work off take

398
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:04,100
an outside-in approach you know good

399
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:05,510
place to start is focusing on what is in

400
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,190
your external attack surface and then

401
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:09,590
work your way in from there

402
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:10,820
you'd be surprised what you have exposed

403
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:13,850
to the Internet

404
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:15,230
move beyond IP based thinking so really

405
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,880
you were seeing some of these examples

406
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:19,760
these are all application security

407
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:22,250
issues this is commonly where ephemeral

408
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:23,840
vulnerabilities exist and particularly

409
00:14:22,250 --> 00:14:26,030
in organisations that are doing a lot of

410
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:27,230
development you know in their attack

411
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:29,720
surface so understanding your

412
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:31,550
application assets is key and obviously

413
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,620
the associated attack surface with that

414
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:35,510
and then seek out contacts so like

415
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:36,950
having a good whole istic list that

416
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,360
you've sort of automated and you're

417
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:40,460
taking from all these sources that's a

418
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,500
really good start but where you see a

419
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:43,790
lot of value is looking at the context

420
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,320
so you know understanding what

421
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,430
technologies are running on all those

422
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,350
assets understanding the

423
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:50,359
interconnectedness of those assets is

424
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:53,360
also very key and very helpful in

425
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:54,800
finding and ephemeral issues adopting a

426
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:57,080
continuous assessment mindset one of the

427
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,150
things you might have noticed about all

428
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:01,910
these bugs is it came because we were

429
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:04,069
constantly looking at these assets and

430
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:05,600
so this is you know when you're looking

431
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,070
at you know ephemeral vulnerabilities

432
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,230
that's that's key so you know

433
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:11,300
traditional thinking is kind of counter

434
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:13,220
to that right typically you know you run

435
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,890
a bone scan or you do a pen test and you

436
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,120
get the list and then you go in and

437
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:20,180
remediate them and then rinse and repeat

438
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,680
in like six months to a year and and you

439
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:24,140
know if you've got a really highly fluid

440
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,609
and evolving attack surface the approach

441
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,960
can't keep up the ephemeral

442
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:29,630
vulnerabilities show

443
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:31,430
up in the gaps right and depending on

444
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:33,380
your attack surface even once a month

445
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:35,239
might not be continuous enough you know

446
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,710
the bugs that we showed you know that

447
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,090
they're typically a matter of hours or

448
00:15:36,710 --> 00:15:40,100
days that they're up and they're exposed

449
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:42,530
for and as you saw like the impact is

450
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,060
great so so you know doing this

451
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:47,030
continuously is is really important

452
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:48,829
focus on you know at least a Lea or more

453
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:52,400
ideally if you can make it work hourly

454
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:53,630
vulnerability discover and here's an

455
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,850
example of what I was talking about

456
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:57,140
right so you have like a violin

457
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:59,960
sessemann you know you might do that

458
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:01,550
every quarter let's say you do a pen

459
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,490
test you know a couple of times a year

460
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:06,050
and then in the gaps that's where the

461
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:08,540
ephemeral vulnerabilities are right and

462
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:10,400
that's that's all-around visibility and

463
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:11,990
the final final strategy and

464
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:14,420
recommendation would be to focus on

465
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:15,890
impact all right so it's really focused

466
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,839
to you it's really important to focus on

467
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:20,630
security impact when you are trying to

468
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:22,550
adopt a continuous security mindset the

469
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,870
first reason being you know it reduces

470
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:26,030
the overhead you know don't bite off

471
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:28,160
more than you can chew focusing on too

472
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:29,839
much at once increases the overhead and

473
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,329
you won't get value out of that approach

474
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:34,100
you know shifting to a continual

475
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:36,260
approach means signal is really

476
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,450
important and you know focus on the

477
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:41,090
stuff that you're concerned about so we

478
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:42,770
saw C's admin panel right if you've been

479
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:44,990
owned by that before if you've seen that

480
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,610
before just focus on looking for admin

481
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:47,600
panels continuously across all your

482
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,670
assets

483
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,990
don't focus on everything else just

484
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:52,520
because you can't focus on what's going

485
00:16:50,990 --> 00:16:55,310
to have impact for you

486
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:56,390
scalability and you know this is the

487
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:58,310
other reason why you want to focus on

488
00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:00,230
impact right if you have a particularly

489
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:01,400
large attack surface you're not going to

490
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,210
be able to handle that scale

491
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,250
continuously

492
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:05,839
if you're you know wasting resources

493
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,700
looking for stuff that doesn't really

494
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,169
matter that's not really going to get

495
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:11,209
your owned and that's not really a big

496
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:13,580
risk if if it's out there and then

497
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:15,170
finally agility so you're being able to

498
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:16,970
respond to ephemeral vulnerabilities

499
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:18,560
quickly is really important in terms of

500
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:19,459
minimizing the risk yes they're

501
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,260
short-lived but they're often

502
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:22,520
high-impact and you know if it's

503
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:25,010
something that would have been up for

504
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:26,240
days but you can make it be up for or

505
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:29,629
only expose you for an hour or two

506
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:32,930
that's a win right so so focusing on the

507
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:34,700
impact helps you be more agile and yeah

508
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:37,390
that's really the end of our talk any

509
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,390
questions

510
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:46,390
no way like what moment

511
00:17:52,769 --> 00:17:59,489
thank you so you've got hourly routine

512
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:04,440
to do your monitoring how do you then do

513
00:17:59,489 --> 00:18:06,539
the alerting and how much context would

514
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:09,239
you provide in those alerts about the

515
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:11,549
problem in in the alerting mechanism

516
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:13,980
versus say hey we think something's

517
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:16,649
screwy going best agay yeah so we use

518
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:19,139
our own tooling for this and how we've

519
00:18:16,649 --> 00:18:22,049
got to set up our truly has pretty

520
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:24,899
granular settings around notifications

521
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:27,720
but we have a pipe to slack and so we

522
00:18:24,899 --> 00:18:30,539
have it where new assets are matched and

523
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:34,169
new vulnerabilities are sent immediately

524
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:36,450
and and it'll have enough context for us

525
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:38,940
to be able to go okay that's it and then

526
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:40,440
you know with you know for our sort of

527
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,879
commercial products I don't know we had

528
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:43,619
to have a commercial version of it I

529
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:45,299
wants to be a pitch but like it has a

530
00:18:43,619 --> 00:18:48,928
bit more granular settings that you can

531
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:50,820
kind of tweak but yeah it's a really it

532
00:18:48,929 --> 00:18:52,619
is actually really important because you

533
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,789
can get a notification fatigue when

534
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:55,709
you're looking at all this stuff like

535
00:18:53,789 --> 00:18:57,119
new assets new issues that's why I like

536
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:58,379
what I said like focus on the impact

537
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:59,488
right so you don't want to be bogged

538
00:18:58,379 --> 00:19:01,019
down with stuff you don't care about

539
00:18:59,489 --> 00:19:02,129
that you're not gonna react to because

540
00:19:01,019 --> 00:19:02,999
then you're gonna miss the stuff that

541
00:19:02,129 --> 00:19:05,488
you want to react to

542
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:06,389
so again notification fatigue can be can

543
00:19:05,489 --> 00:19:07,799
be an issue if you're doing this

544
00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:09,658
approach but it's really important to I

545
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:11,369
remember when I first started asset note

546
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:13,200
at the beginning I used to love getting

547
00:19:11,369 --> 00:19:14,488
notifications and then I think almost

548
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,960
six months in the development I'd get

549
00:19:14,489 --> 00:19:17,850
notifications all the time where if they

550
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,649
didn't mean anything anymore so we did

551
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:21,899
have to tackle the idea of making these

552
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:23,129
notifications worthwhile we batch them

553
00:19:21,899 --> 00:19:24,508
up in a way that it doesn't annoy you

554
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:26,279
and make sure that the signal still

555
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:27,509
remains yeah and it depends on what

556
00:19:26,279 --> 00:19:29,489
you're trying to achieve as well like

557
00:19:27,509 --> 00:19:32,279
one of the great things if you do focus

558
00:19:29,489 --> 00:19:33,960
on the impact and get high signal is you

559
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:35,070
can you know work with your dev teams

560
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,989
because they're the ones that are there

561
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:38,519
pushing out these are ephemeral issues

562
00:19:36,989 --> 00:19:40,470
if you have something that you can kind

563
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:42,600
of in whatever system that you choose or

564
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,919
however have you constructed that is

565
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,779
high signal enough that you can get sent

566
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,330
it straight to them that's like you know

567
00:19:45,779 --> 00:19:49,350
the ideal scenario and they can just fix

568
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:51,859
it straighter when you give them enough

569
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:51,859
context

570
00:19:54,930 --> 00:20:04,270
yep yeah one question here so you talk

571
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:06,850
about mitigation being around sort of

572
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:08,250
mostly process related and I'm just

573
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:11,230
curious in your scanning a you

574
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:13,030
fingerprinting these systems as well and

575
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:15,220
if you identified any particular stacks

576
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:16,899
or or technologies that are but you know

577
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:18,910
did the way this is showing up more than

578
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,560
others yeah that's a good question

579
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:22,840
actually we do finger in all of our

580
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,580
stacks so all the assets that we've got

581
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:26,010
inside we see well the technologies are

582
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:28,210
running what's more popular than others

583
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:29,920
often we find these sort of

584
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:32,550
vulnerabilities pop up on more more

585
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:35,110
modern stacks like Express Jas no js'

586
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:36,879
using you know popular front-end tools

587
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:38,290
as well really it's more than modern

588
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:40,240
applications that we're seeing this pop

589
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:41,530
buy it where there's a CI CD process

590
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,030
that's been formalized everyone's

591
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:45,399
pushing to production all the time and

592
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:46,960
even when the staging environments that

593
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,750
are up on the internet that we shouldn't

594
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:52,450
be able to access all the time yeah I

595
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:53,680
wouldn't say though that these bugs are

596
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:56,080
necessarily a symptom of the

597
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:57,520
technologies it's more the technologies

598
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,439
themselves are indicative that they

599
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,570
adopt certain practices which are more

600
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,250
likely to leave these issues so they're

601
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:05,110
more likely to be developing life

602
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:07,180
they're more likely to be pushing stuff

603
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:09,250
rapidly and we have that more DevOps in

604
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:11,830
mindset then like a traditional like

605
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:13,840
Java Enterprise shop right so it's

606
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:15,460
probably even though we are seeing like

607
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,860
the trend with the technologies it's

608
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:22,380
probably more of a symptom of of those

609
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:26,979
issues rather than the root cause itself

610
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:28,570
any further questions Michael may we ask

611
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:30,520
porting is the name of your commercial

612
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:31,870
package there yeah sorry maybe ask what

613
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,129
is the name of the commercial product

614
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:37,629
that you yes so it's absolute note

615
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:45,640
continuous security if you will probably

616
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:47,650
be at the bar so thank you very much

617
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:48,850
guys if you give a big welcome applause

618
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:50,910
to them

619
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:50,909
you
