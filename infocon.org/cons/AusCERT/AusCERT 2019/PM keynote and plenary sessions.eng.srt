1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,949
well ladies and gentlemen welcome back

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,180
till afternoon session trust you enjoyed

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:07,500
your morning to your afternoon until

4
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,809
your lunch in those parallel streets

5
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,519
during the course of the day it is of

6
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:12,570
course just a day about learning just

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,460
accumulating your information

8
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:16,560
challenging old ideas reassessing

9
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,970
paradigms if I just learnt during

10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,320
afternoon tea for example something I

11
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:23,250
never knew shepherd's pie and ice cream

12
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,150
oh what an amazing combination so what

13
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,800
I'm gonna get you to do here very

14
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:27,869
quickly because I know how exhausting

15
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,910
roles you're all here with probably one

16
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,320
or two colleagues the vast bulk of you

17
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,120
know a couple of other people outside of

18
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,070
that but don't know a lot of people in

19
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,629
the room and you're ten statistically to

20
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:38,969
clump around to be sitting next to the

21
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,620
person you know best here at the entire

22
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:42,510
conference so in a couple of seconds I'm

23
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,730
gonna get everyone to stand up quickly

24
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:46,589
spin 360 degrees the first person you

25
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,390
lock eyes on I think got an idea who you

26
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:50,640
are you're going to extend the hand say

27
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,449
who you are hello how do you fit in and

28
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,250
share with that person one thing you've

29
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:58,050
learned today all that's jumped out at

30
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,460
you from a keynote or a parallel session

31
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,589
so far that you went well didn't know

32
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,559
Wow what's one big take out you've had

33
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,030
from the day so far okay then when you

34
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,439
do sit down I'm gonna be encouraging

35
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:08,880
again if you're close to an aisle but

36
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,798
could move across one side and leave a

37
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,939
few spare ones on the aisles that's

38
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,920
easier for the people who will

39
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:17,279
inevitably come in late and not have to

40
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,960
wobble past you so let's all stand up

41
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,189
everyone stand up everyone stand on

42
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,350
let's get the energy back here for our

43
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:23,429
final session on the count of three spin

44
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,048
around one two three

45
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:27,030
make a friend shake hands how are you

46
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:29,210
one take out someone you've never met

47
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,210
before

48
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,660
great stuff okay everyone sitting down

49
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:22,209
now shuffling in one suit if you can if

50
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:23,319
it's easy to leave a spare spot on the

51
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:25,300
aisle that it'd be great if you could

52
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:25,708
shuffle along one suit if it's easy to

53
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,819
do

54
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:32,020
everyone looking back at me now on the

55
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:34,239
gone TV focus on me okay really exciting

56
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,400
afternoon session for you here ladies

57
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,990
and gentleman this next gentleman he's

58
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,730
going to talk on the concept of the data

59
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:41,560
breach pipeline there are few people

60
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,899
better qualified in the world to do so

61
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,989
he knows so much about the subject he's

62
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,310
testified before US Congress on the

63
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:49,860
impact of data breaches on

64
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,330
knowledge-based authentication

65
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,830
authentication um I think you probably

66
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:55,480
only had to watch that footage of Mark

67
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:57,519
Zuckerberg being grilled by the US

68
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,350
Congress to think they those guys really

69
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,340
know what they're talking about that

70
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:03,190
must have been a tough day at the office

71
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:05,050
for this guy who is the founder of the

72
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:08,050
data breach monitoring and notification

73
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:10,450
service have I been pwned we all know

74
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:12,250
the site that's the site that millions

75
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:14,890
of people have gone to when they have

76
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:16,840
received that email on suggesting

77
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:18,940
they've been watched doing that sort of

78
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,010
stuff your race off to this website and

79
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,109
I hypothetically I've been told suddenly

80
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,880
feel a lot better about yourself and

81
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:27,370
your ongoing employment prospects and

82
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,989
relationship with family members anyway

83
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,459
let's give him a big round of applause

84
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:32,230
gonna stage Troy hunts here like Jeff

85
00:03:30,459 --> 00:03:38,500
and Troy this is all yours the data

86
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:40,480
breach pipeline seems like that was a

87
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,750
nice intro thank you

88
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:45,730
so normally I'd sort of start off by

89
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:48,010
saying that does anyone know this

90
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:51,090
website but it's probably not much point

91
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:53,890
now who has used this out of interest

92
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:55,150
Wow okay I've got stickers for all of

93
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:57,880
you too you want to come and get them

94
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:59,049
later on so this is a recap have I been

95
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,100
point is a data breach notification

96
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:04,810
service when we have large data breaches

97
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:07,000
Dropbox LinkedIn Ashley Madison stuff

98
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,670
like that data gets spread out all the

99
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,109
way around the world I a grenade it load

100
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,119
it into that system then you can go and

101
00:04:11,109 --> 00:04:14,140
figure out where being exposed our

102
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,910
companies can go and do things like

103
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:18,269
domain searchers figure out who in the

104
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:20,500
organization has say a Dropbox account

105
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:24,400
it's kind of interesting for a lot of

106
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:27,280
companies and the the interesting thing

107
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,479
about this service is it started off as

108
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,520
something very

109
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:33,938
back in 2013 so this was like the first

110
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,889
tweet ever and I thought this would be

111
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:38,499
good like a few mo mates will use it

112
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:39,699
it'll be interesting not everyone

113
00:04:38,499 --> 00:04:41,379
thought it was always going to be a good

114
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:45,999
idea they thought I was gonna be like

115
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:47,529
running as spam harvesting site but the

116
00:04:45,999 --> 00:04:49,779
funny thing about is is like Adam said

117
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:52,270
it kind of took on a bit of a life of

118
00:04:49,779 --> 00:04:54,969
its own and and became something much

119
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:57,849
bigger to the point where it it ended me

120
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:59,770
up over here and you know like he made

121
00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:02,409
it sound very serious and it was kind of

122
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:03,849
serious I had to get dressed up

123
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:06,669
everything you see me wearing there I

124
00:05:03,849 --> 00:05:08,560
had to buy so I'm dressed up but today

125
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:09,878
because I live on the Gold Coast but I

126
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,669
had to put clothes shoes on and things

127
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:14,229
like that and I kind of didn't want to

128
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:15,938
make it too serious either like it's

129
00:05:14,229 --> 00:05:18,128
it's a big event but you know let's have

130
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:18,789
some fun and I thought I should get some

131
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:22,449
cool socks

132
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:23,919
and I actually tweeted out I said has

133
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:26,370
anyone got some nice socks they want to

134
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,839
send me so so Foss sent me these socks

135
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:31,120
says for those about the code we salute

136
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:33,069
you and I thought I'll it'll be a bit of

137
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,310
fun and it'll just you know lighten the

138
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:38,139
mood a bit and it turns out that the

139
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:40,689
socks were quite popular and you can

140
00:05:38,139 --> 00:05:45,120
even now go and buy a stock photo of my

141
00:05:40,689 --> 00:05:47,199
socks 199 dollars off Shutterstock and

142
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,610
that the sort of thing that struck me

143
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,110
the other day is like how did this like

144
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,639
little project somehow end me up in

145
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:55,959
Congress with people taking photos and

146
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:57,339
selling my socks so several years on the

147
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:59,379
thing keeps growing growing because we

148
00:05:57,339 --> 00:06:00,759
do have so many different data breaches

149
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:02,469
happening pretty much every day like

150
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:04,209
every day I look at my Twitter feed as a

151
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:06,069
bunch of people saying hey Cece Troy

152
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:07,180
hunt have you seen for example today

153
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:09,819
it's Flipboard everyone's getting

154
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,860
Flipboard notifications that was canva a

155
00:06:09,819 --> 00:06:13,779
couple of days ago there's always

156
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,520
something now thought of the Internet is

157
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:16,990
sort of have a look at who is behind a

158
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,520
lot of these breaches as well because I

159
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,819
think there's a perception which is

160
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:22,839
often really different to the reality

161
00:06:20,819 --> 00:06:26,020
and I'll give you a good example of this

162
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:29,499
so this is Talk Talk now Talk Talk is a

163
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:32,979
massive UK telco and they had a breach

164
00:06:29,499 --> 00:06:36,399
in 2015 that they said customs 77

165
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:40,209
million pounds like a massive massive

166
00:06:36,399 --> 00:06:42,879
amount of money now at the time when

167
00:06:40,209 --> 00:06:44,949
they had the incident it was a

168
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:47,709
detective who came out and he was quoted

169
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:50,469
as saying we think it is Russian Islamic

170
00:06:47,709 --> 00:06:53,050
cyber jihad ease this is a true

171
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:55,558
statement and it like it just kind of

172
00:06:53,050 --> 00:07:00,279
feels like he just picked scary words

173
00:06:55,559 --> 00:07:02,139
and put them all on the page and as best

174
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:04,240
I know it is none of these things other

175
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:07,479
than maybe cyber which let's face it is

176
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,659
a little bit generic so it turns out it

177
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:13,990
was actually this guy and he's leaving

178
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:16,050
court here after having to answer for

179
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:21,219
his actions you can't see his face

180
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:23,259
because it's a 17 year old child 77

181
00:07:21,219 --> 00:07:27,610
million pounds of damage 17 year old

182
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:30,219
child now he was actually 16 when he

183
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:31,360
broke in to talk talk using sequel map

184
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:34,659
freely available sequel injection

185
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:37,419
software did the 77 million pounds with

186
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:38,789
the damage the lawmakers there took it

187
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:42,878
quite seriously

188
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:44,619
they took his iPhone away which like in

189
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:47,619
fairness for a 17 year old is probably

190
00:07:44,619 --> 00:07:49,449
like hell right but the thing that

191
00:07:47,619 --> 00:07:51,519
strikes me is how often it is like

192
00:07:49,449 --> 00:07:53,259
children who are breaking into these

193
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:55,749
systems even great big multinationals

194
00:07:53,259 --> 00:07:57,490
and that the thing about kids and

195
00:07:55,749 --> 00:08:00,009
hacking these days is they have access

196
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:02,709
to so much material to be able to do

197
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:04,539
this and I want to give you an example I

198
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:07,379
went over to YouTube and I thought look

199
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:09,459
all I'll pull a video that demonstrates

200
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:12,099
hacking and there's a gazillion of them

201
00:08:09,459 --> 00:08:15,189
on YouTube I thought I'll pull one which

202
00:08:12,099 --> 00:08:17,429
is probably shows how simplistic the

203
00:08:15,189 --> 00:08:20,979
threat actor for one of a better term is

204
00:08:17,429 --> 00:08:22,599
have a quick listen to this guy let's do

205
00:08:20,979 --> 00:08:26,079
a professional video let's actually show

206
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:30,369
you how the concept works and I'm using

207
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:35,110
them the SQL or school method here a

208
00:08:30,369 --> 00:08:36,939
school injection it's like as mayor

209
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:38,259
right is this and I don't know if it's a

210
00:08:36,938 --> 00:08:43,088
squirrel or a chipmunk but I know it's

211
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:45,399
not a sequel so you've got kids creating

212
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:46,600
videos about how to break into systems

213
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,430
you gonna see what he does next in the

214
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:51,250
moment and they literally can't even

215
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:52,779
pronounce sequel so anyway he starts

216
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,160
doing this tutorial and he goes off and

217
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:55,950
he does his google dork and he wants to

218
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,390
find websites that

219
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:58,680
have a query string parameter in them

220
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:01,560
that he can then take and put into

221
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,969
automated software so he ends up on this

222
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:05,520
site here and this is a gold bullion

223
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:08,130
trading site so have a look what he does

224
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:09,870
once he gets over here okay so with this

225
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:13,500
extension what we do is put a little

226
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:17,220
apostrophe here no comma ish put it

227
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:19,530
there press ENTER and then okay so this

228
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,810
means that we have an error in the

229
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:26,010
database so there's an error in their

230
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:29,219
database so and their database is my SQL

231
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:32,790
Server there you so a because it to my

232
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:38,790
skill hormones go out we can target it

233
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:40,439
and grab all the info now one thing to

234
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:41,790
think about here as well is what do you

235
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,710
think it's like the kids sitting at home

236
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:45,240
watching this stuff right like they

237
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:47,190
don't have that moral compass yet of

238
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,050
what it means to do what he's beginning

239
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:51,120
to do because he's just out of parameter

240
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:52,560
tampering he's putting apostrophe in

241
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,390
there somewhere some are in the

242
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,310
application they concatenate in whatever

243
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:58,260
that crew string value is into a sequel

244
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:00,839
query obviously not doing any

245
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:04,620
sanitization parameterization he's

246
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:06,990
established to proof he grabs the URL

247
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:09,360
goes and throws in a havoc free sequel

248
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,680
injection software shows you how to pull

249
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,310
out all the email addresses all the

250
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:16,650
passwords and then he logs into the site

251
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:18,000
with them now like I was watching this

252
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:20,220
and going oh it's one thing to do this

253
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:24,320
it's another thing to video yourself

254
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:28,170
doing it and put it on YouTube as a

255
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:29,580
tutorial for other people so once he's

256
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:32,610
authenticated he can pull out banking

257
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:34,500
data and this is a child whose voices

258
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:37,970
probably just break in can't yet

259
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,930
pronounce sequel it's just too easy so

260
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:42,060
one of the things that I think the

261
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:44,760
industry's starting to focus on a little

262
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:47,310
bit more is how do we tackle this like

263
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:50,730
how do we start to think about getting

264
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:53,339
kids on the right pathway and the NCAA

265
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:55,830
in the UK is starting to focus on this

266
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:57,240
quite a bit as well so I want to show

267
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:59,370
you this a little short clip here I got

268
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,710
this advertisement of how they're trying

269
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,390
to reach parents it's a little bit of

270
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:06,210
fun but have a think about how

271
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:08,430
representative this is of most parents

272
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:09,370
out there whose kids hacking away in

273
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,439
their bedroom in the

274
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:16,600
sort of absolutely no idea what they're

275
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:20,590
doing oh he's such a clever boy boy mr.

276
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:22,600
Queen spends all night oh listen how

277
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:24,730
smart is this you know them shooter

278
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,190
games the other day he was losing so he

279
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:30,130
crashed the server Papa wizkid it's

280
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:32,220
amazing what kids can do these days no

281
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:34,900
darling or what did they call it

282
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:37,180
ddossing that's it I saw it on the telly

283
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:40,120
please no dasa they were only a hundred

284
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:41,770
percent in maths every single exam for

285
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,410
the last two years not to mention his

286
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:48,579
GCSE coursework that's gonna go down the

287
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:52,870
m11 to Cambridge Computer Sciences

288
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:54,550
degree top career in computing internet

289
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:58,840
billionaire by the time he's 25 the next

290
00:11:54,550 --> 00:12:05,079
steve gates I know he's very clever but

291
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:08,760
his money too we only give him a tenner

292
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,760
a week doubles he robbed a bank

293
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:17,010
and that the thing is like it's very

294
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:19,650
close to the truth right most parents

295
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:22,200
have got no idea about the technology

296
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:23,670
that their kids are using and then the

297
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,020
kids don't yet have that moral compass

298
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:27,930
and we end up with things like what we

299
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:29,490
saw just before now cause a lot of these

300
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,900
breaches impact passwords we saw

301
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:32,400
passwords on the previous screen who

302
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,709
used them to then go and authenticate to

303
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:37,260
the app so I thought it'd be worthwhile

304
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:38,550
just recapping on on passwords briefly

305
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,750
in terms of where we've come from and

306
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,990
where we're going as well because

307
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:44,280
there's a lot that is actually changing

308
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:47,820
and on that first bit the bit where

309
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:49,199
we've come from this is MIT in the 60s

310
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:51,270
and this is believed to be the

311
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,520
first-ever case of having a password on

312
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:55,560
a computer system so this was a

313
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:58,530
compatible time sharing system you'd go

314
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,209
into this room of computer and you'd log

315
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:01,740
in and then you would have access to

316
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:04,070
whatever it is you did with a computer

317
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:07,560
that filled up a room back in the 60s

318
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:10,260
now if we think about the threats we had

319
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,869
then and the threat actors and the

320
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:14,280
access that they needed first of all I

321
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,930
had to have physical access you had to

322
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:18,470
be in the room this was not a connected

323
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:20,400
system you couldn't go home and dial in

324
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:23,040
when you got in there you need a

325
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,120
sophisticated knowledge I don't know

326
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,770
what you do when you get in there maybe

327
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,360
take Miko's punch card from this morning

328
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:28,439
and put it in on something who knows but

329
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,910
you've got to know what you're doing

330
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:34,230
which is really different to today

331
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:35,760
there's no password reuse because it was

332
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:38,370
the first system that had a password so

333
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:40,920
there's that problem gone and you could

334
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:44,760
use basic passwords because your risk

335
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:46,800
surface was so small but the way

336
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,930
passwords worked back then the first

337
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,550
time ever it's still pretty much the

338
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,810
same as they work today you've got two

339
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,099
strings in your head ones are using they

340
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,959
ones you password if the ones in your

341
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:59,280
head match the ones in your system you

342
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:01,020
get to log in job done but the 60s is

343
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:03,750
very very different to today yet the

344
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:07,170
same mechanism is how pretty much every

345
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:08,400
system we use today works so that was

346
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,719
the sixties now we move forward go

347
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:12,530
forward a couple of decades get to the

348
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,480
80s we start getting connected systems

349
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:18,930
so this was a press tell and press tell

350
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:20,520
was used by about 90,000 people you'd

351
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:22,050
plug this computer into your TV because

352
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,150
we didn't have computer monitors in the

353
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:26,149
home at the time you'd plug it into a

354
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:29,360
modem and you dial in

355
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:32,810
once you dialed in you doth entik eight

356
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:36,570
this is a little BBC clip which shows

357
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:38,279
how to log in to the press tell the rest

358
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:43,160
of computers now ask me to enter my own

359
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:43,160
personal password which I've now done

360
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:52,199
here I get that let's zoom in enhance

361
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,859
see what's going on right like one two

362
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:55,199
three four

363
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,730
so what we're sort of seeing here is

364
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,560
humans taking the path of least

365
00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:00,120
resistance it's like ah something's in

366
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,130
my way how quickly can I get around this

367
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:04,230
thing not much quicker than one two

368
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,819
three four I assume the minimum length

369
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,810
of the password was four otherwise it

370
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:09,779
would have been one two three or

371
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:12,479
something like that so this is now more

372
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:13,709
problematic than MIT in the 60s because

373
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,199
it's a connected system you've got

374
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:18,899
people remote you've got more people

375
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:22,439
with enough knowledge to use the system

376
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:23,610
compared to the 60s we go forward

377
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,500
another couple of decades get to

378
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:28,259
Internet era get to the 90s we've got

379
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:31,649
millions of websites billions of people

380
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:33,480
using them and people are using bad

381
00:15:31,649 --> 00:15:34,319
passwords like in the press tell so we

382
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,110
said all right we're going to fix this

383
00:15:34,319 --> 00:15:39,120
the way we're going to fix this is we're

384
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:42,060
going to create password complexity

385
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:43,560
rules now we've got a bit of file

386
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,849
footage of Bob here at Bob's trying to

387
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,469
create an account on a website and the

388
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:49,290
website says to keep your password

389
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:50,730
secure it must have at least one

390
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:52,920
lowercase character at least one

391
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:54,810
uppercase character it's got to have a

392
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,610
number it's got to have a non

393
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:59,099
alphanumeric character it's got to be at

394
00:15:56,610 --> 00:16:00,750
least eight characters long you can't

395
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:05,480
have used it in any of the last three

396
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:08,100
passwords and now Bob is losing his mind

397
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:11,399
because he can't create a password and

398
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:16,260
we have all been there right it is

399
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:18,959
painful so what do we do we create

400
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:23,540
passwords like this and this is a good

401
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:26,250
password cricket's okay

402
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:28,829
it is a good password by the

403
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:30,470
mathematical definition of what most

404
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:32,339
people think makes a good password

405
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:34,410
because think it through right you got

406
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:35,820
upper case lower case number non

407
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:39,510
alphanumeric that's actually 15

408
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:41,990
characters long too yet we look at this

409
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:45,510
as humans and we recognize patterns and

410
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:47,400
we think we'll know maybe maybe there's

411
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:50,970
more to password strength than just

412
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:53,730
mathematics yet still it meets that

413
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:55,320
basic criteria and any one of you could

414
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:59,060
go back to your places of work on Monday

415
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:01,800
and create this password at the office

416
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:05,428
now if you did that what is going to

417
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:08,389
happen 90 days from now got a rotator

418
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:13,079
right what are gonna do 90 days from now

419
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:14,550
you put a 1 on the end and the funny

420
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,899
thing is every time I do this look

421
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:17,129
there's always everyone that's going

422
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:18,449
yeah you just put a 1 on the end cuz you

423
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:22,770
all do it I know you do it I've seen

424
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:25,559
your passwords so so we do this and

425
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:29,010
again it's humans circumventing the

426
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:31,710
controls that get put in place we know

427
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:33,300
this the hackers know this like I hate

428
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:37,200
to break it to you they have worked this

429
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:39,540
stuff out and time goes by and we just

430
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,050
keep incrementing the number because

431
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:44,909
this thing is in our way and there's a

432
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:46,260
fun trick you can do so take the number

433
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:48,270
that's at the end of your password right

434
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:50,160
now divide it by 4 that's how long

435
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:53,760
you've been at the company works doesn't

436
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:56,640
it so this is all very very predictable

437
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,379
we know what's happening but what

438
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:00,600
happens is when we enforce arbitrary

439
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:04,140
complexity rules and we force rotation

440
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:06,240
people take shortcuts they do things to

441
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:09,540
try and remember what the password was

442
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,850
which actually weakens it I'll give you

443
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:14,490
a perfect example of this remember last

444
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:15,750
year in Hawaii that emergency response

445
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:17,070
system went off and everyone thought I

446
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,010
were going to get bombed because their

447
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:21,360
phone started getting all the messages

448
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:22,890
they went and interviewed this guy

449
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,260
afterwards and he's here in this

450
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:26,520
emergency response center and they're

451
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,960
kind of interviewing me know like what

452
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,840
happened why did the thing go off where

453
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,220
they're real any bombs and he's standing

454
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:36,309
in front of the screens there and

455
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:38,919
there's something alarming down here

456
00:18:36,309 --> 00:18:40,908
they're still using Internet Explorer

457
00:18:38,919 --> 00:18:44,059
and he's got his password paste

458
00:18:40,909 --> 00:18:46,639
on-screen and this is what happens and

459
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:48,860
again is people trying to find the

460
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:50,899
shortcuts around the controls that are

461
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:52,158
standing between them and doing the

462
00:18:50,899 --> 00:18:55,969
thing that they're there to do in the

463
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:57,769
first place so this is changing and

464
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:58,909
here's where it gets sort of interesting

465
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:01,039
there's a couple of really interesting

466
00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:02,809
things that are starting to come out

467
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:05,480
from industry bodies about how we should

468
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:07,668
do this differently and the first one

469
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:09,049
thought we'd touch on is from nest so a

470
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:13,190
nest came out a couple years ago and

471
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:14,570
said we should not impose composition

472
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:18,049
rules for memorized secrets

473
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:20,289
so verifiers applications shouldn't say

474
00:19:18,049 --> 00:19:23,080
uppercase lowercase alphanumeric

475
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:25,309
because it's such a predictable result

476
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,049
yeah you think about if you're gonna try

477
00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:28,279
to just use a lowercase password and it

478
00:19:27,049 --> 00:19:29,840
says now you got to have an uppercase as

479
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:31,580
well yeah okay so your uppercase the

480
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,899
first character got to have a number as

481
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,399
well you put a 1 on the end got to have

482
00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:36,379
a non alphanumeric character you put an

483
00:19:34,399 --> 00:19:39,459
exclamation mark on the end it is so

484
00:19:36,379 --> 00:19:41,899
predictable time and time and time again

485
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:46,250
stop requiring this because people take

486
00:19:41,899 --> 00:19:50,149
shortcuts make things worse the NCSC in

487
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:51,769
the UK around the similar time City

488
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:53,479
should only ask users to change their

489
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:55,879
passwords on indication suspicions are

490
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,129
compromised unless you think the

491
00:19:55,879 --> 00:20:02,029
password has been compromised stop

492
00:19:58,129 --> 00:20:03,408
forcing people to rotate it now they

493
00:20:02,029 --> 00:20:05,570
don't just say get rid of stuff either

494
00:20:03,409 --> 00:20:07,129
they say look stop doing that but there

495
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:10,189
are other things that we can do now that

496
00:20:07,129 --> 00:20:12,889
we couldn't do before we have almost

497
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:14,690
ubiquitous 2fa we've got things like u2f

498
00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:16,610
tokens we've got user behavioral

499
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:19,309
analytics we can see deviations from the

500
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:20,840
norm we've also got more encrypted

501
00:20:19,309 --> 00:20:22,730
networks than ever as well so the

502
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,799
exposure of passwords is different to

503
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:28,610
what it was say even just 10 years ago

504
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:30,168
let learn 20 years so this is how

505
00:20:28,610 --> 00:20:31,969
passwords are evolving and how we need

506
00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:34,850
to start thinking differently about them

507
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:36,259
and over time these will start to filter

508
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,730
through more Microsoft just recently

509
00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:40,669
updated a bunch of their baseline

510
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:42,559
guidance for Windows Server and for

511
00:20:40,669 --> 00:20:46,309
desktop PCs so look we're going to

512
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:47,950
remove the rotation requirement things

513
00:20:46,309 --> 00:20:50,260
are progressing

514
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:53,840
they also on the subject of passwords

515
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:56,740
we're seeing huge exposures of them in

516
00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:01,159
numbers that we've never seen before

517
00:20:56,740 --> 00:21:03,410
this was in January and there emerged

518
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:05,510
what was referred to as collection one

519
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:08,750
and collection one was a list of

520
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:09,950
usernames and passwords pairs often

521
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:13,210
referred to as a credential stuffing

522
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:15,050
lists someone sent this data to me and

523
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:16,910
turned out there were seven hundred

524
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:19,100
seventy three million email addresses in

525
00:21:16,910 --> 00:21:21,020
there there were more than a billion

526
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,909
passwords because many email addresses

527
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:24,830
had more than one password and this was

528
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:27,280
an amalgamation of different breaches

529
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:29,480
from different services I was in there

530
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:32,960
including a password I'd used in the

531
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:37,970
past and people take these lists and

532
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,330
then exploit the victims why I picked it

533
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:41,270
up

534
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:43,850
CNET picked it up 21 million unique

535
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:44,930
passwords also do the math seven hundred

536
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,669
and seventy three million emails but

537
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,950
only twenty-one million unique passwords

538
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:52,250
what does that tell you not so good at

539
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:53,600
the passwords fortune I always find the

540
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,400
fortune stuff interesting because now

541
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,689
it's like consumer mainstream media this

542
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,190
is not just technical people anymore

543
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:01,340
it's the sort of thing my parents would

544
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:02,570
read here's how to find out if your

545
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,949
email address was one of them they sent

546
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:05,149
people to have I been part I got 10

547
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:09,110
million people come to the site in the

548
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:12,410
day that was fun I don't think I've

549
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:14,479
recovered quite yet now often you see

550
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:15,440
this sort of stuff and a combination of

551
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,600
the press and I think a lot of the

552
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,160
masses they go are must have been on the

553
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,540
dark web because I keep hearing about

554
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,190
the dark web the dark web sounds very

555
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,480
scary this is where the criminals go on

556
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:26,360
they distribute the data and they sell

557
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:29,090
the drugs and everything now a lot of

558
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:32,090
this is on the dark web it's also on

559
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:34,490
Twitter and this is the reality of it

560
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:36,590
most of the time when people send me

561
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:38,150
data is floating around the clear web I

562
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,530
know it doesn't sound as scary and I'm

563
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,790
so sorry for the vendors who are trying

564
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:42,080
to sell stuff just based on what's on

565
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:45,620
the dark web but a lot of it is just

566
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,810
floating around in the clear so this

567
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:50,870
says you can see its collections 135 I

568
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:54,470
had collection 1 773 million unique

569
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:58,370
email addresses that was about 8% of all

570
00:22:54,470 --> 00:23:00,320
the collections combined so this float

571
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:01,040
around Twitter it's on mega Diane said a

572
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,629
lot of the

573
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:06,250
oh I see gets redistributed on mega

574
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:08,060
because it's a good file-sharing service

575
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:10,100
raises the question now what do people

576
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:11,659
do with this right so imagine you've got

577
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,610
let's say round numbers you got a

578
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:15,530
billion email address password

579
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:18,949
combinations what do you then do with

580
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:21,520
them I won't put a bit of a clip there's

581
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:24,500
another tutorial about how to abuse

582
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:26,510
credential pairs so what we're gonna see

583
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:30,770
is how to mount a credential stuffing

584
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:32,690
attack or what is going on with these no

585
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:34,400
welcome back to a brand new video here

586
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:36,170
on the channel now in this video I'm

587
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,150
gonna be showing you guys a checker of

588
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:41,360
me for Spotify account so you can check

589
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:43,700
if the accounts are valid now Spotify

590
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,320
really really frequently features as the

591
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:46,520
target of credential stuffing attack so

592
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,590
I get emails from people all the time

593
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,879
they go hey did you see Spotify had a

594
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:52,300
data breach because a whole bunch of

595
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:55,370
credentials have appeared on paste bin

596
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:57,889
now this is not generally what has

597
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:59,780
happened and we're gonna see as this guy

598
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:02,930
goes through the process how Spotify has

599
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:04,910
a air quotes data breach so let's have a

600
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:06,650
look at the checker he's made but before

601
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:08,900
we start I just want to say that this is

602
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:10,910
for educational purposes only and this

603
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,710
is obviously not made for checking

604
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:14,480
cracked accounts you guys know one of me

605
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:16,760
this is for checking your own accounts

606
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,500
if you guys got multiple so you guys

607
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,780
don't have to check one by one and this

608
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:23,270
will make it a lot easier alright so

609
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:26,570
let's just be clear about this you have

610
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:29,480
so many Spotify accounts you can't

611
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:31,970
remember which ones work any more so you

612
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:34,400
need this script to go and check your

613
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:36,860
credentials keep this in mind it will

614
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,050
also tell you guys if the account is a

615
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:42,740
Spotify premiums by 2phi family or a

616
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:44,090
Spotify student whatever you have so

617
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:47,060
many you also can't remember what type

618
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:48,409
of account you created but you'd like to

619
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:51,080
know it would be nice if there was a

620
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:52,880
tool to help you establish this but

621
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,530
before you open this actual program

622
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,300
you're gonna make sure you have combos

623
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:58,700
all right as we start to get to the

624
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:01,520
pointy end of it so combos are username

625
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:02,930
password combinations and we're seeing

626
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,520
like one tiny tiny little bit of a

627
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:06,470
snapshot of what a credential stuffing

628
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:08,690
list looks like email address password

629
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:12,080
over and over and over again a billion

630
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:13,160
times so let's have a look at what he

631
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,470
does with the combo

632
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:18,140
you're gonna typing combos and then

633
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:20,090
threads let's do four this time so it

634
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:21,950
goes a bit faster so as you guys can see

635
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:23,449
already we got eight hits as you guys

636
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:26,270
can see it keeps getting hit because

637
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:28,040
these accounts are high quality aka HQ

638
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:29,389
as you guys can see we keep getting hits

639
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,730
I don't care if you guys steal these

640
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:32,320
accounts I have about 9,000 at the

641
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:35,930
moment

642
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:39,980
well here's two it's rather miraculous

643
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:41,810
isn't it now all he's done here is his

644
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:43,580
script he's gone to his Spotify and he's

645
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:45,320
had a look let's ask the Spotify API for

646
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,760
example sits behind the mobile app he's

647
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,649
looked at it he said okay what's the

648
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,330
HTTP request pattern which logs on

649
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:51,980
that's a post request to this path

650
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:53,929
there's a field called password and a

651
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:55,670
field called user name I'm just going to

652
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:57,080
automate that and then I'm going to

653
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:59,300
multi thread it and I'm going to pass in

654
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,480
a big list go outside and play Bob's

655
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:04,460
your uncle now he's got 9,000 accounts

656
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:07,130
the challenge for us and challenge for

657
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:09,590
you guys is how do you defend against

658
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:11,420
that how do you defend against a request

659
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:13,100
coming to your site legitimate username

660
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:15,920
legitimate and password but not the

661
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:18,500
actual person that owns it and this is

662
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:20,750
becoming a really really big problem and

663
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:22,520
there are so many tutorials like this

664
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:24,050
out there I wrote a blog post recently

665
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,150
about the fact that most of these

666
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:27,440
Spotify breaches I say just successful

667
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:29,930
credential stuffing and I embedded a

668
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,160
video and then it got taken offline so I

669
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:33,830
embedded another one and I got taken

670
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:35,420
offline so I embedded this one and it's

671
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:38,540
still there there's just a heap of them

672
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:40,850
they're all over YouTube so data

673
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:44,710
breaches and passwords are a massive

674
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:48,260
thing data breaches and connected things

675
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:51,050
are also becoming a massive thing and I

676
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:53,180
thought I'd touch on a few which have

677
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:55,520
hit either have I been poned or my radar

678
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:58,520
in recent times and the first ones this

679
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:01,820
one has anyone got one of these thank

680
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:03,920
God okay so here's the value proposition

681
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,710
this is a cloud pet so imagine you've

682
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:08,450
got a kid in bed you know wanting to

683
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:10,400
talk to Mum cuz she's working late and

684
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:12,500
phones are boring so why not get them a

685
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:15,500
connected teddy bear with a microphone

686
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:18,500
in it and put it in their bed I know so

687
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,850
anyway this is what they were they're

688
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,560
basically dead now the company's gone

689
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:22,939
bankrupt but they're connected teddy

690
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,320
bears they've got a little light that

691
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,430
flashes when a message comes in they've

692
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,780
got a button in the poor they've got a

693
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:30,110
microphone I've got a speaker

694
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:32,930
now when you record a message through

695
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:36,500
this it goes up into the magic of the

696
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:39,170
cloud and it's stored up their cloud

697
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:43,550
pets stored all of their data in a

698
00:27:39,170 --> 00:27:48,010
MongoDB publicly facing without a

699
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:50,240
password and then it looked like this

700
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:51,620
your database is backed up in our

701
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:55,420
service send one Bitcoin to this address

702
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:57,739
and send your IP to that email address

703
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:59,300
now there are about five hundred and

704
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:01,550
sixty odd thousand accounts and there

705
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:03,129
someone did grab them sent them to me

706
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:05,770
for ever been pwned

707
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:08,090
but then it later got ransomed like this

708
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:09,200
now we know that this is what it looks

709
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:10,580
like because we pulled logs at a

710
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,080
showdown and we can go back and actually

711
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:15,350
see the state of the database at the

712
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,240
time we also know that to other people

713
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:20,840
subsequently came along and change the

714
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:22,550
Bitcoin address to their own which okay

715
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,050
it is kind of alright you know you don't

716
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:29,360
have to do the crime maybe you get some

717
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:31,580
of the proceeds incidently no way it's

718
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,889
backed up either it's just been Newt and

719
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:36,470
the thing is is that this happened and

720
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:38,380
then the cloud pets came back online and

721
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:43,190
nobody got told

722
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:47,120
so obviously the company knew continuing

723
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:48,560
the IOT thread we're seeing IOT in all

724
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,010
sorts of places we never had it before

725
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:53,929
in cars for example so this is an S and

726
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:56,660
leaf the nests and leaf has a companion

727
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:58,180
app so that you can do things like pull

728
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:01,970
back the battery status it's an Eevee

729
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:04,820
you can pull back the trip history you

730
00:29:01,970 --> 00:29:08,060
can also control features of the car so

731
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:10,340
you can turn the heating on I was in

732
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:12,230
Norway doing a workshop and we do this

733
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,480
exercise where you you take your phone

734
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:15,890
you route it through your PC you have a

735
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,660
look at the traffic going backwards and

736
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,950
forwards just by naturally using an API

737
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,840
and actually using an app they'd hit

738
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:22,310
take the eyes and you draw certain

739
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:25,550
conclusions about the security posture

740
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:27,620
and one of the blokes in my workshop had

741
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:32,090
one of these cars and he was curious he

742
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:33,649
said I wonder how my phone knows which

743
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:35,840
car to turn the heater on

744
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:36,920
because in Norway it's so cold you've

745
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,240
got to be able to turn the heater on

746
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,930
before you get into or you freeze to

747
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:42,960
death or something like that

748
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:44,820
so as alright this must be some sort of

749
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:47,250
API care but maybe it's a bearer token

750
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:49,260
or something stored within the app and

751
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:50,670
then when I go and turn the heater on

752
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,560
since the bearer token over a secure

753
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:55,530
connection turns on my card doesn't mess

754
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:57,360
with anyone elses car so he proxies his

755
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:59,970
phone through his PC he looks at the

756
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:03,449
traffic and he discovers that the API

757
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:06,750
key so the secret that allows you to

758
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:10,020
control features of a car is printed in

759
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:14,670
the windscreen of the car they used the

760
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:15,990
VIN number as the API key now not only

761
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:17,370
is it printed in the windscreen of a car

762
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:19,260
so you can walk around and start taking

763
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:21,590
photos of cars and go in my car my car

764
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:23,850
my car you can also enumerate them

765
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:25,230
because the last five digits you can

766
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:29,459
just keep guessing numbers and finding

767
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:31,560
more cars and this was another example

768
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:32,970
of how hard it is also to get

769
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,169
organizations to the right thing so

770
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:36,570
after we found this I got in touch with

771
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:38,640
ness and privately and said look I think

772
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:41,360
you should kind of fix your cars because

773
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:44,270
this isn't real good and I said yeah

774
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,260
we'll fix it this is very important and

775
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:49,260
eventually they just grew a bit tired of

776
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:51,360
it they stopped answering my emails and

777
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,590
it took a month before I discovered that

778
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,030
someone else had found the same

779
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:56,070
vulnerability and the way I discovered

780
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:57,960
this is there's a forum where people

781
00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:00,270
were commenting on how terrible the

782
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:02,100
mobile app is and someone reverse

783
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:03,930
engineered it and said hey look all you

784
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,340
got to do is go to this URL replace the

785
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:08,280
VIN number with yours put that as a

786
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:09,449
favorite in your browser and then when

787
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:14,190
you get up in the morning you go to the

788
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:15,570
bookmark job done heaters on so that had

789
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:17,520
to go public because they wouldn't fix

790
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:20,669
it they decided it was important after

791
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,050
it went public amazing thing and this is

792
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:24,750
one of the issues we see organizations

793
00:31:22,050 --> 00:31:28,230
having trouble dealing with security

794
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:30,140
incidents as well we had an issue just

795
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:32,940
locally only a couple of months ago

796
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:34,890
similar sort of deal there's a company

797
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:38,430
called tick-tock track and they make a

798
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:39,960
GPS tracking watch for kids in fact they

799
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:42,180
don't actually make the watch the watch

800
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:43,950
is made by a company called Gator they

801
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:45,480
make the application layer that sits on

802
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:48,690
top of it they make the mobile app they

803
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:51,540
make the api's and a mate of mine in the

804
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:52,780
UK a guy from a pen testing firm called

805
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:54,039
Ken Munro

806
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,750
ken reached out and he said look we've

807
00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:58,929
been looking at a bunch of these watches

808
00:31:55,750 --> 00:32:00,970
and they're kind of as terrible as what

809
00:31:58,929 --> 00:32:03,760
you would expect a really cheap internet

810
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:05,409
connected device to be and they'd found

811
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,658
a whole bunch of problems in late 2017

812
00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:10,059
in fact that found so many problems that

813
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:11,980
we had things like Norwegian consumer

814
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:13,110
protection council saying just don't get

815
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:15,100
these things

816
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:16,809
Germany banned them they're just like

817
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:18,129
nope destroy them they literally said

818
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:19,658
destroy them because they're all so

819
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:22,750
sharp - she's listening devices you'll

820
00:32:19,659 --> 00:32:24,190
see this in a moment so he believed that

821
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:26,830
there was a security vulnerability in

822
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:29,230
these he needed someone in Australia so

823
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:31,928
he called me when and got one of these

824
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:33,610
and I had to go to the website in order

825
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:35,350
to purchase it so I went to the site and

826
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:40,120
then I saw there was a padlock and I

827
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:42,070
felt much better no not really also

828
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:44,678
noticed in that second power there it

829
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:46,360
says we take the security of your data

830
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:49,270
seriously now normally when I see

831
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:50,740
someone say that it's in the breach

832
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:53,530
notice which is explaining how they just

833
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:57,130
didn't so it's not really a good leading

834
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:58,510
statement in my experience so anyway I

835
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:59,890
thought I'll go and get one anyway

836
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:02,289
because this is interesting right like

837
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:03,640
we want to see is this vulnerability

838
00:33:02,289 --> 00:33:06,220
which Ken believes is in the watch

839
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:07,830
actually there so I wouldn't got one and

840
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:10,450
I put it on my six-year-old daughter

841
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:12,460
so this is L and as you can see it's

842
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:14,440
it's branded gator it's made by Gator in

843
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:17,950
China and then tick tock Trek put there

844
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:20,799
a player on top and we started having a

845
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:25,150
look at the api's and we found an api

846
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:26,559
like this and it says yeah get users

847
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:28,539
this is going to pull back information

848
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:31,600
about the family and all you do is pass

849
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:36,549
through an ID now because Kansas smart

850
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:38,320
guy and he can count he can hack so all

851
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:40,690
he did is change the number change the

852
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,100
number another family like this is the

853
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:45,429
level of sophistication these are

854
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:48,340
physical devices that we're using to

855
00:33:45,429 --> 00:33:50,620
look after our children so when you hit

856
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,570
that API response comes back it says

857
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:54,939
here's your family we get a whole bunch

858
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:59,070
of JSON back here there's my email

859
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:59,070
address name

860
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:03,220
then you can start making calls to other

861
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,639
eight the eyes so you can go out and

862
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:08,500
actually get yourself a child and I know

863
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,820
this is alarming why is this a post

864
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:11,080
request when you're pulling back an

865
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:13,330
entity this is not right

866
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:15,520
anyway also you can just change the ID

867
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:18,159
and pull back another family now that

868
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,550
there was off on this and it went like

869
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,429
this

870
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:24,970
are you authenticated yes sweet go for

871
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:26,470
it it's not like I authenticated also

872
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:27,580
are you actually trying to retrieve the

873
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:29,859
entity that you're authorized to

874
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:33,069
retrieve so that that bit was kind of

875
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:34,659
missing and for any of you that actually

876
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:36,609
tests this stuff and look for it this is

877
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:38,260
like one of the most obvious things that

878
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:40,359
you would look for one of the absolute

879
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:43,720
first things in secure direct object

880
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:46,119
references the gift that keeps giving so

881
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:48,908
you could retrieve a child you could

882
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:50,710
relocate a child and this is where it

883
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:52,480
starts to get weird because parents have

884
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:55,020
these things in order to track where the

885
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,160
children's our children's our kids are

886
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,690
so the problem there is that if you can

887
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:01,118
start to relocate the child to some

888
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:03,310
arbitrary location it kind of completely

889
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:06,190
destroys the whole premise of having the

890
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:09,220
watch in the first place so we tested it

891
00:35:06,190 --> 00:35:10,930
we sent hell off to tennis just over

892
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:13,509
here in Southport and I opened up the

893
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:15,339
app and she was that tennis and me my

894
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:18,310
helicopter parent modem are good I know

895
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:20,260
she's safe and then Kem dumped her in

896
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:22,580
the ocean

897
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:25,310
because he can do this because he can

898
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:29,000
put her wherever he wants because ken

899
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:31,759
can count got worse than that as well

900
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:35,960
and that the bit that got worse is that

901
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:37,820
these Watchers do take a 3G SIM card so

902
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,890
they can operate as a phone as well so

903
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:41,869
the parent can call the child but it

904
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:44,509
would be weird if just any person could

905
00:35:41,869 --> 00:35:46,400
call the child so there's an API that

906
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:47,690
lets you set who the parent is and by

907
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,869
now you can probably see where this is

908
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:52,340
going to be going so Ken gets hold of

909
00:35:50,869 --> 00:35:54,410
the API and he said look we're going to

910
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:58,400
make some changes we want to give you a

911
00:35:54,410 --> 00:36:00,319
call so we get out in her bed and he

912
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,900
gets one of his colleagues Vangelis he

913
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:04,790
said look Vangelis yeah obviously you

914
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:07,880
found the vulnerability in the API let's

915
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:11,140
let's see what we can do with this so

916
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:11,140
have a look at what Vangelis does

917
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:16,400
[Music]

918
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:24,749
[Music]

919
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:32,090
[Music]

920
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:42,150
and when I first saw that I was like

921
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,980
holy this is actually feels really

922
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:48,420
scary like our kyle is there videoing up

923
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:49,770
but just why is this possible and then I

924
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:52,280
remembered what ken can count and this

925
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:54,810
is what we are where we are

926
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:57,000
so these vulnerabilities keep popping up

927
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:58,470
again and again again and to their

928
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,930
credit tik-tok track did actually take

929
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:02,189
the service down very very quickly but

930
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:03,629
they had a lot of trouble actually

931
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:05,640
understanding what went wrong and

932
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:07,530
started throwing around blame and things

933
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,330
like this and this is one of the

934
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:11,130
problems we have as well there's so many

935
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:13,348
organizations out there that just aren't

936
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:16,560
equipped to deal with the data breach of

937
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:19,260
any kind who don't realize that people

938
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:20,910
like Ken Monroe is a legitimate

939
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:22,730
straightforward guy who's only there

940
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:25,109
trying to fix broken things like this

941
00:37:22,730 --> 00:37:27,240
and I thought look we should sort of end

942
00:37:25,109 --> 00:37:28,710
this on a really good example of how

943
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:32,069
companies are having trouble

944
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:35,250
communicating and I saw a recent case

945
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:38,160
involving this now this is a biometric

946
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:39,810
padlock and there's a guy called the

947
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,580
lock picking lawyer he's got a YouTube

948
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:43,650
channel where he does physical

949
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:44,910
penetration testing of padlocks it's

950
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:46,680
really fascinating actually gets big

951
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:48,240
locks and he's like you know how how can

952
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:51,299
either pick them or how much effort does

953
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,700
it take to break them so anyway he's

954
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:55,230
picked up this lock this biometric lock

955
00:37:53,700 --> 00:38:00,750
and he's going oh look at that there's a

956
00:37:55,230 --> 00:38:02,490
screw now the screw does exactly what

957
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,930
you're thinking it does right it's like

958
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:05,399
you get your screwdriver out you undo

959
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:07,109
the screw and the lock opens up that's

960
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,400
not the good bit the good bit is he's

961
00:38:07,109 --> 00:38:09,569
like okay well we got to do the right

962
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,190
thing we've got to disclose this

963
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:12,210
privately so he gets in touch with them

964
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:15,030
and says look I've got one of your looks

965
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:19,280
I have a screwdriver I managed to get in

966
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:21,450
there and they replied and they said our

967
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,280
locks are invincible to people who do

968
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:25,980
not have a screwdriver

969
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:29,270
and this is pretty much where we are

970
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:29,270
today thanks very much

971
00:38:34,869 --> 00:38:38,540
can I just ask it up fantastic

972
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:40,369
presentation one quick question before

973
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:41,810
we go cuz I judge about the Zuckerberg

974
00:38:40,369 --> 00:38:44,540
stuff but I've heard anecdotally that

975
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:45,619
the stuff that got online about the you

976
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,210
know the guys asked me how do you make

977
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:49,910
money out of it well we run ads and all

978
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:51,530
that but it in fact that I believe that

979
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:53,390
testimony kept going and there were some

980
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:55,040
senators while some quite informed

981
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:56,240
pointed questions what was your

982
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,310
experience of that did some of those

983
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,310
people they really know their stuff was

984
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:02,990
an embarrassing how far off the pace

985
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:04,730
they work and you summarize it in a

986
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:06,290
generalization or did it vary across the

987
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:08,020
people use spokes so what I actually

988
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:11,150
learned is when they ask questions

989
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:12,920
they're not their questions so they all

990
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:14,359
have liked it in fairness they're there

991
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:16,849
they are doing like testimonies on

992
00:39:14,359 --> 00:39:17,990
things like the opioid epidemic the day

993
00:39:16,849 --> 00:39:19,339
before so they're going from like

994
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:21,020
serious health care stuff to serious

995
00:39:19,339 --> 00:39:22,700
cyber stuff so they have staffers that

996
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,960
prepare all the questions and the

997
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:31,939
questions were actually pretty good I

998
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:33,230
thought so but so the questions were

999
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:35,000
reasonably point what were they trying

1000
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:36,380
to get and what do you think they came

1001
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:38,930
away with what did they come away with

1002
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:41,210
is a benefit from the testimony that you

1003
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:42,200
guys provided so the premise was what's

1004
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:43,880
the impact on knowledge based

1005
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:45,649
authentication so you know how like your

1006
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,849
bank calls up and they're like we just

1007
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:47,930
want to make sure you are who you are

1008
00:39:46,849 --> 00:39:49,099
what's your date of birth and you're

1009
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:51,379
like oh crap it's that thing that's in

1010
00:39:49,099 --> 00:39:52,910
all these data breaches they wanted to

1011
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:54,619
sort of understand how that as a means

1012
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:57,440
of authentication really doesn't work so

1013
00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:59,089
well anymore so yeah my bit was data is

1014
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,040
all over the web you really can't rely

1015
00:39:59,089 --> 00:40:03,259
on this stuff anymore and I think they

1016
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,060
got that the trick now is to see what

1017
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:07,490
actually comes as a result so this was

1018
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:09,109
about 18 months ago we did that has

1019
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:11,540
anything happened yet where are they on

1020
00:40:09,109 --> 00:40:12,680
are they moving slowly well we still got

1021
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,839
a hell of a lot of data breaches so

1022
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:16,848
hasn't changed that look I think

1023
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:17,810
organizations are moving slowly because

1024
00:40:16,849 --> 00:40:20,060
we're getting better means of

1025
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:22,070
authentication so stuff like u2f keys

1026
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:24,080
and now all over the place and lots of

1027
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:26,330
support for that so we're kind of moving

1028
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,560
in that direction but it's got to be

1029
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:29,150
slow cuz the one thing that

1030
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:31,009
knowledge-based authentication does

1031
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:32,300
really really well is everyone has

1032
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:34,280
knowledge and everyone knows how to use

1033
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:36,050
it it's it's week but the accessibility

1034
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,520
are it's off the charts give him a big

1035
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:39,260
round of applause as he walks past grabs

1036
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,619
his elder chess set on the way through

1037
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,619
as well

1038
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:45,799
get your daughter playing some Zelda

1039
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:48,500
chess thank you so much Troy what a

1040
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:50,570
fascinating just on behalf of everyone

1041
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,070
here I want to thank you for keeping us

1042
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:55,790
safe from those Russian Islamic cyber

1043
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:57,140
jihadis they are the worst our final

1044
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:58,370
presentation today again from another

1045
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:59,870
one of our platinum sponsors we could

1046
00:40:58,370 --> 00:41:01,759
not have also the way we do without the

1047
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:03,380
support of our platinum sponsors talking

1048
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,240
on threat intelligence and automating

1049
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:08,120
security processes from the good people

1050
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:09,500
at threat connect this is Director of

1051
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:10,819
Sales Engineering at threat connect

1052
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:13,420
Chris Adams give Chris a round of

1053
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:13,420
applause all yours

1054
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:24,290
thank you all right intelligence the

1055
00:41:22,130 --> 00:41:27,260
first time I really thought about the

1056
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:31,180
challenges of intelligence in a

1057
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:36,590
defensive perspective is following 9/11

1058
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:38,690
and when you think about all the

1059
00:41:36,590 --> 00:41:40,910
information that came out following the

1060
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:43,130
attacks if you're like me or all this

1061
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:46,509
information was coming in and you felt

1062
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:51,140
like how could this not be obvious right

1063
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:55,040
that's the the benefit of hindsight but

1064
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:56,600
if you really think about the the types

1065
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:59,390
of things that were going on if we think

1066
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:03,130
about the pilots for example okay three

1067
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:07,069
pilots were being trained on US soil

1068
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:09,050
both in California and in Florida you

1069
00:42:07,070 --> 00:42:11,780
had six of those pilots who were

1070
00:42:09,050 --> 00:42:15,890
frequently traveling between the United

1071
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:18,290
States and Saudi Arabia frequently four

1072
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:20,839
or some number of those were involved in

1073
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:24,740
the ham Hamburg cell in Germany so

1074
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:28,360
there's obvious link there and actually

1075
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:30,620
two of the pilots failed their training

1076
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:32,450
training for Cessnas and even though

1077
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:36,950
they had failed training they had asked

1078
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:39,049
to train on Boeing large aircraft and so

1079
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:39,950
in hindsight when all this comes out and

1080
00:42:39,050 --> 00:42:41,480
you think how could they not have

1081
00:42:39,950 --> 00:42:45,020
connected to the dots well you have to

1082
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:49,250
think that there are over 15,000

1083
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:52,130
trainings per year each all the systems

1084
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:53,560
independent right there is no one giant

1085
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:55,780
system where all that information might

1086
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,009
be stored you have hundreds of thousands

1087
00:42:55,780 --> 00:43:00,430
of people traveling back and forth

1088
00:42:57,010 --> 00:43:02,200
between the US and in places in the

1089
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:03,609
Middle East where they might be some

1090
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:05,649
cells where they were doing some type of

1091
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:07,990
activity right or communicating with

1092
00:43:05,650 --> 00:43:09,610
people who are orchestrating this so

1093
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:13,839
that's a hard problem because these are

1094
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:16,240
large disparate type systems some of the

1095
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:19,210
some of the critique of the agencies

1096
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:21,189
after the fact were you know criticisms

1097
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:24,970
on what type of processes those Intel

1098
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:26,200
agencies had were their formal process

1099
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:27,700
connecting all those things so in

1100
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,129
hindsight you'd love to see that data

1101
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:32,490
superimposed where it becomes clear but

1102
00:43:30,130 --> 00:43:37,680
there was no real process to do all that

1103
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:40,720
and so thread Intel in the cyber realm I

1104
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:43,450
as I like to think about things in that

1105
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:45,069
grant perspective obviously it's a

1106
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:47,290
different realm and cyber compared to

1107
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:49,150
the traditional defense if we think

1108
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:50,410
about what threat intelligence means in

1109
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:52,930
the cyber realm you can look at this

1110
00:43:50,410 --> 00:43:59,049
definition by Gartner kind of R or D

1111
00:43:52,930 --> 00:44:02,680
I'll let you read that real quick my

1112
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:04,000
summary definition right is knowledge of

1113
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:08,560
threats and capabilities right of

1114
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:10,450
infrastructure motive intent right so if

1115
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:13,000
that's what threat Intel is that's not

1116
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:14,770
an easy thing right that isn't it's hard

1117
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,970
understand that deep when you see the

1118
00:44:14,770 --> 00:44:17,560
types of things you're looking at day in

1119
00:44:15,970 --> 00:44:18,850
and day out how do you know what the

1120
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,600
real motives are what are the

1121
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:21,009
capabilities what are the

1122
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:23,500
infrastructures are using it takes time

1123
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:25,470
to put this picture together and so

1124
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:27,880
anyone who thinks about threat Intel and

1125
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:31,899
everyone's at varying levels of maturity

1126
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:34,390
and knowledge about it I like this this

1127
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:37,750
is a an idea that you know everyone

1128
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:40,299
belongs somewhere on this plot right far

1129
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:42,010
left interested in it don't really know

1130
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:44,260
how to engage and begin to use trying to

1131
00:44:42,010 --> 00:44:45,520
tell I won't read through all these

1132
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:47,050
things in detail for the sake of time

1133
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:50,259
but you can kind of think that you're

1134
00:44:47,050 --> 00:44:52,990
beginning to start to use it you might

1135
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:54,820
even begin to start creating it you

1136
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:57,490
might begin tying it into things that

1137
00:44:54,820 --> 00:45:00,250
you're seeing in incidents or in in your

1138
00:44:57,490 --> 00:45:03,310
sock you begin to start automating some

1139
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:05,830
processes and over time you've

1140
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:06,970
established a methodology right for

1141
00:45:05,830 --> 00:45:08,650
creating in

1142
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:10,600
chain pulling that content in and so

1143
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:13,080
without getting into too much detail to

1144
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:16,480
moving to that left side to the right

1145
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:19,870
there's I'll just talk about three key

1146
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,820
things that most organizations can just

1147
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:26,770
think about as in these are capabilities

1148
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:29,980
you want to sort of bring online so to

1149
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:32,020
start you know mention those being as we

1150
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:35,200
go through here so to start aggregating

1151
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:36,640
information aggregating phenol we got to

1152
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,740
be careful about words right it's we're

1153
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:40,420
aggregating threat data potential this

1154
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:42,279
is a lot of data you don't know if it's

1155
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:44,680
intelligence yet intelligence comes

1156
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:48,220
through a process right but one of the

1157
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:49,509
key things is establishing you know a

1158
00:45:48,220 --> 00:45:50,589
repository where you're putting

1159
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:52,210
throughout and the threat intelligence

1160
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:54,190
this is one of the first practices and

1161
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:56,320
just sure everybody in the room has some

1162
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:58,090
method and I'll argue that even if it's

1163
00:45:56,320 --> 00:46:00,910
an Excel spreadsheet that's a start

1164
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:04,660
right collecting information over time

1165
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:06,370
that you believe I have some some some

1166
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:08,230
knowledge that you want to share and

1167
00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:10,900
begin to sort of enrich and grow and

1168
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:13,840
analyze and so the key to that is having

1169
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:15,640
a data model a data model is gonna help

1170
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:18,460
you describe how where that data comes

1171
00:46:15,640 --> 00:46:22,569
and fits in and so those are indicator

1172
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:26,350
types right IP addresses addresses email

1173
00:46:22,570 --> 00:46:28,780
addresses host URLs malware events just

1174
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:31,060
a quite a bit there but in the end

1175
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:32,890
you're the the goal would be to have if

1176
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:34,299
you have multiple sources of threaten to

1177
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:38,230
tell it could be from government sources

1178
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:40,570
it could be Oh sent phishing emails you

1179
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:42,460
have laying around the the team that you

1180
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:43,750
you realize you have to aggregate and be

1181
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:46,570
able to start pulling into the process

1182
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:49,930
if once you once you begin to establish

1183
00:46:46,570 --> 00:46:52,120
a data store where you can pull that

1184
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:54,669
content in and it's sort of represented

1185
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:56,500
here with you know multiple sources when

1186
00:46:54,670 --> 00:46:58,810
you have an ability to deduplicate that

1187
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:01,300
information normalize it find

1188
00:46:58,810 --> 00:47:03,009
associations of cross that this is when

1189
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:04,390
you begin to be able to make sense out

1190
00:47:03,010 --> 00:47:08,680
of all the into all the information you

1191
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:11,200
might be pulling in okay so I like to

1192
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:13,149
say that from my experience in working

1193
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:14,919
in government you want to establish a

1194
00:47:13,150 --> 00:47:17,410
system of records system of record and

1195
00:47:14,920 --> 00:47:19,390
in traditional sense means that you're

1196
00:47:17,410 --> 00:47:21,109
building the authoritative source of

1197
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:23,870
threat Intel for your organs

1198
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:26,690
a lot of government's want to you know

1199
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:28,130
it's it's a it's a play to try to become

1200
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:30,920
the system of record and I think every

1201
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:33,260
organizations need needs one and that

1202
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:35,150
way when you have analysts come and go

1203
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:37,310
from your team you retain all that

1204
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:42,170
information and you have that to work on

1205
00:47:37,310 --> 00:47:44,890
as things go forward so that's a bit

1206
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:48,520
about aggregating threat information

1207
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:50,540
this second thing is analyzed and

1208
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:52,070
analyzing information can mean a lot of

1209
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:56,090
different things it's getting enrichment

1210
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:59,240
from other sources it's being able to

1211
00:47:56,090 --> 00:48:00,590
sort of make sense out of what that what

1212
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:03,919
type of data it is that you're looking

1213
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:07,370
at and there are a few models that I

1214
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:10,340
think should be embraced by teams to

1215
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:11,690
drive that analysis work so some one of

1216
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:13,760
the more plates straightforward

1217
00:48:11,690 --> 00:48:16,370
approaches is the diamond model for

1218
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:19,190
intrusion analysis that's the idea that

1219
00:48:16,370 --> 00:48:20,990
anything involving a threat is some type

1220
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:23,450
of activity you have a bad guy you have

1221
00:48:20,990 --> 00:48:25,040
a good guy that's being you know the

1222
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:27,680
victim in the situation you have

1223
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:30,290
infrastructure that's used to launch

1224
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:31,069
some type of capability okay that's it's

1225
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:32,660
a crime scene

1226
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:34,370
right there's always an actor there's

1227
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:36,470
always some element of that in that in

1228
00:48:34,370 --> 00:48:38,750
that scenario if you begin to think

1229
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:40,790
about things in that way then you start

1230
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:43,430
forcing your mind when you see pieces of

1231
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:44,840
information it begins to make you want

1232
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:48,049
to think how do I want to organize this

1233
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:49,640
data how do I want to structure it how

1234
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:52,250
do I want to share it with my team and

1235
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:55,069
then you get into a bit bit more insert

1236
00:48:52,250 --> 00:48:57,080
of the extent of you know deeper models

1237
00:48:55,070 --> 00:49:00,230
provided Lockheed Martin and everybody

1238
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:04,730
probably knows the kill chain miters

1239
00:49:00,230 --> 00:49:07,610
more recently popular attack these get

1240
00:49:04,730 --> 00:49:08,960
into much more granular detail and we

1241
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:11,660
see a lot of products coming online that

1242
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:15,700
begin to support those they're all good

1243
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:18,049
to me a team that establishes a

1244
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:20,000
methodology a practice is really the key

1245
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:23,300
thing get the team to speak in the same

1246
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:24,770
language right when you're that's really

1247
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:26,630
the key part is building something

1248
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:28,670
establishing something so that when new

1249
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:30,740
people come on the team there is a

1250
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:34,010
methodology approach that's a big key

1251
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:35,109
part about discovery into turning threat

1252
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:38,109
data into Intel

1253
00:49:35,109 --> 00:49:42,519
and it's establishes a proper practice

1254
00:49:38,109 --> 00:49:45,160
practices for your team and I'll just

1255
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:48,008
give a little for people who aren't

1256
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:49,180
familiar with attack it's quite complex

1257
00:49:48,009 --> 00:49:52,690
but it's kind of fun to look through

1258
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:53,979
here in fact while Troy was talking I

1259
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:55,499
was trying to think about where do some

1260
00:49:53,979 --> 00:49:58,058
of these things fit in on some of those

1261
00:49:55,499 --> 00:50:00,129
but I like to think about your you're

1262
00:49:58,059 --> 00:50:01,660
looking at you know the whys and then

1263
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:03,940
the house if I want to establish some

1264
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:05,680
persistent type of presence

1265
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:08,950
I mean Network I want to create an

1266
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:10,419
account right if I can get the crown and

1267
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:12,308
then I want to escalate my privileges I

1268
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:14,529
might use some passed the hash technique

1269
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:16,690
and start moving around somebody's

1270
00:50:14,529 --> 00:50:19,660
infrastructure right so there's always

1271
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:22,660
sort of a mindset now when you begin to

1272
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:23,890
pull information in and learn more about

1273
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:25,959
what you're saying if you begin to start

1274
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:28,150
thinking where do i classifies that by

1275
00:50:25,959 --> 00:50:29,799
this it's a lot better than just having

1276
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:31,119
a lot of data in a spreadsheet that says

1277
00:50:29,799 --> 00:50:37,329
oh I should be concerned about these

1278
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:40,209
things and and so that's a little bit

1279
00:50:37,329 --> 00:50:43,529
about aggregating content a little bit

1280
00:50:40,209 --> 00:50:45,098
about analyzing until you begin to start

1281
00:50:43,529 --> 00:50:48,459
operationalizing and that's a loaded

1282
00:50:45,099 --> 00:50:50,199
word familiar but we can think we want

1283
00:50:48,459 --> 00:50:51,459
to begin to start moving that

1284
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:53,619
intelligence around in our

1285
00:50:51,459 --> 00:50:55,899
infrastructure because until I can I can

1286
00:50:53,619 --> 00:50:57,130
have six billion indicators with someone

1287
00:50:55,900 --> 00:51:00,849
telling me that's all bad it really

1288
00:50:57,130 --> 00:51:03,249
doesn't mean anything until I find out

1289
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:07,319
that there's an indicator in some feet

1290
00:51:03,249 --> 00:51:10,299
that matches data that I have in my logs

1291
00:51:07,319 --> 00:51:12,849
all right so that's all the sudden your

1292
00:51:10,299 --> 00:51:15,190
eyes are widened and you think I got to

1293
00:51:12,849 --> 00:51:17,289
do something right because you've you

1294
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:20,469
now have some proof that that resides in

1295
00:51:17,289 --> 00:51:22,809
your network and so I believe you know

1296
00:51:20,469 --> 00:51:24,339
threat Intel is becomes that lifeblood

1297
00:51:22,809 --> 00:51:27,279
that flows through the environment where

1298
00:51:24,339 --> 00:51:29,229
it's really a feedback loop between your

1299
00:51:27,279 --> 00:51:30,969
infrastructure and what it is you've

1300
00:51:29,229 --> 00:51:32,948
learned and what is you've pulled in and

1301
00:51:30,969 --> 00:51:33,579
that's not just from a system

1302
00:51:32,949 --> 00:51:35,709
perspective

1303
00:51:33,579 --> 00:51:37,089
I mean sometimes the fun part the

1304
00:51:35,709 --> 00:51:38,640
integrations and seeing how you can pull

1305
00:51:37,089 --> 00:51:41,619
things and get products to work together

1306
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:44,670
but it's also people its people from I

1307
00:51:41,619 --> 00:51:47,069
are seeing something sharing that

1308
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:48,890
collaborating within an environment

1309
00:51:47,069 --> 00:51:50,660
becomes a very important

1310
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:54,310
part of that what we call dissemination

1311
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:54,310
within our in within the organization

1312
00:51:57,790 --> 00:52:03,490
and so I'm gonna when you begin to start

1313
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:06,350
you know systems can permit that type of

1314
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:10,310
integrations right just from I'd say

1315
00:52:06,350 --> 00:52:13,460
some from central store via api's you

1316
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:16,220
have this a new word that's making its

1317
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:18,410
way sore right this is security

1318
00:52:16,220 --> 00:52:21,259
orchestration being able to automate

1319
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:22,970
some type of response to that there's a

1320
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:26,600
pretty graphic from Gartner making this

1321
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:28,790
official technology and you have a

1322
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:31,730
really a kind of a healthy cycle here of

1323
00:52:28,790 --> 00:52:34,250
detect triage respond responded

1324
00:52:31,730 --> 00:52:35,240
prioritize there's some value in this

1325
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:37,010
and I thinking this is like a

1326
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,930
traditional really cycle for analysis

1327
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:41,690
right and things you want to do and

1328
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:44,180
being able to orchestrate processes I'm

1329
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:45,500
an IT guy I love tech right but I don't

1330
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:48,710
believe you can just automate your way

1331
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:50,660
out of out of problems I think what you

1332
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:52,850
do is find ways to optimize what the

1333
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:54,890
team is doing I'll show some examples of

1334
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:58,370
this in a minute but orchestration is

1335
00:52:54,890 --> 00:53:00,529
really just the concept that a team you

1336
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:02,420
know security is maturing right there

1337
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:04,610
should be established processes some of

1338
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:07,100
that of which you can automate some that

1339
00:53:04,610 --> 00:53:09,080
you're not you don't need to we're not

1340
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:11,540
trying to turn security into something

1341
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:13,549
that's you know built just be

1342
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:16,040
self-healing there are reason for

1343
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:18,590
analysts what's or does promise and the

1344
00:53:16,040 --> 00:53:20,930
automation the part of things is to give

1345
00:53:18,590 --> 00:53:23,150
your analyst more time to really focus

1346
00:53:20,930 --> 00:53:25,310
on the analysis part and relieve some

1347
00:53:23,150 --> 00:53:29,750
time from the things of the the things

1348
00:53:25,310 --> 00:53:32,509
that can be automated and so I'd like to

1349
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:34,100
thank you know as a tech person right

1350
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:36,020
this isn't I say down to the bottom

1351
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:39,560
right this is nothing new it's not new

1352
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:42,550
in the sense that in IT in general

1353
00:53:39,560 --> 00:53:46,759
there's been automation forever right

1354
00:53:42,550 --> 00:53:48,800
people are old as I back in the you know

1355
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:50,990
days when Enterprise Service bus Azure

1356
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:55,100
the rage and for the IT stack right

1357
00:53:50,990 --> 00:53:57,200
Message Queuing Web Services these are

1358
00:53:55,100 --> 00:54:00,140
technologies that will lets if we call

1359
00:53:57,200 --> 00:54:03,020
security a department in an organization

1360
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:05,900
like finite like finance

1361
00:54:03,020 --> 00:54:08,119
Logistics operations all the different

1362
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:11,480
departments you have they have grown up

1363
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:13,970
stacks of products security is just

1364
00:54:11,480 --> 00:54:16,280
seems to be this like let the the last

1365
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:18,319
to become an official department that

1366
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:20,180
deserves technologies the tie systems

1367
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:22,520
together many times

1368
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:25,250
security stacks you know they're grown

1369
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:27,290
organically no one no one typically

1370
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:29,359
people don't define an enterprise

1371
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:31,849
architecture and then start filling

1372
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:35,210
things in right departments they get a

1373
00:54:31,849 --> 00:54:36,619
firewall they get an IDs proxy right

1374
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:38,089
everyone knows how things grow in

1375
00:54:36,619 --> 00:54:39,319
Greenwich and then the fight is how do

1376
00:54:38,089 --> 00:54:43,279
you get these things to talk to each

1377
00:54:39,319 --> 00:54:45,770
other and so sore is that realization

1378
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,329
that it's maturities cut that you know

1379
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:49,250
security is now becoming a first-class

1380
00:54:47,329 --> 00:54:51,710
citizen that's in the end it is just

1381
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:53,000
data right and having an approach to

1382
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:55,910
managing that data is what we're looking

1383
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:59,990
for so let's just look at a couple

1384
00:54:55,910 --> 00:55:01,940
examples of what I think are some of the

1385
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:05,149
key examples for people just to think

1386
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:08,869
about from a malware analysis

1387
00:55:05,150 --> 00:55:12,260
perspective in this case take malware

1388
00:55:08,869 --> 00:55:15,290
file be loaded into your tip there's

1389
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:18,200
some context of where it came from files

1390
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:21,190
then sent to an AMA tool you parse the

1391
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:23,299
results of that and then maybe present

1392
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:25,420
some of that information you came back

1393
00:55:23,299 --> 00:55:28,250
from that report so in that case perhaps

1394
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:30,290
some iOS sees that came out of what that

1395
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:32,599
malware did are collected they're pulled

1396
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:35,720
back into your tip perhaps speeds that

1397
00:55:32,599 --> 00:55:38,000
you that you have pulled into your into

1398
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:39,290
a central store now give us some context

1399
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:41,839
of what that is and if you could then

1400
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:43,308
search a sim or search something and you

1401
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:45,680
can see if that had some effect on you

1402
00:55:43,309 --> 00:55:47,299
so this is something maybe you know a

1403
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:49,040
lot of analysts will do everyday if you

1404
00:55:47,299 --> 00:55:50,900
can automate that so that you're just

1405
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,790
seeing the results of anything you sent

1406
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:55,430
that you're saving a lot of time and

1407
00:55:52,790 --> 00:55:56,960
value ever over a period of time for a

1408
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:59,240
little bit more sophisticated type of

1409
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:01,010
example this is something we had built

1410
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:04,009
just a designer from a customer's

1411
00:56:01,010 --> 00:56:05,720
perspective is what if I take you fish

1412
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:07,190
right everybody how could something how

1413
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:10,279
many phishing emails do people get

1414
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:11,720
inundated with every week if I can

1415
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:14,510
automate a process where I'm sending

1416
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:16,069
every fish to an environment we're

1417
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:19,459
parsing taking off

1418
00:56:16,069 --> 00:56:21,079
petter body attachments we're running

1419
00:56:19,459 --> 00:56:23,839
all those through enrichment sources in

1420
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:27,170
this case we're looking you know taking

1421
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:30,949
something and detonating malware in a

1422
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:33,559
malware analysis platform taking that

1423
00:56:30,949 --> 00:56:35,690
information back and it like I mentioned

1424
00:56:33,559 --> 00:56:38,749
earlier a few parts and then can search

1425
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:41,059
your sim and find out have any of those

1426
00:56:38,749 --> 00:56:43,009
indicators a bit in my environment well

1427
00:56:41,059 --> 00:56:47,839
maybe then my result is I create a

1428
00:56:43,009 --> 00:56:51,289
ticket or maybe I lock the ad account of

1429
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:53,089
that user just to prevent them and say

1430
00:56:51,289 --> 00:56:55,819
send them a note slack message that they

1431
00:56:53,089 --> 00:56:58,609
have to talk to IT before they can log

1432
00:56:55,819 --> 00:57:01,729
into their account again alright so a

1433
00:56:58,609 --> 00:57:04,098
little bit sophisticated use case the

1434
00:57:01,729 --> 00:57:05,058
key is that this is all possible these

1435
00:57:04,099 --> 00:57:06,859
are things that you can do you can

1436
00:57:05,059 --> 00:57:09,289
modify those flows to your heart's

1437
00:57:06,859 --> 00:57:11,180
content you can introduce a person in

1438
00:57:09,289 --> 00:57:12,109
the loop and say before I take this step

1439
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:14,118
I actually want to be able to make a

1440
00:57:12,109 --> 00:57:16,819
decision here I don't want something to

1441
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:18,289
follow all through this right and so the

1442
00:57:16,819 --> 00:57:20,089
key thing to take away with this is that

1443
00:57:18,289 --> 00:57:22,940
with the advent of automation in this

1444
00:57:20,089 --> 00:57:24,229
sense it's and I consider this where we

1445
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:27,229
were talked about that maturity curve

1446
00:57:24,229 --> 00:57:29,390
kind of here then at far right where

1447
00:57:27,229 --> 00:57:31,279
we're trying to identify the things that

1448
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:34,160
art seemed to waste a lot of our time

1449
00:57:31,279 --> 00:57:36,829
and I think I've seen in terms of

1450
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:38,839
benefiting one-man teams or one-person

1451
00:57:36,829 --> 00:57:40,670
teams who are running security up to

1452
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:42,140
having teams of 60 people there's always

1453
00:57:40,670 --> 00:57:44,059
a means for being able automate and

1454
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:48,019
that's part of what I understand to be

1455
00:57:44,059 --> 00:57:50,059
very beneficial for organizations it's

1456
00:57:48,019 --> 00:57:51,558
so cost when I have to just mention this

1457
00:57:50,059 --> 00:57:53,869
real quick

1458
00:57:51,559 --> 00:57:56,239
part of what you want to try to achieve

1459
00:57:53,869 --> 00:57:58,369
in turning like return on investment

1460
00:57:56,239 --> 00:58:01,339
right what is all what does automation

1461
00:57:58,369 --> 00:58:04,969
offer well you can calculate the amount

1462
00:58:01,339 --> 00:58:07,369
of time it takes to do certain things if

1463
00:58:04,969 --> 00:58:10,009
