andrew is a systems engineer at Illumina

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,160
he has over 15 years of experience in

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,230
security and quality assurance working

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,929
with organizations across Asia Pacific

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,820
to strengthen their cyber resilience

6
00:00:11,929 --> 00:00:16,890
having worked with major industry

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,189
players like micro focused and HPE

8
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:22,529
andrew has now represents Illumina South

9
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:25,050
Pacific as he marries his knowledge of

10
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:26,730
technology and industry to deep and and

11
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,410
implement solutions that prevent

12
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,490
attackers lateral movement throughout

13
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:31,230
the organization

14
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:36,930
can you please join me in welcoming

15
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:37,890
Andrew thank you very much person thanks

16
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:40,110
everybody for joining the tool this

17
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,670
afternoon I really appreciate it I think

18
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,350
as we get into this topic and hopefully

19
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,820
actually zero Trust is becoming a bit

20
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,899
more of a buzzword so you've either kind

21
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,370
of latched on to that and you kind of

22
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:48,719
know what I'm going to talk about or

23
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,370
maybe just that the enticement of

24
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,649
marginalizing the breach will get you

25
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,449
through this particular talk and I think

26
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:56,399
before we kind of get cracking on to

27
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:57,480
what I actually mean around that I think

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,309
one of the key things that we've found

29
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,019
in in a security world is we've we've

30
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:03,718
been very focused over a number of years

31
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,790
around preventing attackers from getting

32
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:07,619
into an organization or trying to be

33
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:10,799
much better at identifying when they're

34
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:12,570
in with analytics and heuristics and

35
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,010
machine learning and trying to react to

36
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,189
that problem of what do we do once

37
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,110
they're inside and it's been my pleasure

38
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,059
and I was very lucky to join the loomio

39
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,200
recently here in Australia about 18

40
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,460
months ago and they're kind of looking

41
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,490
at the problem from a slightly different

42
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,439
angle of not of assuming that breach is

43
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,350
going to occur but actually taking

44
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,539
proactive measures to limit the blast

45
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,220
radius or the exposure of their breach

46
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:36,840
and that's kind of where that the

47
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,670
beginning is of zero trust comes into

48
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,689
life as well as the assumed breach

49
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,590
mentality and planned beyond the breach

50
00:01:41,689 --> 00:01:45,298
and you might be wondering well why

51
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,399
would I be interested in this or why

52
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:48,689
would I be why would it be required to

53
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:50,520
think about it in this particular way

54
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:51,809
and if what I've got kind of up here on

55
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,280
the slide and hopefully the guys at the

56
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:54,540
back and see this I've got a few that

57
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,049
might get a little bit smaller so I'll

58
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,390
try my best to talk them through but

59
00:01:57,049 --> 00:02:02,390
industry regulation kind of compliance

60
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:04,799
and internal drivers are all starting to

61
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:07,049
you know to come along with this journey

62
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,899
with our InfoSec professionals around a

63
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:10,560
need to be able to can be more proactive

64
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,950
in terms

65
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,950
of identifying what some call crown

66
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:19,290
jewel applications or at least systems

67
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:22,019
or software that manages data that is

68
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:23,099
sensitive and is particularly important

69
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,870
not only to the business but the

70
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:28,260
consumers or the the trust that you're

71
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:30,599
building with your particular customer

72
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,849
base and whether that be a particular

73
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,649
industry like financials opera you know

74
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:35,819
PCI is Swift and other regulations have

75
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,920
been around for a little while

76
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:39,569
whether it be government and and I come

77
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,280
from Sydney so kind of a New South Wales

78
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:43,530
government initiatives are starting to

79
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,230
take place of not only identifying those

80
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:47,910
systems but then having controls that

81
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,040
are commensurate with the risk that they

82
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,569
pose and being able to kind of prove

83
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,950
that we are we're doing the right things

84
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:55,849
and approaching this problem in the

85
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:58,079
right way and whether that be you know

86
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:59,970
financial information health information

87
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,890
personal information I mean we don't

88
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,840
need to talk about what constitutes

89
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,450
sensitive data in this particular

90
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,280
audience but we we generally all have

91
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:11,790
software or applications we have IT

92
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:13,140
departments data centers public cloud

93
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:16,230
that is operating on this type of

94
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:17,339
information and the idea is that

95
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,780
hopefully we can take a little bit more

96
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,400
of a proactive approach to protecting

97
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,390
some of them now it's that's a little

98
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,790
bit about what we're going to talk about

99
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:26,910
today and introduce that kind of concept

100
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:29,578
of zero trust into the mix there and how

101
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,750
that kind of plays in the other kind of

102
00:03:29,579 --> 00:03:32,730
intro that I would kind of mention

103
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:34,049
around this and comes back a little bit

104
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,030
to the way that a loomio looks at the

105
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:38,100
world and how customers of Illumina are

106
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,530
kind of approaching this problem is that

107
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:43,319
if we have kind of an understanding

108
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:44,970
about our existing known risk or and at

109
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:47,488
least an appreciation of what a risk

110
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,750
might might contain or what that might

111
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:51,180
mean as an impact of the business

112
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:53,459
there's kind of two factors to that risk

113
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:55,470
and one is the exploitability factor or

114
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,450
how how easy it would it be for someone

115
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:00,090
to actually achieve a breach of that

116
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:02,420
mechanism on the other factor is really

117
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,980
kind of the likelihood of it happening

118
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:06,030
and and when we look at classic kind of

119
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,280
risk graphs that's what kind of you're

120
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,799
plotting on an x and y axis and and from

121
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,880
our perspective and the customers that

122
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,549
we have they kind of look at that

123
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:15,690
likelihood of that reach ability is one

124
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:17,880
of the factors that you can actually

125
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:20,640
have a lot more influence over or even

126
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:22,289
control to a much greater degree you

127
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,370
know the ability for someone to come up

128
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:25,110
with a hack that

129
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:26,880
breach you in a way it's a little bit

130
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:29,250
less out of your control but certainly

131
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,130
the ability to you know to limit the

132
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:34,290
possibility of someone reaching a system

133
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:36,719
that they shouldn't be able to access is

134
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:38,520
something that we can control and if we

135
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,949
look at the hacking playfield one of the

136
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,900
things that we have as an advantage is

137
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:43,949
that we should know our environment and

138
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,770
be able to control our environment

139
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:48,389
better than someone that's looking from

140
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:50,159
the outside is attempting to break in

141
00:04:48,389 --> 00:04:52,080
okay so think of it that way you know

142
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,699
likelihood or the reach ability factor

143
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,169
is something in our control and that's

144
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:57,030
what we're going to talk about as we go

145
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:59,039
through this and think about that zero

146
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:01,469
trust method and it kind of hops back I

147
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:03,539
mean whether it's an attack or a mitre

148
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,669
or a kind of an adversary lifecycle

149
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:06,810
attack lifecycle of going up here one of

150
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:08,580
the key elements and I'm going to kind

151
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:09,930
of avoid all the bit at the front which

152
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,979
is the interest it's interesting stuff

153
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,560
about how they're actually going to

154
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:16,139
achieve breaching an organization but

155
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,199
our particular focus is generally around

156
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:21,180
how do they actually managed to reach

157
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,639
the systems that hold that sensitive

158
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:25,320
data and and the typical breach patterns

159
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:28,260
you will read about hopefully you're not

160
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:31,740
participating in they all reflect that a

161
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:33,630
low value low risk system maybe even one

162
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:37,950
external to your business is the point

163
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:40,050
of compromise but from there they have

164
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:42,030
the ability to either live long in that

165
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:43,770
kind of persistent threat model but

166
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:46,469
certainly have an opportunity to then

167
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:48,030
move within that environment to get from

168
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:50,070
that low risk system they're easy to

169
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,900
compromise system into those systems

170
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:54,150
that hold that sensitive data so that

171
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:57,030
lateral movement that opportunity for

172
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:58,500
walking through a data center now that

173
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,780
they have breached is something that

174
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,250
occurs pretty much in most breach

175
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,198
notifications that you'll read in the

176
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:06,090
news and again it comes back to that

177
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,500
fact that with the concentrating on

178
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:09,719
trying to plug all the holes and keep

179
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,430
everybody out we tend not to have a lot

180
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:15,210
of control once someone manages to

181
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:17,280
breach their perimeter and zero trust is

182
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,739
very much that concept of rethinking

183
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,570
that kind of turning that on its head

184
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,680
and trying to identify and prevent that

185
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:26,039
level of movement from happening in the

186
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,020
first place so this is yeah that's going

187
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,880
on so underpinning a lot of this talk

188
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,400
that I'm going to do today is this

189
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,630
concept of micro segmentation or

190
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,400
segmentation that you'll see come

191
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,870
through this talk and just to kind of

192
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,729
give you an idea how that went

193
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:40,830
passed quite quickly but a blink if you

194
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:42,600
missed it but but fundamentally if we

195
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,250
think of an analogy around what

196
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,890
segmentation means there's nothing kind

197
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:48,390
of new in terms of our psyche if we

198
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:49,860
built a submarine that was on the first

199
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,280
page there on earth on the left-hand

200
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,840
side

201
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,539
they kind of represented that open

202
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:56,520
system open hole or any sort of ship any

203
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:58,020
sort of breach any tiny print rig of

204
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,450
water is eventually going to bring down

205
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,820
the whole system that kind of mentality

206
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:05,729
of having a really high pressured hole

207
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:07,080
or a strong perimeter defense doesn't

208
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:09,030
mean anything once it's breached because

209
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,740
down it goes whereas on the right-hand

210
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:12,450
side which is actually the way they

211
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,890
build submarines don't worry for anyone

212
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:16,260
that is a Submariner wants to join the

213
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,820
Navy they actually build submarines in

214
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:21,450
this way with lots and lots of bulkheads

215
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:23,700
or compartments or segments which

216
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:26,130
fundamentally means they're expecting a

217
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:27,900
breach to occur right so they're

218
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:30,540
assuming breach they're planning ahead

219
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,370
of breach but making sure that when that

220
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:35,630
little breach occurs and no matter how

221
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:38,400
big it is that it's compartmentalized

222
00:07:35,630 --> 00:07:39,659
restricted or segmented so that doesn't

223
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,859
bring the whole thing down you can't get

224
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:42,330
everywhere within the sub just because

225
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,790
you managed to breach that hole

226
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:46,770
ok so that'sthat's the concept of micro

227
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:48,660
segmentation it's gonna behind the

228
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:52,229
perimeter behind the Gateway how can we

229
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,910
ensure that someone can't move or get

230
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:55,590
access to everything once they're inside

231
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:58,170
by building these little micro

232
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:59,789
perimeters or compartments okay and

233
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:01,410
that's the end of my naval analogies

234
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:04,080
I've got a couple of road-based ones

235
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:05,730
coming up soon so the key thing there

236
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,349
yet it said probably inevitable that

237
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:08,850
we're going to be breached but we don't

238
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,700
have to go down with the ship if that is

239
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:13,290
the case so we're bringing that kind of

240
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,180
analogy back from naval back to kind of

241
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:16,320
IT and departments I mean this is

242
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,910
probably not a great diagram that

243
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:19,590
describes all of your environments but

244
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:21,930
it's reasonably traditional in the sense

245
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:24,270
that we've placed those controls around

246
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:25,950
perimeters we're probably building some

247
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,810
level of kind of zoning within our data

248
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:30,840
center you know the old classic a dmz s

249
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:32,340
and trusted zones and probably using

250
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,069
kind of traditional firewalling

251
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:37,740
mechanisms and switching technology to

252
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:40,020
kind of group systems together that

253
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:43,289
might reflect maybe their classification

254
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:45,870
of data and this was kind of appropriate

255
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:47,670
in the 90s and then we kind of

256
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,230
virtualized stuff so uses o for those

257
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,640
that can't see we kind of chuck in a

258
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:53,340
virtualization platform until

259
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,290
their data center environment and it

260
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:58,050
kind of spans all of that and and then

261
00:08:55,290 --> 00:09:00,209
more of lately perhaps moving up to a

262
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:02,729
hybrid model around the cloud multi

263
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:04,920
cloud coming into the play of that what

264
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,270
tends to happen is that if you manage to

265
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,490
breach one of those zones you've

266
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:11,250
probably got free reign within that zone

267
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:15,540
it's probably not that hard to then swap

268
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:17,070
the Traverse zones because typically we

269
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:18,780
start opening up a whole bunch of holes

270
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:20,100
between things of exceptions and just to

271
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:21,480
make things work we've got to get things

272
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,890
working for the app teams and the dev

273
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,990
ops teams who have to run faster and

274
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:26,760
faster so we probably tend to start to

275
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:28,440
see a bit more of a porous environment

276
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,300
where the firewalls aren't really doing

277
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,440
what we think they were doing and then

278
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,969
we have to worry about what we do in the

279
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,070
cloud and how that works and do we have

280
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:37,350
kind of a different security posture

281
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:38,520
completely in in a public cloud

282
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,070
environment than we would have had

283
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,750
on-premise and and a desire in a lot of

284
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:44,130
cases to go to the cloud cloud first

285
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:47,100
strategies and so forth and how are we

286
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:49,170
going to maintain that so typically this

287
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:51,210
model doesn't really achieve what we're

288
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:53,790
looking for if we're looking to isolate

289
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:55,620
systems and protect that data and this

290
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:57,390
is obviously what happens in the

291
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,740
breaches today most are operating in

292
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:01,920
some form of model that looks a little

293
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:03,300
bit like this and the idea and I

294
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,099
apologize because you won't get to see

295
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:07,229
this at the back for sure but the idea

296
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,330
would be to build those compartments

297
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,190
within each of those zones or or maybe

298
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:13,680
even kind of phase away that idea of

299
00:10:11,190 --> 00:10:15,810
these big trusted zones and adopt more

300
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,270
of an approach which is the zero trust

301
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:19,650
model of don't trust anything by default

302
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:22,350
just because you happen to be in a

303
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:25,260
particular part of the data center all

304
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:26,720
right so each application or potentially

305
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:30,210
each group of systems or maybe even

306
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,120
every VM that you run should be able to

307
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:35,040
have some concept of what am I allowed

308
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:37,620
to talk to and I should only talk to

309
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:39,240
others in that way and just because I

310
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,920
happen to be in a VLAN does not mean I

311
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,950
should be able to contact everything on

312
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:46,199
that VLAN okay so building segments is

313
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:47,550
that way of reducing the attack surface

314
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,020
because it means that if attacker does

315
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,490
manage to breach some part they can't

316
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:53,250
get out of that compartment that they're

317
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:54,600
in the submarine still holds and they

318
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:57,390
can't get themselves throughout the rest

319
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,300
of it but the challenge is how do we go

320
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:02,819
about achieving kind of bringing these

321
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:04,170
perimeters closer and closer to each

322
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,149
application or

323
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:08,519
closer and closer to every compute that

324
00:11:06,149 --> 00:11:09,930
we have and particularly when we start

325
00:11:08,519 --> 00:11:11,010
thinking about cloud where we don't over

326
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,599
the infrastructure we don't own the

327
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:14,850
network how can we achieve kind of this

328
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,589
network centric security model of

329
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,279
segmentation if we don't actually own

330
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:18,899
the network

331
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,850
or be able to interact well with the

332
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:24,060
network at all so this proposes a real

333
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:25,560
challenge to us so yeah zero trust just

334
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,329
actually by a show of hands is it is it

335
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:30,239
is everybody heard of the term zero

336
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:31,649
trust I call everybody so everybody

337
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,889
knows what the definition kind of is

338
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:36,300
right you don't you don't implicitly you

339
00:11:34,889 --> 00:11:38,100
know trust anything around you or

340
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,810
develop a policy that would mean that

341
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,089
you are implicitly allowed to do

342
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:43,529
something objects in the network should

343
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:45,899
be no more trustworthy than anything

344
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:47,220
outside the network and the idea is to

345
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:49,589
kind of bring down these micro

346
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,510
perimeters and forest those is obviously

347
00:11:49,589 --> 00:11:53,430
an analyst group that's been pretty

348
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,660
heavy on this chase Cunningham if you if

349
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,859
you're not already familiar it's done a

350
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:59,730
lot of work in this area in terms of

351
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:02,160
describing a zero trust framework which

352
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:05,699
looks to identify how we can protect

353
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,569
data and systems and people in a fashion

354
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:11,010
that is orchestrated all or automated

355
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:12,300
okay it's a keep up with the business

356
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,800
that we're running but if then

357
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,329
fundamentally they realize or they

358
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,130
reckon from every particular research

359
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:19,170
that they can reduce a lot of your

360
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:21,360
exposure and risk which is obviously a

361
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:23,459
key goal of any security type program

362
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,870
but you can also reduce the cost

363
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:27,540
associated with running what you're

364
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:29,070
doing today and achieving an even better

365
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,630
goal than you have in terms of the

366
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:34,230
granularity of control that you can have

367
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:36,060
over these systems so so that's a cool

368
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:37,290
thing is for those that most of people

369
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,359
said they'd kind of realize they're at

370
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:41,519
rest there's a second show of hands is

371
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,829
anybody kind of running an entire zero

372
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,449
trust framework already or on the

373
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:48,510
journey towards I think significantly

374
00:12:45,449 --> 00:12:49,620
enough on the journey towards a couple

375
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,569
of hands so they're probably a lot of

376
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:52,980
opportunity perhaps to to really key

377
00:12:51,569 --> 00:12:55,709
into that and see how that would kind of

378
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,510
work for your organization all right so

379
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:59,609
I'm going to kind of bring this zero

380
00:12:57,510 --> 00:13:01,250
trust model back into that concept of

381
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:03,959
building segments and compartments

382
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:06,180
because ultimately that kind of really

383
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:08,760
fits the bill of zero trust no implicit

384
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:11,430
allows denied by default lock everything

385
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,810
down into small micro perimeters we can

386
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:15,630
achieve that hopefully we can achieve

387
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:16,619
that across our you know modern data

388
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:18,330
centers today

389
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:20,040
so how would we have done that or how

390
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,650
could we approach this problem if we

391
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,520
were looking to try and reduce

392
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:25,680
connectivity between all these systems

393
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:28,260
only down to what is required for an

394
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,060
application to function how could we

395
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:32,670
kind of do that and one of the first

396
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:35,729
things that a lot of loomio customers

397
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:39,449
actually try and do is bring that

398
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:41,820
network construct still sink that deeper

399
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:45,360
and deeper into the data center applying

400
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:47,850
kind of switching level ACLs or dropping

401
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,590
firewalls or bringing more and Drink

402
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:51,630
dragging those firewalls closer and

403
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:53,640
closer into the data center to try and

404
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,230
attempt a mechanism of

405
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,550
compartmentalizing and fire warning off

406
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,440
because that's the way that we've done

407
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:00,120
it and our perimeters are kind of based

408
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,520
on that approach as well but that's

409
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,260
particularly challenging to do it's it's

410
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,329
costly as well as challenging in terms

411
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:08,280
of the management and the overhead in

412
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:09,900
the the ownerís nature of managing all

413
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,400
of these more firewalls inside your

414
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,689
particular data center and of course

415
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,180
then what do you do when you're talking

416
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:16,980
about the cloud and and and how would we

417
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:20,670
run firewalling in environments that we

418
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:22,920
don't really control on the flip side a

419
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,719
lot of organizations may have a lot of

420
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:26,370
these types of technologies already so

421
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,960
one other answer might be well I'm

422
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:30,180
running kind of an Sdn environment so

423
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:32,790
can I just you know automate or

424
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:35,040
computerize the development of policy

425
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:36,810
and utilize exactly what I've got and

426
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,630
maybe that will be my solution to the

427
00:14:36,810 --> 00:14:41,280
management overhead of those things but

428
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:45,030
again typically what we find is that

429
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:47,280
that that detachment of kind of the

430
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:49,530
business context or the understanding of

431
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,689
the application layer back to say the IP

432
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:53,970
addressing of what all of these systems

433
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:55,710
are based on kind of any sort of

434
00:14:53,970 --> 00:14:57,930
mismatch between IP addresses and

435
00:14:55,710 --> 00:15:00,630
systems and understanding causes a lot

436
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:03,300
of problems in that space a lot of the

437
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:05,520
time applications don't nicely reside on

438
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:06,990
kind of these network boundaries that

439
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,460
would make it really easy for any of

440
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:11,060
these solutions to kind of carve off

441
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:15,390
segments of networks that effectively

442
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:16,709
and so although they sound attractive it

443
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:19,530
generally doesn't actually end up

444
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:21,600
working that well and what we would

445
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:24,689
probably like to see though is to to

446
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:27,060
kind of if you like separate kind of the

447
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:28,950
operation of our network from the kind

448
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,300
of security goals that we have for the

449
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:33,420
network

450
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:35,880
as if we can maybe do that we can get

451
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:37,979
away from kind of compromising our

452
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,650
network design to try and get security

453
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:42,000
happy and you all the security guys so

454
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,800
we always want you guys to be happy as

455
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,120
well of course but but it's never going

456
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,130
to work if we can't get both sides kind

457
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,110
of playing nicely and so yeah that the

458
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:50,450
typical the impact that we see from from

459
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:52,530
this approach and whether it's a

460
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,970
switching approach or a fire warming

461
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:56,160
approach or whether it's trying to adopt

462
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:59,490
the technology you have today in a

463
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:02,370
network centric approach is generally

464
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:04,350
that you increase the possibility that

465
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:06,540
applications or the availability z/os

466
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:08,310
apps will fail or reduce because you

467
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:10,410
probably break something as this is all

468
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:11,910
happening and generally the worst thing

469
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:14,520
from a security perspective is to break

470
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:15,930
the availability of an application and

471
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:17,430
no one trusts you after that let alone

472
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:21,060
the phone calls that you get all the

473
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:23,550
time even if you are kind of operating

474
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:26,010
an SDN style or a an orchestrated

475
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:28,229
environment the operational overhead of

476
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:30,060
managing that tends to mean that you are

477
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:32,070
in a situation where the network is

478
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:34,260
generally more fragile because of that

479
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:35,700
nature and the changes that you're

480
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,720
looking to make and their reluctance to

481
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:38,610
kind of change things that are working

482
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,890
I've seen some great environments where

483
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:42,660
app team owners know exactly where they

484
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:44,280
want to request their infrastructure to

485
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:46,350
be placed because that's where it worked

486
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,730
for them last time if it works for me

487
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,410
there I'll put my next app there

488
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:51,420
regardless of whether or not it's shares

489
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:52,770
the same kind of risk profile because I

490
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,170
know that I can get connectivity if I

491
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:56,699
put it over there and that's kind of it

492
00:16:55,170 --> 00:16:58,170
ends up kind of either reducing the

493
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,640
attacks we're sorry increasing the

494
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:00,719
attack servers or it's certainly

495
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:03,720
increasing the fragility of the

496
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,220
environment you have and often an

497
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:08,280
underpinning all of this is that kind of

498
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:09,480
lack of agility and again a customers

499
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,310
that we've talked to and a lot of people

500
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,230
we talk to to keep up with the business

501
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:16,560
week we can't afford to wait two weeks

502
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:18,390
for the next firewall burn that maybe

503
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,560
gets fat-fingered or misunderstood and

504
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:21,060
it goes wrong and then you wait two

505
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:22,470
weeks again for the next opportunity on

506
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:24,690
a Thursday afternoon for the next file

507
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:26,850
will change to happen although the

508
00:17:24,690 --> 00:17:28,230
request for infrastructure takes longer

509
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:30,770
than you can do with a credit card in

510
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:33,270
Amazon and that just leads to shadow IT

511
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:35,879
so all of those things tend to kind of

512
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:38,040
fall a little bit short and you might be

513
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,030
thinking well well what on earth are we

514
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,250
going to do then if we're talking about

515
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:42,450
a network centric approach and their

516
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,360
traditional approaches that we have

517
00:17:42,450 --> 00:17:44,740
aren't really working

518
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:48,899
and how are we kind of how are we going

519
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:51,279
to go about solving this problem and

520
00:17:48,899 --> 00:17:53,860
it's kind of a kind of things is my

521
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:55,570
second analogy I apologize the the the

522
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:57,129
picture on the right isn't a Gold Coast

523
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,899
or a Brisbane highway because I don't

524
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,640
think we do this anymore but if you kind

525
00:17:58,899 --> 00:18:03,158
of think of it as then the network teams

526
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,950
and the idea is that we want to have

527
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:07,690
highly performing highly connected

528
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:09,789
highly available really fast highways

529
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:11,440
and open connections because that gives

530
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:13,330
us that you know the best opportunity

531
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,639
from a networking perspective but then

532
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:17,620
we've got that kind of compromise or

533
00:18:15,639 --> 00:18:19,389
opposing thought from the security angle

534
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:21,699
which is well if we're going to control

535
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:24,010
everything and our way of doing that is

536
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:27,100
by placing kind of network centric

537
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:28,840
controls in this case kind of a physical

538
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,279
control like a physical firewall control

539
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,199
then we're immediately kind of

540
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:34,029
compromising and traffic steering and

541
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:37,330
and and and really compromising that

542
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:39,460
position and luckily in the road network

543
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:41,620
we kind of don't do this anymore

544
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:43,299
and I'm not really that old enough to

545
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,370
think about it but but generally we do

546
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:46,840
we in Australia at least and although

547
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:48,239
Sydney's getting more and more toll

548
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,490
roads which is not what we want but

549
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,370
generally we've now realized that the

550
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:56,740
better way to do tolling on a highway is

551
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:59,289
to actually place a transceiver in every

552
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:03,029
car and then we just simply

553
00:18:59,289 --> 00:19:05,590
electronically retrieve fees by

554
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:09,279
recognising when that vehicle crosses

555
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:11,709
boundaries and that's I know the

556
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:14,590
analogies you'll see I think coming up

557
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:17,769
shortly but taking away from a physical

558
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:20,320
cash base control on the network or on

559
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:23,320
the highway and placing it as a

560
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,629
responsibility or a transponder in each

561
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:28,600
vehicle or in each server or in each

562
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:30,669
workload that we are then applying that

563
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,199
control to now in this case it's taking

564
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,960
money from you for driving on the road

565
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:36,190
but it could equally be or perhaps it

566
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,600
would be a strange Tollbooth that would

567
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:39,820
prevent you from actually reaching the

568
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,769
road but in our case for security it

569
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:42,939
could be a policy that would restrict

570
00:19:41,769 --> 00:19:44,980
you from being able to access that

571
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:48,010
particular highway or that communication

572
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:51,630
flow and if we start thinking about it

573
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:55,000
that way we're actually decoupling the

574
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:57,639
control from the fabric of our network

575
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,129
and allowing the

576
00:19:57,639 --> 00:20:03,579
imitation control to sit on top of

577
00:20:00,129 --> 00:20:05,379
whatever topology or you know an

578
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:07,629
environment that we would desire to have

579
00:20:05,379 --> 00:20:10,149
we no longer compromising ourselves and

580
00:20:07,629 --> 00:20:12,609
to be honest if we're thinking about a

581
00:20:10,149 --> 00:20:15,399
true zero trust model where everything

582
00:20:12,609 --> 00:20:18,399
should be kind of self protecting you

583
00:20:15,399 --> 00:20:20,498
know and you have to justify and assert

584
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:23,079
that anything that wants to talk or act

585
00:20:20,499 --> 00:20:25,539
in a certain way has to justify by doing

586
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:28,690
that the only real way to do that is to

587
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:30,479
kind of D couple those two things allow

588
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:33,070
the network to be a fantastic network

589
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:36,190
allow the security or the segmentation

590
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:39,039
in this case to do segmentation on top

591
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:40,929
of that get a transponder in the car

592
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:43,570
onto each server and allow each server

593
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:44,559
to kind of do that themselves and I

594
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:45,908
think that's that's the way we're going

595
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,499
to achieve this and it but it brings

596
00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:48,879
with it a lot of benefits because if

597
00:20:47,499 --> 00:20:50,409
we're no longer reliant on the

598
00:20:48,879 --> 00:20:52,149
underlying network or the infrastructure

599
00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:53,589
or the hardware then suddenly all these

600
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:55,508
things like public clouds start to

601
00:20:53,589 --> 00:20:56,918
become a little lot easier because the

602
00:20:55,509 --> 00:20:59,019
fact that something's running in a cloud

603
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:02,889
versus on-prem is no longer a factor

604
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:05,200
because the control or the transponder

605
00:21:02,889 --> 00:21:07,988
is not on the network it's in the VM

606
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,659
it's in the is instance it's in the OS

607
00:21:07,989 --> 00:21:13,259
of the compute you're running not in the

608
00:21:10,659 --> 00:21:16,599
environment that's hosting that compute

609
00:21:13,259 --> 00:21:18,099
so decoupling is the security policy

610
00:21:16,599 --> 00:21:20,708
from the network infrastructure is

611
00:21:18,099 --> 00:21:24,009
actually going to make this possible but

612
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:25,089
saying that is really easy how are we

613
00:21:24,009 --> 00:21:27,190
going to go about doing that and what

614
00:21:25,089 --> 00:21:28,928
would we actually need to make that

615
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:31,029
decoupling effective and achieve this

616
00:21:28,929 --> 00:21:32,440
compartmentalizing strategy and these

617
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:34,719
are I think some of the key things that

618
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,389
are going to make this work the first

619
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:39,849
thing to make it work is if you try and

620
00:21:37,389 --> 00:21:41,619
add more and more segments to your

621
00:21:39,849 --> 00:21:44,619
environment more and more smaller

622
00:21:41,619 --> 00:21:48,029
compartments micro perimeters you have

623
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:50,589
to be able to visualize what

624
00:21:48,029 --> 00:21:52,599
communication or what traffic or then

625
00:21:50,589 --> 00:21:55,178
what the actions or the behavior of

626
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:55,539
those applications are because if you

627
00:21:55,179 --> 00:21:57,159
won't

628
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:59,169
you're gonna you're bound to break

629
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:00,190
something if you can't see it you won't

630
00:21:59,169 --> 00:22:01,809
be able to make the right decisions

631
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:03,669
about how those compartments should form

632
00:22:01,809 --> 00:22:07,089
so the first thing we really want is

633
00:22:03,669 --> 00:22:09,099
some form of a map if you like that will

634
00:22:07,089 --> 00:22:10,710
help us guide our way through to

635
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:12,240
building the right segments

636
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,950
but that map will also really be helpful

637
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:16,140
for a lot of other reasons because if we

638
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:18,600
can finally understand everything that's

639
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,700
going on in our extended data center

640
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:22,980
then there's a whole bunch of people in

641
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:26,429
the organization that can start to talk

642
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:28,169
about kind of a single view of truth the

643
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:29,730
apps teams have their context and they

644
00:22:28,169 --> 00:22:31,559
can visualize and understand their

645
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:33,179
application behavior the network teams

646
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:34,860
can see at a network level what's going

647
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:36,870
on between all those components the

648
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,370
infrastructure team know the server's

649
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:40,469
whether they be containers or virtual

650
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:42,719
where they reside they can talk the same

651
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:45,210
language and work off the same diagram

652
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,980
as well and they can all collaborate to

653
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:50,190
help build these compartments if you

654
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:51,419
like so understanding what you have at

655
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:52,799
any point in time becomes really

656
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:55,080
critical to be able to achieve this and

657
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,149
traditionally a network kind of

658
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,460
visualization tool or network profiling

659
00:22:57,149 --> 00:23:01,229
is good at the lowest level you can see

660
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:03,029
who's top talking and what's going on

661
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:05,640
but there's no real link back to the app

662
00:23:03,029 --> 00:23:07,770
context and the application kind of data

663
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,240
flow diagrams they're generally in Word

664
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:11,129
documents in a desk only the gnomon

665
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:12,480
reads or on SharePoint now they don't

666
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:14,669
really help you either in terms of a

667
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,929
reality of the situation so we need

668
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:17,640
something that kind of joins those two

669
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:19,529
things together and gives us a map that

670
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,690
includes both of those things app

671
00:23:19,529 --> 00:23:24,179
context network and infrastructure

672
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:25,919
that's the first thing and to be honest

673
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:27,240
that there has to be live and updating

674
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,980
it can't be a static point in time

675
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,860
because all around environments are

676
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:34,740
increasingly more and more dynamic and

677
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:37,620
we need to be able to see that in in a

678
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:38,940
moment of time all right the second

679
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,039
thing we probably going to need if we're

680
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:43,919
gonna start building segments is we're

681
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:46,770
gonna have to have a way of grouping or

682
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,059
labeling or logically representing the

683
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:51,779
systems that are going to make up those

684
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:54,299
segments and when we talk about systems

685
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:55,110
in a around a kind of a table or a

686
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:57,120
conference table

687
00:23:55,110 --> 00:24:00,059
we don't talk well that IP address is

688
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,279
talking my sequel to that IP address we

689
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:06,178
use things like with the middleware

690
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:08,370
server of application a now is that the

691
00:24:06,179 --> 00:24:09,840
dev one or the prod one is that the prod

692
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:12,719
one that the app the middleware server

693
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,760
and application a in prod is talking to

694
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,919
the database server in application a and

695
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,529
prod and this one's in Munich and this

696
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:20,970
one's in the Gold Coast so when we talk

697
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:22,990
about these systems we were already kind

698
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:25,240
of applying or understanding

699
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:27,520
characteristics of the role the

700
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:30,160
application the environment where it's

701
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:33,639
residing so wouldn't it be really

702
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:36,420
powerful if we started building or that

703
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,590
have the foundation of our segments

704
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:41,950
reflect that same cat those same

705
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:43,389
characteristics and not only does it

706
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:45,070
make it easier for us to understand them

707
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:47,080
and apply them but it also means we're

708
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:48,610
no longer talking or thinking in IP

709
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:50,020
addresses which is all ephemeral and

710
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:51,820
changes and I think the last talk was

711
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,900
all about that - how often IP address

712
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:55,899
has changed was one of the last

713
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:57,429
questions that was asked so getting away

714
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,470
from the technical properties of a

715
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:00,940
system and actually just grouping and

716
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:03,460
logically naming them so that's probably

717
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:05,950
the second thing we'd need a way of of

718
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,330
applying attributes and no simple ones

719
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,830
that are good enough we don't need a

720
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:11,260
whole bunch of things because that just

721
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:12,520
complicates the matter but a range of

722
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:14,020
those attributes that were apply to the

723
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,760
workloads so we can understand them and

724
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:18,340
if we keyed our segmentation strategy

725
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:20,260
off them suddenly everybody understands

726
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:22,090
every rule we're not concerned about

727
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,740
what does that firewall rule do well

728
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:26,350
what on earth is that thing in a list of

729
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:27,850
a thousand we can actually read these

730
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:31,270
off in English that would actually make

731
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:32,860
sense and finally the third thing that I

732
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:35,350
think is really important to any of this

733
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:38,229
and to help prevent breaking things

734
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:40,809
which is the death of security in a way

735
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:43,059
is that we have to be better than our

736
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:46,059
traditional security methods of being

737
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:47,980
able to model and test what this policy

738
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:51,399
is going to be and what it is going to

739
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:53,350
do before we apply it so we're not doing

740
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,330
our testing of our firewalls by applying

741
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:56,709
it and waiting for the phone to ring via

742
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:58,500
three different teams saying you've just

743
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:00,880
broken all my software what's going on

744
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:04,600
so having some method of and of

745
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:07,120
visualize map write policy that's in

746
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:10,290
English and then apply that in a staged

747
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,610
fashion that reduces the risk of

748
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:15,129
breaking applications or reduces the

749
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:18,100
network risk whilst not actually

750
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:20,650
affecting the network at all overlay

751
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:22,000
abstracting away would give us that

752
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:23,980
opportunity to actually build those

753
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,950
really effective signals and hopefully

754
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:28,510
you would agree there's probably the

755
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:29,740
three things are we gonna need so let me

756
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:31,780
take you through a little bit of an

757
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,130
example and this is sorry this is where

758
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:34,300
it gets a bit small certainly for those

759
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,870
at the back so I'll try and talk through

760
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:38,029
it as much as I possibly can

761
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:40,070
but if we think about securing something

762
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:42,110
by design or through its intent or its

763
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:43,789
behavior this is perhaps how we could go

764
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:45,889
about doing that or a sequence that we

765
00:26:43,789 --> 00:26:47,840
might end up following so I've got for

766
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:50,360
example a records management application

767
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,399
and already I'm thinking about the name

768
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:54,199
of it and it's running in my staging

769
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,150
environment out of a particular data

770
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,950
center it could be dug of DC or Equinix

771
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:59,630
or on my own private one but I'm

772
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,490
thinking about those properties already

773
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:03,620
and then in my head I thinking I know

774
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:05,450
what this application is made up of it's

775
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:07,760
a classic kind of three-tiered app of

776
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:09,919
web server middleware server database

777
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,750
server and I know what the

778
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,370
communications are between those and and

779
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:15,110
someone's talking to the web front-end

780
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:18,590
so I kind of got a picture of what this

781
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:20,090
thing is and what it should do and if I

782
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:23,510
was going to apply that same principle

783
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:26,330
of characterizing and writing a policy

784
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:29,419
that would say that only the

785
00:27:26,330 --> 00:27:32,178
interactions for this app to work should

786
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:36,740
be allowed and nothing else no implicit

787
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:38,450
allows no trust zones deny by default

788
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:40,100
everything's zero trust then this is

789
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:41,600
perhaps a rule set that would look to

790
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:44,090
build the rule set would be something

791
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,529
like this the scope of my application is

792
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:47,418
going to be the records manager app in

793
00:27:45,529 --> 00:27:49,309
dev and staging running in this data

794
00:27:47,419 --> 00:27:51,289
center and my rules are probably going

795
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:53,270
to be something like a select group of

796
00:27:51,289 --> 00:27:54,950
people can talk to the web front-end and

797
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,730
only the web front-end no one should be

798
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,830
able to get access to the database

799
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:59,510
directly that's the first rule in

800
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:01,850
English the second rule would then be

801
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:03,470
something like well the web tier should

802
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,939
always go through the middleware tier

803
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:06,380
because that's its vehicle that's

804
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:08,299
behavior it should never go direct to

805
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:11,360
the database so our web tier is going to

806
00:28:08,299 --> 00:28:12,918
talk to the middleware tier and we know

807
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,750
that it does that through you do and

808
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:17,750
hopefully the application teams are at

809
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:19,460
least aware of that through do and then

810
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:21,380
finally the middleware T is going to

811
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:23,630
talk to the sequel server in my case my

812
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:26,299
sequel server in terms of the database

813
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:28,700
and if we could write a policy that

814
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:30,770
looked like that very different than a

815
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,960
firewall set of firewall rules that have

816
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:35,149
to know all the IP addresses of all of

817
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,620
those three machines and we'll see in a

818
00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:39,439
few minutes what happens when we explode

819
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:41,889
those that's actually describing the

820
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,909
behavior or the intent and the minimum

821
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:46,070
behavior required for this application

822
00:28:43,909 --> 00:28:48,890
to work okay so that's kind of our

823
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:49,510
starting point and as we go through this

824
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,070
we're going to start

825
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:53,500
to see in my case it's a bit of a

826
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:55,090
changing evolving application and you'll

827
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,590
hopefully you'll start to realize that

828
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:58,840
if we were trying to do this of the

829
00:28:56,590 --> 00:29:00,429
traditional ways it's going to be really

830
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:04,060
challenging to maintain that same

831
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:06,220
security policy so in this case some

832
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:09,460
bright executives decided that we have a

833
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:11,710
cloud first strategy and is determined

834
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:13,900
from on high that everything now must

835
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:16,240
run in the public cloud and so this

836
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:17,320
advocate this is a bit synthetic because

837
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,820
no one's just going to pick this thing

838
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:21,070
up and run it immediately in the clever

839
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:22,659
cloud but we're gonna we're going to

840
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:25,030
take this and put this in Amazon and and

841
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:26,770
in doing so well what would transform it

842
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:28,120
a little bit as well and we'll make use

843
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:29,710
of some of the you know path services

844
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:31,389
out of Amazon so make it a little bit

845
00:29:29,710 --> 00:29:34,180
more a bit of experience in that sense

846
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:35,470
but in terms of our policy for those

847
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,060
that can see you'll note that the

848
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:38,440
behavior of the app actually hasn't

849
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:40,960
changed the only thing that has changed

850
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:44,200
is the locations no longer Equinix its

851
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:46,180
amazon southeast and the fact that our

852
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:49,360
database is now an RDS server instead of

853
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:51,250
a VM running my sequel for example okay

854
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:52,990
so that that's a minimal change to our

855
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:55,750
policy which could actually be applied

856
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:57,580
really easy through orchestration okay

857
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:59,170
so that's the second one then of course

858
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:01,210
this application is ready to promote

859
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:02,260
into production so we're in staging

860
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,800
we've done our testing we're now to go

861
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,900
into production

862
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,190
what is that change to our policy well

863
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,170
the behavior of the application again

864
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:10,360
has not changed now we just need to

865
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:12,370
apply that same policy to the production

866
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,600
instance as well as applying it to our

867
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:15,909
dev and test instances

868
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:20,080
so again minimal change to the concept

869
00:30:15,910 --> 00:30:21,820
of our policy but achieving that same

870
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,230
goal of separating those applications

871
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:25,240
from each other and this is where it

872
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:27,340
starts to get really cool because if we

873
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,440
start elastically expanding any one of

874
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:30,520
those web tiers in our traditional model

875
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,810
where to start worrying about what are

876
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,340
they all that IP addresses of all these

877
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:35,860
new machines in the web tier that we've

878
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:38,560
just expanded up in this model our

879
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:41,020
policy has remained the same completely

880
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:42,790
because our web tier is still talking to

881
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:46,150
the middle bits here using Moodle

882
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:47,710
the behavior has not changed so this

883
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:49,690
attribute model becomes really riku to

884
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:52,090
achieving this goal and allowing that

885
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:54,040
dynamic nature and then hey let's go

886
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:55,480
ahead and containerized this thing and

887
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:57,820
now we've got a containers we got pairs

888
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:00,130
we got Amazon and we've got this kind of

889
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:01,570
classic application architecture again

890
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,980
our policy hasn't changed just because

891
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:05,500
the web tier is now containers

892
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:08,140
versus VMs the database is no longer

893
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:10,059
physical it's pass hasn't really

894
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:12,340
affected the behavior and shouldn't

895
00:31:10,059 --> 00:31:14,710
really affect our security policy if we

896
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:16,840
do this well and tie that policy to

897
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:19,630
behavior and intent then we shouldn't

898
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:22,120
have any impact on that so how could we

899
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:23,799
really kind of finish this off and I

900
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:26,080
hopefully this is posing questions to

901
00:31:23,799 --> 00:31:27,970
you as to kind of ultimately how is this

902
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,320
going to work and I'd love you guys to

903
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,850
come over to the alumi o booth and we

904
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,439
can talk about it more and in fact if

905
00:31:30,850 --> 00:31:34,059
you're around at 3:40 this afternoon

906
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,169
we're doing a prize draw for a drone so

907
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,350
if you haven't got a ticket for that all

908
00:31:35,169 --> 00:31:37,510
right

909
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:39,370
already come over there or grab one from

910
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:42,429
the guys at the back but fundamentally

911
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:43,928
if we can decouple the security practice

912
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:46,150
away from the network the network guys

913
00:31:43,929 --> 00:31:47,799
can concentrate on building the fastest

914
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:49,660
highest performing reliable network that

915
00:31:47,799 --> 00:31:52,090
they want without compromising their

916
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:53,470
work the infrastructure team can be

917
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:56,168
happy in the sense that they can

918
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:57,940
provision any type of resource physical

919
00:31:56,169 --> 00:32:00,400
VM container whatever it might be in the

920
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:02,950
future in the appropriate place cloud

921
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:06,010
private regardless they not compromising

922
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:07,750
themselves the security group are really

923
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:10,480
happy because they're achieving granular

924
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:13,240
policy a much you know more control than

925
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,980
they've ever had before at a speed which

926
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:17,169
is so much more faster than they've ever

927
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:19,390
had before and the application teams

928
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:21,130
kind of assist in this process of

929
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:22,510
potentially defining their policy and

930
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:24,220
operating the policy and they're not

931
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:25,990
slowed down they're they're going at

932
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:28,840
DevOps speed as fast as they can and

933
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:31,270
they're not they're having a part to

934
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:32,620
play in achieving that goal and they're

935
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:34,210
not slowed down by infrastructure of

936
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:36,219
security as well so it sounds like a bit

937
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:39,429
of a Nirvana and I promise you it's all

938
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:41,770
very much possible as long as we

939
00:32:39,429 --> 00:32:43,240
decoupled our security from the network

940
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:45,460
so what are the kind of the key

941
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,080
takeaways to this and when you think

942
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:50,440
about zero trust it's a big framework

943
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:52,449
around self protecting systems and you

944
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,280
know isolating each other and users to

945
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:55,929
systems and data and systems these are

946
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:57,970
some of the practical steps that you can

947
00:32:55,929 --> 00:32:59,740
actually take to start achieving that

948
00:32:57,970 --> 00:33:02,290
goal that you've heard about but you may

949
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:04,360
be not necessarily at that point yet or

950
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:06,418
on that journey and the first thing is

951
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:09,070
that we've got to be able to identify

952
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:10,960
those systems and visualize those

953
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:13,090
systems that hold that really important

954
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,500
data if we don't understand that if we

955
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:16,270
can't see that if we don't have them in

956
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,760
real time we're not going to be able to

957
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:20,410
achieve

958
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,510
the second one is that we want to be

959
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:25,060
able to architect these security

960
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:27,970
policies that are micro perimeters and a

961
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:30,700
small small segment segments maybe all

962
00:33:27,970 --> 00:33:33,070
the way down to single VMs or processes

963
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:36,010
running in VMs if we want to but be able

964
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:38,080
to architect those test them visualize

965
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:39,700
what their impact would be before we

966
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,860
flick the switch to actually enforce

967
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:44,710
them and that's a vital part of that

968
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:48,159
process thirdly underpinning all of this

969
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:50,740
we've got to get away from that concept

970
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:52,450
of building fences or that kind of

971
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,740
outside in approach of well we'll try

972
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:54,970
and block it and if they get through

973
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:56,770
we're trying to take them and get them

974
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:59,380
out as quick as we can we've got to kind

975
00:33:56,770 --> 00:34:03,400
of flip that on its head and a plan for

976
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:05,830
breach and plan beyond a breach and go

977
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,840
for a default denying model you know

978
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:10,179
where everyone is self protecting and

979
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,489
only having to justify having to you

980
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:14,830
know approve a flow because that is

981
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:16,239
required as opposed to I live in a

982
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:18,668
segment that is open and can be

983
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:20,560
communicated in this way and then

984
00:34:18,668 --> 00:34:22,600
finally as kind of the example I just

985
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,610
showed you before if we have either an

986
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,529
application that's evolving or different

987
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:27,730
teams within our enterprise that are

988
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:29,620
running at different speeds with

989
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:31,330
different technology trains we've got to

990
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:33,819
be able to have a way that can both

991
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:36,668
automate or orchestrate this approach so

992
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:39,820
that it adapts to the environment that

993
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:41,679
you have and those network centric

994
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,970
approaches or hypervisor approaches or

995
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,950
whatever it might be that we might have

996
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:45,908
today just can't keep up with that they

997
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:48,549
just can't adapt and they're not

998
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:50,500
designed to achieve that okay so that's

999
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:52,659
that's kind of my practical steps if you

1000
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:54,550
like for going through zero trust and I

1001
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:55,840
think we're pretty much on five minutes

1002
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:57,190
to go now and what I do want to do is

1003
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,230
make sure there's enough time for Q&A

1004
00:34:57,190 --> 00:35:00,550
and hopefully there are there are some

1005
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:01,750
questions in the audience I hope you

1006
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:03,040
have piqued your interest enough not in

1007
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:04,540
telling you how to go about doing it

1008
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,610
necessarily but it's certainly possible

1009
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,779
to achieve all of this and so I'll open

1010
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:08,980
it up and now for thank you very much

1011
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:14,490
for your time this afternoon but I'll

1012
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:14,490
open up for some Q&A thank you

1013
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:33,980
is there anybody yes thank you yeah yes

1014
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:35,210
yeah that's a very good question so the

1015
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:38,030
question was I had a slide there that

1016
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:40,460
kind of identified attributes of systems

1017
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:41,990
in the data center in a very sink trick

1018
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:44,990
around the data center but we had that

1019
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:46,970
concept of a company HQ or certain users

1020
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,660
accessing the front of that system how

1021
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:49,189
would we do that

1022
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:52,879
well I think in a similar way we've got

1023
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:55,100
to be able to identify users using an

1024
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,510
identity framework in some way and it's

1025
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:58,160
not necessarily the same set of

1026
00:35:56,510 --> 00:36:00,680
attributes they don't have a role in an

1027
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,810
app in an environment but they do have a

1028
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:04,850
role that they play in the enterprise

1029
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:06,470
that would suggest that they should be

1030
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:08,750
able to interact with certain systems in

1031
00:36:06,470 --> 00:36:11,000
the data center and so yeah being able

1032
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:13,430
to apply that identity to that person

1033
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,840
and then have a policy that says well

1034
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:17,089
those types of people are allowed to

1035
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:18,500
access the systems so when we think

1036
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:19,640
about in the Illumina world we think

1037
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,010
about that is kind of their

1038
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:24,200
participation in AD or you know a

1039
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:25,970
directory service what role do they play

1040
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,339
and how would they kind of interact with

1041
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:30,439
the front end but really importantly

1042
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:32,030
it's not how would they interact with

1043
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:35,510
that whole app it's how do they interact

1044
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:37,070
specifically over HTTP only to only the

1045
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:38,090
web front end or whatever that might be

1046
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:40,760
so that you're reducing the attack

1047
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:43,520
surface so yeah that the person and the

1048
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,580
system kind of I guess merge a little

1049
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,840
bit in terms of each one has an identity

1050
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:50,450
and then you're writing policies on

1051
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,380
those identities so hope you know does

1052
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:53,210
that hopefully that answers your

1053
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:54,950
question yeah but we can certainly

1054
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:57,920
extend this concept beyond the data

1055
00:36:54,950 --> 00:37:00,549
center into user land as well yeah

1056
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,550
please and obey

1057
00:37:04,729 --> 00:37:10,919
yeah I think I think certainly that the

1058
00:37:08,699 --> 00:37:12,359
concept of it as a framework is equally

1059
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:14,189
applicable in into any type of

1060
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:15,630
environment I guess there are different

1061
00:37:14,189 --> 00:37:19,078
challenges with the different IT

1062
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:20,759
environments that you have and in terms

1063
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:21,959
of the way a loomio thinks about this

1064
00:37:20,759 --> 00:37:24,150
problem how we've approached this

1065
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:26,999
problem there are some types of systems

1066
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:30,059
that perhaps harder to approach this

1067
00:37:26,999 --> 00:37:32,759
from a host based methodology because

1068
00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:34,049
that host is maybe a black box T or it's

1069
00:37:32,759 --> 00:37:37,380
an appliance or something that you can't

1070
00:37:34,049 --> 00:37:40,529
necessarily interact with that well so

1071
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:43,140
yeah there are cases where you may need

1072
00:37:40,529 --> 00:37:44,910
to kind of think about well what is

1073
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:47,069
something that we could use it sits in

1074
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:49,439
front of that particular SCADA system or

1075
00:37:47,069 --> 00:37:52,680
that ot system they could kind of front

1076
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:55,229
that identity or front that that so we

1077
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,519
could apply policy at that point but

1078
00:37:55,229 --> 00:37:58,198
yeah SCADA systems are a little bit

1079
00:37:56,519 --> 00:38:00,718
different and maybe you can extend that

1080
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:03,029
into medical devices and medical

1081
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:04,979
equipment for example as well MRI

1082
00:38:03,029 --> 00:38:07,589
machines that you can't play with for

1083
00:38:04,979 --> 00:38:08,819
example so I think but one of the key

1084
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:10,140
things that we have found in talking to

1085
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:12,779
a lot of customers around this is it's

1086
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:14,699
still that boundary between IT and ot is

1087
00:38:12,779 --> 00:38:17,369
still a very important one that can this

1088
00:38:14,699 --> 00:38:19,199
this is very applicable for and then

1089
00:38:17,369 --> 00:38:21,390
depending on kind of the makeup of your

1090
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:23,640
ot environment how far you can get that

1091
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:24,989
down to each self protecting system

1092
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,779
versus what might need to sit in front

1093
00:38:24,989 --> 00:38:30,079
of it but it's a very good question No

1094
00:38:27,779 --> 00:38:30,079
thank you

1095
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:43,630
oh yes right yeah one more use at all

1096
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,799
yeah I mean I I tried very hard not to

1097
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:47,140
talk about a loom you know too much but

1098
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,610
Italy mio is a software solution that

1099
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:50,109
provides all of these things and then

1100
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:52,960
one of the fundamentals is that map and

1101
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:54,550
we actually have a series of those types

1102
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,540
of maps that are kind of relevant to the

1103
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:57,250
different person that might be

1104
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:59,259
interacting with the system it's kind of

1105
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:01,390
a security guy versus an infrastructure

1106
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:02,890
type person but yeah fundamentally if

1107
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:05,049
you need something that visualizes

1108
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:06,819
across the entire environment it's got

1109
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:09,190
to work everywhere and it's kind of got

1110
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:11,380
to work at a big scale so yeah we have

1111
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:13,060
written some technology and that they

1112
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:15,880
will do that up to you know hundreds of

1113
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:17,830
thousands of servers potentially but yes

1114
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:23,170
it's fundamental to I think to be able

1115
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:24,759
to achieve any of this yeah why do you

1116
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:26,800
thought of getting the the northern I

1117
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:28,120
think we're up to times I'd love to keep

1118
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,110
talking to you guys but thank you thank

1119
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,690
you very much for the questions I really

1120
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:34,230
appreciate it have a great day

1121
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:34,230
thanks very much thunder
