1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,489
I have alia Bosch oven and his

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:06,750
presentation is on practical network

3
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,240
security automation

4
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,059
Ali is from the Coles Group Limited if

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,699
you can give him a walk-on applause guys

6
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:15,699
[Applause]

7
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:21,900
good morning everyone thanks for making

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:27,230
the time should all be sober by now

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,229
hopefully and should I need more coffee

10
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:38,190
so practical network security automation

11
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:41,430
is a topic for this presentation so just

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:44,370
to give you a view on what's ahead of us

13
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:47,219
in this presentation or briefly cover

14
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:51,449
the current landscape some of the

15
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:54,570
challenges and expectations from us then

16
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:56,968
we'll go through different flavors of

17
00:00:54,570 --> 00:01:00,570
automation and why we shouldn't be

18
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:03,809
calling everything AI and it because

19
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:06,570
it's just cool or it's automated

20
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:09,390
then we'll hopefully get to the more

21
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:12,270
exciting part that is the two use cases

22
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:16,580
that I've selected the first one is a

23
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:19,490
reactive use case where we see how

24
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:23,250
automated threat blocking could work and

25
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:26,280
the second one is a more of a proactive

26
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:32,759
nature so to implement a wife in front

27
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:34,530
of an API gateway towards the end we'll

28
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,030
have a look at a summary and hopefully

29
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:38,579
I'll give everyone something to take

30
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:41,100
away from this talking if I manage my

31
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,110
time well I should be able to take some

32
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:48,689
questions

33
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:50,850
we'll see so what are we dealing with I

34
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:53,669
would like to put a few things into

35
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:56,880
perspective in no matter where you are

36
00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:04,439
in the hierarchy they have an impact on

37
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:07,110
you so the growth in cyber crime and I

38
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:10,679
promise I'm not going to use the term

39
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:12,840
cyber anything after this a slide so

40
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,950
we'll see increasing number of cyber

41
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:16,940
crime activity

42
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:20,250
we see more cyber criminals that are

43
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:24,450
better equipped and are better organized

44
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:27,030
so let's say 15 20 years ago it's not

45
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:29,450
that there were fewer smart people on

46
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:33,900
the planet were capable of doing

47
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:36,839
outstanding cybercrime I guess we were

48
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,959
dealing with smart individuals were less

49
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:43,440
organized and had access to limited

50
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:47,239
resources but today cybercrime as a

51
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:51,180
service has pretty much bridged that gap

52
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:55,890
so this is now turning to a very

53
00:02:51,180 --> 00:03:00,209
lucrative business for for those who

54
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:02,850
know how and where to go and obtain the

55
00:03:00,209 --> 00:03:07,709
different pieces of puzzle so then they

56
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:12,750
can pull off a true global operation and

57
00:03:07,709 --> 00:03:17,989
sadly still it's worth a try for the

58
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:17,989
board or the idiots or the near duels a

59
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:29,220
wider attack surface so pretty much a

60
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:32,399
byproduct of utilizing more tech we have

61
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:36,150
more data stored and accessed outside

62
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,390
the organization's four walls than ever

63
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:42,510
before for sure and we have more devices

64
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:44,730
that are inside our networks but they

65
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:49,040
want to call home they just want to be

66
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:49,040
managed from outside our organization

67
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:56,430
yep we we have to move faster and

68
00:03:54,329 --> 00:04:00,989
everything is agile so what are our

69
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:05,430
mantras lean and fail fast so we are

70
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:08,609
less willing to spend time on elaborate

71
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:11,220
discovery and prolong design and endless

72
00:04:08,609 --> 00:04:13,769
planning because because the world

73
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,750
around us is just moving too fast now we

74
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:21,000
can't really you don't have that time

75
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:23,240
anymore and resource challenge is

76
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,020
probably for most organization is not

77
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,880
monetary resources it's it's people so

78
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:32,810
it's it's difficult to find the right

79
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,690
people it's it's not easy to keep them

80
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:39,620
motivated and and definitely it's not

81
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:41,630
easy to retain them then we get to the

82
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:44,360
classic dollar figures for your optics

83
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:47,300
and capex in and also the organization's

84
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:50,240
ability to manage and deliver projects

85
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:55,370
and programs and roadmaps which takes a

86
00:04:50,240 --> 00:05:00,440
lot of human intellects so this is a fun

87
00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:02,630
slide if I had one of these I could

88
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:07,759
pretty much conclude the target would

89
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:10,430
just head to an early lunch but I tried

90
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:14,210
to buy one of these online for myself

91
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:17,389
and my boss just to remind him more to

92
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:20,690
the point that there may exist but they

93
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:22,940
can't really fix everything and and to

94
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,680
be honest it wasn't easy so I spent a

95
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,690
good 10-15 minutes just searching

96
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:29,479
through the results of different things

97
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:31,430
then I managed to find one that was also

98
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:35,150
a USB storage they wasn't totally

99
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:41,000
useless so that was pretty cool but

100
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:46,599
jokes aside automation is an area that

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:50,509
can definitely help us so it scales well

102
00:05:46,599 --> 00:05:56,120
better than we do it moves faster than

103
00:05:50,509 --> 00:05:58,340
us no start saying that it's reliable

104
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,620
and it's accurate and the general

105
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:03,049
disclaimer there is the usual garbage in

106
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:10,330
garbage out so there drools always

107
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:12,860
applies so quick clarification of on

108
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:16,000
what do we mean by automation and I'll

109
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:21,590
be using a true police terminology here

110
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:25,280
I'll have this arrow on the side for us

111
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:31,429
to better associate each category of

112
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:33,770
software with doing versus thinking and

113
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:36,169
I will start with robotic desktop

114
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:39,560
automation so we're talking about an

115
00:06:36,169 --> 00:06:40,880
application that has a set of predefined

116
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,120
steps to complete

117
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:47,719
an activity or a process and these steps

118
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:48,470
could be across multiple different

119
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:51,380
systems

120
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:55,700
the important thing here is the the

121
00:06:51,380 --> 00:07:02,240
operator still initiates and manages the

122
00:06:55,700 --> 00:07:05,180
workflow through then comes the robotic

123
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:09,020
process automation so the software is

124
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:11,450
getting smarter the application uses

125
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:15,740
business rules or and and it does it

126
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:20,390
autonomously to execute those activities

127
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:23,420
or processes and the important factor

128
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:29,870
here is the operator only manages the

129
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:34,070
exceptions so this is so this is the

130
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:38,150
process driven territory where the focus

131
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:43,420
is automating repetitive tasks so pretty

132
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:43,419
much we're trying to mimic human actions

133
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:51,380
then we get to the data-driven territory

134
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:56,510
where the focused kind of changes

135
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:58,969
towards learning and thinking and the

136
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:04,159
important facet here is you have to have

137
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:07,490
access to good quality data and again

138
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:10,760
with the goal to to simulate human

139
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:14,000
intelligence so we start with machine

140
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:20,120
learning here where we feed an

141
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:23,270
application a lot of data so these are

142
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:26,000
captured successful and poor on

143
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:29,030
successful operations so we essentially

144
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,430
teaching the software so or or the

145
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:33,439
software is observing on IR actions and

146
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:35,479
and the end goal here is for the

147
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,990
software to be able to detect and

148
00:08:35,479 --> 00:08:42,380
recognize and recognize patterns and

149
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:46,990
correlate so they eventually can provide

150
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,990
us predictions or decisions if you like

151
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:56,620
and the holy grail of AI which it's the

152
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:00,959
combination of pretty much everything

153
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:04,980
so if mouthfuls like cognitive

154
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:07,060
automation or machine learning reasoning

155
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,449
analysis natural language processing

156
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:15,369
they all combine here and the end goal

157
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:20,800
is to produce insight and analytics at

158
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:22,860
or above de human capability so this is

159
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:29,199
where it gets a little bit scary or

160
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:31,899
human ego confronting so that should be

161
00:09:29,199 --> 00:09:33,639
enough dose of intelligent process

162
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:36,279
automation and with that out of the way

163
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:39,880
I can I can tell you that most of this

164
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:42,880
presentation is focused in the process

165
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:45,910
driven area so I'll comfortably leave

166
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:52,720
the data-driven area to smarter

167
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:56,920
presenters so I'll try to set the scene

168
00:09:52,720 --> 00:10:01,089
for the first use case of it so security

169
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:05,589
teams are usually tasked to protect our

170
00:10:01,089 --> 00:10:11,139
people or compute our data and also know

171
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:13,170
networks from threats so one of the ways

172
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:16,120
that we do that is by deploying

173
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:19,349
technologies and we we essentially rely

174
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:22,029
on those technologies to protect us

175
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:25,149
next-generation firewalls or previous

176
00:10:22,029 --> 00:10:27,040
generation firewalls WAAFs or email

177
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:32,050
filtering or endpoint protection the

178
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:35,259
list goes on and on so this also right

179
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:37,899
now goes across our current on-prem

180
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:40,509
deployment and all the way to our

181
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:44,529
infrastructure as a service and in cases

182
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:48,310
in our platform as a service what they

183
00:10:44,529 --> 00:10:50,829
all have in common is that all observed

184
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:54,550
traffic and order behavior and make

185
00:10:50,829 --> 00:10:58,149
decisions to either allow or deny and

186
00:10:54,550 --> 00:11:01,149
that decision is made based on their

187
00:10:58,149 --> 00:11:02,100
individual view of the world or their

188
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:05,870
definition

189
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,870
of what is malicious or what is benign

190
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:13,259
for example most of us if not all of us

191
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:16,350
have already blocked SMB traffic on our

192
00:11:13,259 --> 00:11:18,720
perimeter firewall so there's almost no

193
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:22,380
use case for it to be open in the

194
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:25,440
internet or towards the Internet so and

195
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:27,389
when the eternal blue vulnerability came

196
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,100
at least you had one less vector to

197
00:11:27,389 --> 00:11:35,550
worry about so that's an example of a a

198
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:38,399
simple and very effective configuration

199
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:44,279
that you made on that piece of tech to

200
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:46,800
to protect yourself it's funny when I

201
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:50,370
was doing your slides I did a showdown

202
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:54,269
search on TCP 4 4 5 and you can still

203
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:56,880
see around 1.7 million hosts just just

204
00:11:54,269 --> 00:11:58,440
listening on that port switch which you

205
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,910
don't know what to make of it is it just

206
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:05,069
oh honey pot that researchers have

207
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:06,899
brought up to see how the world's doing

208
00:12:05,069 --> 00:12:15,229
or are there really enterprises or

209
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:21,680
end-users hard to tell so not every

210
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:25,589
detection is as simple so imagining a

211
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:28,620
customer who is shopping for a selection

212
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:32,069
of wine from Euro Valley which is a very

213
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:36,569
nice place in Victoria so they added to

214
00:12:32,069 --> 00:12:40,829
the cart the customer then puts in the

215
00:12:36,569 --> 00:12:46,050
delivery address and say that's number

216
00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:51,930
blah Union Lane 3 victoria 3000 and they

217
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:55,290
click Next and then they say this page

218
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:59,008
which tries to mimic the look and feel

219
00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:02,550
of the website but it fails to blend in

220
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:05,819
it has a 403 error with a long reference

221
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:08,250
number there and it's it's it's actually

222
00:13:05,819 --> 00:13:10,050
telling the customer write it down and

223
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:14,059
give us a call we'll definitely look at

224
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:14,059
it and of course you would

225
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:23,550
so the funny thing is they the customer

226
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:28,439
can still buy beer or any other type of

227
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:33,240
wine or they can actually ship that

228
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:34,949
product to their mom's address so you'd

229
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,410
think this is probably a parental

230
00:13:34,949 --> 00:13:41,849
control what's very advanced we'll find

231
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:44,149
out so under the hood you have something

232
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:47,819
like this it says what the product is

233
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:50,430
was what the address is it still looks

234
00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:53,149
fine until you get the wife to look at

235
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:58,739
or to apply some sequel injection

236
00:13:53,149 --> 00:14:00,959
signatures to it in in its mind you

237
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:03,300
would have just three key words that he

238
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,579
cares about it's there's Union select

239
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,529
and from and the combination in that

240
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:08,758
area it's probably a bad thing so it's

241
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:13,620
just gonna drop it and show you that

242
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:16,170
page so before you get angry at me yes

243
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:19,199
signatures could be tunes but the point

244
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:22,769
that I'm trying to make here is false

245
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:30,439
positives are hard to spot and are

246
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:33,209
difficult to cater for proactively so

247
00:14:30,439 --> 00:14:36,480
what we have learned over the years is

248
00:14:33,209 --> 00:14:42,180
that single device view of the world is

249
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:44,370
incomplete so what can we do to have a

250
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:46,290
wider view of what's happening or a

251
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:48,870
panoramic view of our network

252
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:54,319
interestingly we most of us already

253
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:57,509
collecting a lot of what our devices are

254
00:14:54,319 --> 00:15:02,639
observing and sending them to a central

255
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:06,259
location did that because same and we

256
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:11,069
have a combination of people and

257
00:15:06,259 --> 00:15:13,740
processes or use cases of rule sets that

258
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:15,420
are that are massaging their daughter

259
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:20,579
and turning them into a sort of an

260
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:23,699
intelligence for us and we applied data

261
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:25,290
enrichment and correlation and those

262
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:27,930
sort of techniques to build a more

263
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:31,140
complete view of what is actually happy

264
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:35,699
so so we can so we can tell what is

265
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:38,580
malicious and what is benign but but the

266
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:42,149
problem is that that intelligence exists

267
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:46,410
outside the brain of the device that's

268
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:49,500
doing the actual enforcement so the

269
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:51,360
challenge is then is if I know what I

270
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:54,959
want to drop or whatever the block but I

271
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:57,330
have to tell some other devices and I

272
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,369
have to do it very quickly you know have

273
00:15:57,330 --> 00:16:00,899
to be able to do it frequently so I can

274
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:05,940
update it as fast as I can because

275
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:09,870
that's what it makes sense and it can

276
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:13,860
also extend across my on-prem or my

277
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:16,920
cloud how can I do that and and this is

278
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:19,970
where automation can potentially help us

279
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,969
and can really shine

280
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:34,819
so we gather each devices individual

281
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:38,600
view we then use our people processes

282
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:42,380
and technology on the side to to help us

283
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:44,180
to print and produce combine it all

284
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:50,660
together and build a more complete view

285
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:53,780
of how things are actually working that

286
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:57,350
that produces us and in actionable

287
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:59,240
intelligence or that you can can also

288
00:16:57,350 --> 00:17:02,240
call it your own threat intelligence

289
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:05,630
feed which which is essentially a list

290
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:09,800
it could be based on source IP addresses

291
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:13,339
it could be based on whips let's say web

292
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:17,290
session IDs or in more advanced cases it

293
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:20,448
could be a user or device fingerprint

294
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:23,599
that's how you are identified a threat

295
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:26,089
and it's it's essentially dependent on

296
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:29,510
your enforcement point so what is the

297
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:32,929
capability of the enforcement point what

298
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:36,860
can it work with you turn that into a

299
00:17:32,930 --> 00:17:39,020
list and you put it on a source

300
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:43,540
repository that's where you can then

301
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:46,490
share it with your other platforms and

302
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:49,610
you can then point your automations

303
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:51,430
service to it let's say you're using

304
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:55,429
ansible for automation

305
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:58,310
so you find financeable module for your

306
00:17:55,430 --> 00:18:01,160
invoice enforcement device or if it's

307
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:03,230
missing you just build one develop one

308
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,840
most of the devices already have a API

309
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:07,670
just create a wrap around the API and

310
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,429
turn it into an answerable module and

311
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:12,290
then your automation will pick up that

312
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:16,580
list it understands that it's kind of

313
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:22,700
translates it into what they the

314
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:24,800
protection device can do so you then you

315
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:28,250
can update it or all your devices or

316
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:32,149
multiple devices from many vendors or

317
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:34,970
across many locations and as frequently

318
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:37,130
as you would like it to and and after

319
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:39,530
that what would be what we do we just

320
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:40,970
continue to watch what is happening and

321
00:18:39,530 --> 00:18:43,280
we update that list

322
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:47,560
we know that the list will be propagated

323
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,560
all the way to our protective devices

324
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:55,520
I'd love to share some some

325
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:59,020
considerations here with you so the

326
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:04,100
first one is to to test this system

327
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:05,930
vigorously so feed it the whole Internet

328
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,939
address space through it all the whole

329
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:10,540
session idea space to it

330
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:13,160
I'd say test the device limitations

331
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:14,840
feeling correct data to it find what it

332
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:17,960
does tested at different times of the

333
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:20,030
day or day of the week or month or

334
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:24,980
tested in the year 2050 and see how it

335
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:27,620
behaves so make sure it's as bug free as

336
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:32,870
it possibly can get to and it's very

337
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:35,830
critical implement a whitelist so this

338
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:39,010
is sir void accidental blocks on

339
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:42,980
important sources and also the fact that

340
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:44,870
there will always be exceptions to them

341
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:47,630
to the normal treatment so you you have

342
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:49,729
trusted sources such as let's say your

343
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:52,100
proxy servers or your monitoring

344
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:54,800
platforms with those solar areas or even

345
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:56,899
a temporary pen tester that you want to

346
00:19:54,800 --> 00:20:01,430
have access to test some of your stuff

347
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:05,510
and you don't want to block him have a

348
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:08,810
kill switch so manual override is not

349
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:10,940
only necessary for airplanes everywhere

350
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:13,460
that we have automation we have to have

351
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:19,360
a way to say everything can stop or I

352
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:21,950
can take over completely if you have

353
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,770
reliable same use cases that can

354
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:26,960
distinguish malicious from benign and

355
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:30,710
you you trust them you've tested them

356
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:32,390
you can connect that detection engine to

357
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:34,820
your automation so as soon as it's

358
00:20:32,390 --> 00:20:38,960
detected it goes all the way and

359
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:40,909
actually block the threat so again you

360
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,860
just have to make sure you you're not

361
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:45,350
rushing it you're testing it in parallel

362
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:48,100
you've made sure it's it's as boria's

363
00:20:45,350 --> 00:20:48,100
you can get to

364
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:56,450
give you or Security Operations Center

365
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:58,310
an ability to to view the outcome and

366
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:01,280
the way that the automation is working

367
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:03,830
just to give them the confidence that P

368
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:05,450
he human can still do exception handling

369
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,760
but if there are issues there are

370
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:10,430
someone's watching and can go and use

371
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:16,540
the kill switch or recorded as a bug and

372
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:19,940
deal with it change advisory board so

373
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:22,659
they are there to protect the business

374
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:26,360
from Cowboys in OIT

375
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:29,270
so automation doesn't look like it

376
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:32,659
threat to them there will be skeptical

377
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:36,410
of what automation can do and more to

378
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:40,640
the point what automation can break and

379
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:42,800
how it can break the business so they do

380
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:44,540
most care about the change risk than

381
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:48,500
anything yeah also you need to educate

382
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:50,030
them and build confidence that can be

383
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:52,010
achieved through a number of things you

384
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:55,129
can have can run workshops about

385
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:58,220
automation just educate a bit about what

386
00:21:55,130 --> 00:22:02,990
it can do to what it cannot do and also

387
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:05,060
take them through your testings and all

388
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:06,560
the controls that you've implemented are

389
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:08,960
pretty much the things that we've talked

390
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:11,510
up until here that that should give them

391
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:19,490
a bit more confidence that you're not

392
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:22,610
that cowboy definitely review and even

393
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:24,560
do a proof of concept for security

394
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:27,260
orchestration automation and response

395
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:30,950
tools they don't need shorts or so this

396
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:34,640
is a classic buy versus build so there

397
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:36,290
are pros and cons on both so in the

398
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,770
right answer is it depends

399
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:42,950
oh I will probably be a bit biased

400
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:47,500
towards the use of generic automation to

401
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:52,010
set and I have more Pro arguments for

402
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:54,500
using a general automation so but so

403
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:59,480
sewer tools do promise a lot of good

404
00:22:54,500 --> 00:23:01,640
things but they they don't support

405
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,960
everything right out of the box so you

406
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,000
will see platform

407
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,450
ones that they don't support or they

408
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:10,610
have even have no plan to support and

409
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:13,190
you will end up with something that you

410
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:15,469
either have to pay to be billed or you

411
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:18,500
have to build it yourself like a module

412
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:20,659
or a plug-in even the supported devices

413
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,700
you you still have to integrate it so

414
00:23:20,659 --> 00:23:27,289
it's it's similar to what you do with

415
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:30,590
your own automation the the other

416
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:35,120
benefit of using general automation is

417
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:39,500
that you're not just limited to to use

418
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:42,080
soar in a classic response method so you

419
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:45,169
can use your general automation to do

420
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,600
other BAU activity so you know you're

421
00:23:45,169 --> 00:23:49,909
not just focused on security operation

422
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:57,980
center and how they react to day-to-day

423
00:23:49,909 --> 00:24:00,919
threats the second use case that are

424
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:04,220
going to you guys gonna go going to see

425
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:07,010
shortly is a proactive security control

426
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:09,169
to implement laughs in front of API

427
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:15,500
gateways so again I'll try to set the

428
00:24:09,169 --> 00:24:18,260
scene so reality check number one so

429
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:21,440
most of people in this room are probably

430
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:25,549
using DevOps practices anyway so teams

431
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:28,700
will ramp up quickly and develop the

432
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:33,789
code and pretty much automate a lot of

433
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:36,049
staff all the way to deployments because

434
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:38,029
deployments and especially deployment in

435
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:40,789
production and automating that is is not

436
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:44,390
a trivial task it's it takes a lot of

437
00:24:40,789 --> 00:24:50,690
effort and there are just so many moving

438
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:53,299
parts so you can elect not to automate

439
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:54,710
that part but if if you consider

440
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:57,830
something that is changing very

441
00:24:54,710 --> 00:25:00,740
frequently you need to get ready to hire

442
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:04,689
because you will need an army of techies

443
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:06,860
to to go and do all those things for you

444
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:09,049
especially if you're in security

445
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:13,459
operations and you still manually

446
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:15,889
implementing your security controls you

447
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:16,730
you'll be called a roadblock that's

448
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:18,110
probably not

449
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:20,299
time that we've been called a roadblock

450
00:25:18,110 --> 00:25:21,889
not gonna be the last time either but

451
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:30,520
that the pressure gonna get to you

452
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:31,910
anyway so reality check number two so a

453
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:35,059
wife

454
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:37,280
generally is not an easy control to

455
00:25:35,059 --> 00:25:41,030
provision and maintain so you've seen

456
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:43,549
examples of signatures that could

457
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:47,178
generate false positives or even false

458
00:25:43,549 --> 00:25:50,000
negatives and for a wife to remain

459
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:53,840
relevant you have to maintain it and if

460
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:56,900
you fail to maintain it you would either

461
00:25:53,840 --> 00:26:00,260
lose your protection or you you would

462
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:04,040
stop the business or both which which is

463
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:06,890
not great and and of course there are

464
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:08,860
better tools available to us now after

465
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:13,100
maybe ten years of dealing with these

466
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:17,570
two to better tune them but it is still

467
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:22,668
a difficult piece of kids to maintain so

468
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:27,399
now get ready to panic so when we

469
00:26:22,669 --> 00:26:31,370
combine these two together you get this

470
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:34,309
and that's an abstraction of my face

471
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:37,399
when I first heard about outer border

472
00:26:34,309 --> 00:26:40,399
what the intention is to have laughs in

473
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:46,700
front of an API gateway we changes many

474
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:50,650
days many times in a day so you either

475
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:54,290
have to forfeit the security or just

476
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:57,230
crumble under the load which which you

477
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:59,090
would end up in in something like this

478
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:00,679
with an API it's just gonna be a

479
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:03,110
mushroom field because just they're

480
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:06,020
gonna spring them from everywhere and

481
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:09,100
you can't really control them in this is

482
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:09,100
a very disturbing thought

483
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:20,240
so there is a silver lining and when we

484
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:22,070
look at service-oriented architecture

485
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:26,990
and micro services and agile delivery

486
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:29,830
method with more of a positive lens we

487
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:33,409
can we can identify some some invaluable

488
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:36,470
opportunities so the first one is market

489
00:27:33,409 --> 00:27:39,379
services are modular and fine-grained

490
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:42,679
and that's that's what we like in

491
00:27:39,379 --> 00:27:45,199
security so as opposed to a monolithic

492
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:47,720
web app that that pretty much does

493
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:50,149
everything and it's very difficult to

494
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,830
understand it and for that reason it's

495
00:27:50,149 --> 00:27:54,559
it's hard to secure it

496
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:56,928
marker services are atomic so they're

497
00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:06,740
simpler to understand which which makes

498
00:27:56,929 --> 00:28:09,409
them theoretically easier to secure with

499
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:11,990
DevOps you we can communicate our

500
00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:15,049
security requirements earlier and as

501
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:18,940
they say as they said the shift shift

502
00:28:15,049 --> 00:28:22,668
the security to the left so you would

503
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:24,200
piece off your developers less so I'm

504
00:28:22,669 --> 00:28:27,529
coming from a software development

505
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:30,169
background for me the two the two things

506
00:28:27,529 --> 00:28:32,690
that I always hated was expectation

507
00:28:30,169 --> 00:28:35,899
without consultation and restricting

508
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:38,570
rules that gets in the way of your

509
00:28:35,899 --> 00:28:42,408
creativity or your experimentation and

510
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:47,230
we will see examples of this in this

511
00:28:42,409 --> 00:28:50,419
slide we also get a chance to bring

512
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:53,330
feedback from production environment

513
00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:56,600
where we are battling with threats and

514
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:59,750
real world issues and bring all of those

515
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:02,928
back into our lower environments which

516
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:08,179
means they're gonna be less surprises

517
00:29:02,929 --> 00:29:12,019
the next release cycle the next one that

518
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:15,590
can help us is we can use API specs or

519
00:29:12,019 --> 00:29:19,370
API blueprints so depending on the API

520
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:23,240
development framework things like open

521
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:25,040
API or Ram all or a theory so you can

522
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:28,370
use those to encapsulate

523
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:32,030
some key pieces of information for the

524
00:29:28,370 --> 00:29:34,340
security team so what was previously had

525
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:36,410
to be discovered when you wanted to do

526
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:38,360
wife onboarding anyway you had to look

527
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:40,790
at the traffic and find out Oh what is

528
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:44,899
this field and what type of data existed

529
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:49,460
it now what you can get the developers

530
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:51,680
to record it in a way that your machine

531
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:55,280
or your software can read so in in those

532
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:57,860
type of format well way back while

533
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:59,540
they're discussing the specification of

534
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:02,270
the API so we're talking about the

535
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:04,760
design phase and they have the data

536
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:06,200
provider and the API consumer in the

537
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:09,440
room so that's the time that you

538
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,510
actually identify those some example of

539
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,870
this could be as I mentioned the type of

540
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:18,320
data that you expect to see ye go to be

541
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:20,239
sent or received by the API or things

542
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:25,370
like HTTP methods so what do you expect

543
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:28,760
to see there so the extensibility of the

544
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:31,610
API development framework with a little

545
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:34,190
extra work from the developers early on

546
00:30:31,610 --> 00:30:37,040
in the process could help us bridge this

547
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:42,710
gap between development and security

548
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:44,899
teams and last one infrastructure is

549
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:45,470
called so there's there's nothing but

550
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,900
code

551
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:50,300
they'd the wife configuration and should

552
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:53,540
be part of the release that delivers the

553
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:56,629
product and nothing separate so and

554
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:59,149
while false positives are similar to

555
00:30:56,630 --> 00:31:02,780
software bugs you just discover them and

556
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:05,930
you doing testing and you debug them and

557
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:08,780
you do deal with them the same way that

558
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:10,610
you deal with your code this way you

559
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:14,750
you're essentially speaking a common

560
00:31:10,610 --> 00:31:17,719
language and and blend well in the

561
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:24,950
delivery so you security actually exists

562
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:27,650
in the CI CD pipeline now let's have a

563
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:32,830
look at how we build the wealth policy

564
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:35,840
for an API in an automatically deployed

565
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:38,570
so the policy constitutes of three main

566
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:42,020
components the first one is a template

567
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:44,629
for for base protection so you will keep

568
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:47,020
common settings across all your AP eyes

569
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:49,520
in this section so things such as

570
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:52,750
maximum header length let's say or

571
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:54,920
allowed characters in the header er

572
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:57,980
mandatory headers like you definitely

573
00:31:54,920 --> 00:32:01,610
want to see host names or you definitely

574
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:03,920
want to see a JWT token or how do you

575
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:05,360
want to deal with multiple encoding how

576
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:08,540
many rounds of encoding you wanna

577
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,850
enforce so all of those things just go

578
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:14,090
into this section you can also enable

579
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:18,350
some highly accurate signature

580
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:20,600
protection for the backend server so the

581
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:23,659
security team is responsible to develop

582
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:26,270
this it it doesn't need to change that

583
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:29,710
much or frequently but but it gets

584
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:33,430
reviewed and updated periodically and

585
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:37,370
how do we how do they need to provide it

586
00:32:33,430 --> 00:32:39,860
it has to be in a code format so in a

587
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:41,989
format that you can keep it in a source

588
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:44,719
repository you can use a text editor to

589
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:46,460
edit it or read it you can compare

590
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,580
different versions and if you need to

591
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:53,710
you should be able to merge it things

592
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:53,710
like JSON or Yammer will do really well

593
00:32:55,510 --> 00:33:01,460
the next part is the API specific

594
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:05,750
component so this is based on what the

595
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:08,420
API publishes in other metadata related

596
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:11,780
to the API for example if you decided to

597
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:14,600
enforce Donna validation based on the

598
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:17,420
content length or what characters are

599
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:19,959
allowed for the specific field you would

600
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:23,810
need the API developer to capture this

601
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:25,190
during the API design and when and but

602
00:33:23,810 --> 00:33:27,620
that's when they're talking to the data

603
00:33:25,190 --> 00:33:29,900
provider so they have access to those

604
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:36,260
sort of information and they were

605
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:38,200
recorded in the API spec or as I the

606
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:41,510
other examples that I already mentioned

607
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:45,140
HTTP method is it does it only support

608
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:47,450
get or put or delete you you'll know and

609
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:50,540
you have all of that in the API spec

610
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:52,630
documented way before it gets today to

611
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:57,379
the security

612
00:33:52,630 --> 00:34:00,019
or other other metadata for example does

613
00:33:57,380 --> 00:34:03,320
this API need to be geo-fenced or is

614
00:34:00,019 --> 00:34:05,210
this an internal only API these are

615
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,580
again sort of things that can be fleshed

616
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:10,060
out during the design phase and you can

617
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:13,520
have you can use the extensibility of

618
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:19,520
the API framework to documented inside

619
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:22,820
the API spec and the last step you

620
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:25,339
capture any manual changes that need to

621
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:27,200
be made to the graph configuration for

622
00:34:25,339 --> 00:34:30,139
example if you need to deal with a false

623
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:32,839
positive or if you got a feedback from

624
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:35,419
production that you had to do things or

625
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:37,790
make changes you want to collect all of

626
00:34:35,418 --> 00:34:42,040
that and make sure you just add it to

627
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:45,859
this mix so we we then end up with

628
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:49,099
consistent environments across dev and

629
00:34:45,859 --> 00:34:53,989
test and you Etienne SVT and pre prod

630
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:55,849
and prod again the security team

631
00:34:53,989 --> 00:35:02,390
provides this and they turn it into a

632
00:34:55,849 --> 00:35:04,520
code so eventually your configuration

633
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:07,390
builder just combines all of these three

634
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:12,950
components and just gives you the final

635
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:15,618
policy for that a specific API and there

636
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:17,720
will be a single JSON file did you keep

637
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:20,630
it in your source repository and that's

638
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:26,899
beside the rest of the code for dead API

639
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:29,599
version and then from there your

640
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:33,650
automation engine can can essentially go

641
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:36,589
and read that policy and translates it

642
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:38,599
into the laugh language and it can and

643
00:35:36,589 --> 00:35:41,119
this is again if you're using for

644
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:45,800
example ansible you could have modules

645
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:49,010
wrapper wrapping around the woth api

646
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:53,780
and then push this configuration for

647
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:55,700
that specific api to the wife -

648
00:35:53,780 --> 00:36:00,619
whichever environment that you're

649
00:35:55,700 --> 00:36:05,000
targeting so hopefully all of that made

650
00:36:00,619 --> 00:36:06,940
sense I would like to share again

651
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:11,000
a couple of more considerations yeah

652
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:13,790
first one is having a sign of process

653
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,510
for what is published as part of the API

654
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:21,080
design would be a good idea so this

655
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:25,630
ensures that the organization knows what

656
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:25,630
is exposed and why you're exposing that

657
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:34,250
so trading the wire false positives or

658
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:36,440
false negatives as software box they

659
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:39,140
record them track them debug them and

660
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:41,680
test them so you would ideally want to

661
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:44,240
have your automated testing tools or

662
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,640
dynamic or interactive application

663
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:49,580
security testing tools to create tickets

664
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,859
for example or bug reports for for their

665
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:57,650
findings so you can go and remediate

666
00:36:51,860 --> 00:37:01,850
them whether you keep the raf instance

667
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:07,340
in the development area in block mode or

668
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:09,650
in learning mode that is is a critical

669
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:15,320
choice but it's it's your call it's it's

670
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:18,370
an organization decision to do that I'm

671
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:21,020
just going to go through this quickly so

672
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:23,779
discuss your with with your API

673
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:27,620
development team upfront in the process

674
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:30,530
discuss how you want to arrange the API

675
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:33,290
URI path and the hierarchy for example

676
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:36,680
do you want to have namespaces a slash

677
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:38,779
platform slash version and then API and

678
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:43,640
the method so because it has to work for

679
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:44,840
both talk to your wife vendors and and

680
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,700
just make sure you know their

681
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,680
limitations that could be limitations

682
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:50,149
around the size of the policy or the

683
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:53,720
number of policies that you can push

684
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:56,300
through those devices and based on that

685
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:57,980
you need to have a scale out plan which

686
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:01,940
which we shouldn't you should have

687
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:04,460
needed on day one but usually if you

688
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:05,990
have it before you make your release in

689
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:09,290
the future you're gonna have less

690
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:14,270
trouble changing things around and last

691
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:17,270
one participate in every step so be in

692
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:18,940
the pipeline so for initial release for

693
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:23,470
subsequent maintenance really

694
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:28,119
and for decommission this is the last

695
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:30,009
slide so you know ask you to pay more

696
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:33,089
attention to this one if you've been

697
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:36,849
distracted with other stuff

698
00:38:33,089 --> 00:38:39,099
the first one is get your toolset ready

699
00:38:36,849 --> 00:38:40,750
so you research your automation tool and

700
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:43,390
other DevOps supporting tools you would

701
00:38:40,750 --> 00:38:46,299
rather use a tool that your organization

702
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:50,379
is already using rather than going out

703
00:38:46,299 --> 00:38:54,069
and bring yet another platform that

704
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:57,069
works in parallel so bare minimum you

705
00:38:54,069 --> 00:38:59,740
would need an issue tracking system a

706
00:38:57,069 --> 00:39:05,440
source code repository and obviously an

707
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:07,779
automation orchestration to talk to your

708
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,450
vendors so ask them for development

709
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:12,460
temporary or consumption based licenses

710
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:16,118
they could that could save you a lot of

711
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:19,900
money especially in a multi environment

712
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:22,599
deployment also ask them to review your

713
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:25,210
architecture review your code and and

714
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:31,299
assist you with their products API that

715
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:34,210
can save you a lot of time we've bashed

716
00:39:31,299 --> 00:39:36,910
this death so but I can't emphasis on

717
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:42,549
this enough test it over and over and

718
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:44,348
test it again and the last one integrate

719
00:39:42,549 --> 00:39:47,529
with your change management system

720
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:50,710
educate and speak to your change

721
00:39:47,529 --> 00:39:53,049
advisory board members you need to be

722
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:55,630
able to provide visibility to the rest

723
00:39:53,049 --> 00:39:58,299
of the IT and the business and feel them

724
00:39:55,630 --> 00:40:02,799
with confidence that you have your

725
00:39:58,299 --> 00:40:04,750
checks and balances in place that's the

726
00:40:02,799 --> 00:40:08,069
end of the presentation if there are any

727
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:08,069
questions happy to answer

728
00:40:11,729 --> 00:40:15,098
we may have time for one quick question

729
00:40:14,049 --> 00:40:16,450
while we set up for the next

730
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:22,269
