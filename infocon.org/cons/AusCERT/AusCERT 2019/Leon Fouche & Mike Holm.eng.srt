1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,880
please welcome when I can Leon morning

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:11,219
everyone I'll try to keep your time I

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,799
know we've got lunch afterwards so I'll

4
00:00:11,219 --> 00:00:15,149
try to get us out of time so this is

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,060
actually the third year that we've done

6
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:21,539
the survey and when we sort of looked at

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,640
this doing a survey for Australia was we

8
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:27,000
wanted to look at getting some good data

9
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,080
relevant to to our country because

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,730
there's a lot of other surveys that's

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,430
done but pretends sort of focused more

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,620
on the top in of town so what we're

13
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,800
going to present here is the results

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,989
from last year's survey that we've done

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,410
we ran it from I think it was September

16
00:00:39,989 --> 00:00:45,390
up till November and we had about just

17
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:46,949
over 500 responses coming back which i

18
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,860
think was actually quite a good response

19
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:52,289
rate and we we sort of targeted

20
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:55,110
organizations that's on the lower end

21
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:58,109
there's not sort of top in enterprises

22
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,730
so sort of sort of below the ten million

23
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:01,739
or ten billion dollars annual turnover

24
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:05,489
for a corporate a lot of responses from

25
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:07,830
government entities education sector so

26
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:11,220
what I want to talk through is I think

27
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:15,810
it's important to look at how the global

28
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,890
risk landscape has changed and just a

29
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,439
bit of learnings that I want to take

30
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,170
away from from that and there's a theme

31
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,789
we've sort of carried into looking at

32
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:25,650
the World Economic Forum which is the

33
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,810
the analysis that we've taken there from

34
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:29,579
a global perspective and they say what's

35
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:32,250
the what do we see in the survey results

36
00:01:29,579 --> 00:01:35,220
in the Australian threat landscape and

37
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,710
then we have seen a lot of increases in

38
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,890
security spent so what is the impacts

39
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:43,649
that came from that we also seen some

40
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,329
legislative changes so the manner to

41
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:48,750
data breach notification came to effect

42
00:01:45,329 --> 00:01:52,079
last year GDP is in place so how did

43
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:54,090
that impact changes in behaviour coming

44
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,979
through the survey and then we'll just

45
00:01:54,090 --> 00:02:01,079
have some final thoughts at the end so

46
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:04,020
as I mentioned the World Economic Forum

47
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,270
on a annual basis publish a report which

48
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,299
talked about risks going to impact the

49
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,978
global economy and over the last number

50
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:15,020
of years we're seeing cyber security

51
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:17,910
data breaches really going up

52
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:19,350
over the years what we now see is from

53
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:23,640
an impact pose or a likelihood

54
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:25,980
perspective a cyberattack and data

55
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,929
breaches is within the top 5 of

56
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,679
likelihood and if you look at what's

57
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:33,600
sitting around that is societal

58
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,640
environmental issues so it's quite

59
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,530
difficult to address those likelihood

60
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:41,459
so if cyber security is sitting there

61
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:42,720
are we losing the battle so are we doing

62
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:44,400
enough to actually reduce the likelihood

63
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,710
and if you look at some of the

64
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,140
strategies put in place for some of

65
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:50,520
those other risks it's not about

66
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,809
reducing the likelihood I think it's

67
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,730
just the impact that's been looked at

68
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,040
but actually there's a lot of work been

69
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,899
putting into what's the how do you

70
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:03,329
address the impact of the consequence

71
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:06,300
for that so just to start off looking at

72
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,970
where we where some of the soft security

73
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:12,450
inserts came from so what we have there

74
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:14,070
is the trains over the last three years

75
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:16,950
and actually the trend line or the line

76
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:18,239
days is what what actually the response

77
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:20,310
is saying they expect it in they're

78
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,620
coming here and to me what is actually

79
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:24,390
quite interesting is to see that I think

80
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,209
we underestimate the effect of cyber

81
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:29,040
criminals and if you look at there's a

82
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:32,160
lot of that happening I mean over 60%

83
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,829
still off off it's extra light to cyber

84
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,380
criminals for me the interesting part

85
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:40,890
there is is sort of an increase over

86
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:43,320
time on on third party hosting providers

87
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,940
attacks happening there or data breaches

88
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:47,310
happening there and if you look at a

89
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:51,450
concerns going forward there's an

90
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:53,130
increased concern around that so if you

91
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:55,518
look at just take a look at the

92
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:57,810
incidence that that was experienced so

93
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,480
what we've got these on the left-hand

94
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:03,900
side of that that graph is showing what

95
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,780
attacks actually took place last year I

96
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,640
put at LAN over there to say the

97
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:10,200
question we asked a year before that is

98
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,420
to say well what was the expected

99
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,820
attacks going to come from and in the no

100
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:16,858
right hand side is where do we expect

101
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:19,500
attacks to come from in the future and

102
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:24,359
for me the interesting one that keeps

103
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:27,090
coming up is fishing these it wasn't a

104
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,780
concern if you look at how increase of

105
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,760
that is coming

106
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,979
minutes almost double than what was

107
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:34,500
expected to happen and if you look at

108
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:36,180
Stoke looking in the future where the

109
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,580
expected attacks going to come from

110
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,050
that's still fairly low what is

111
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,960
interesting is the concern around data

112
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,280
theft data loss I mean that's really out

113
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,280
of whack if you look at the right hand

114
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,150
side of where that's coming from I don't

115
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,099
know Mike if you've got some

116
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:52,099
observations around what but also seen

117
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:19,659
I think I've got a dead battery sorry

118
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:30,500
writer let's try that not right in front

119
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,639
of a speaker so one one interesting

120
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,950
thing that we did see though was that

121
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:36,889
ransomware actually tape it off a little

122
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:38,389
bit this time so we obviously we were

123
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:39,919
getting a lot of incidents coming

124
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:41,150
through from our members saying rain

125
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,440
somewhere rain somewhere in somewhere

126
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:44,810
and then it just seemed to taper off a

127
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,940
little bit over the last probably twelve

128
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:48,530
months or so interestingly though

129
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:50,270
there's still actually a lot of people

130
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:51,650
thinking that that is something that

131
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,250
they need to worry about and that's a

132
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:55,219
good thing

133
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,570
so our deduction from that was people

134
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:58,729
have probably increased their controls

135
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:00,050
that was the only logical reason for it

136
00:05:58,729 --> 00:06:02,150
because there's still ransomware out

137
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,650
there we still see a lot of malware that

138
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,719
we're ripping apart and finding

139
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:09,679
obviously is a ransomware variant of

140
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:12,350
some kind so I guess that the takeaway

141
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,700
from this is to actually have processes

142
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,310
and procedures in place to deal with

143
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:17,930
those common incidents and those of you

144
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:21,950
that have done that you've seen a

145
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:23,510
drop-off in those incidents thanks Mike

146
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:24,979
what are your thoughts around why

147
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:26,990
there's a sort of also difference

148
00:06:24,979 --> 00:06:29,300
between what is experienced from an

149
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:30,919
unauthorized external access and if you

150
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,990
look at the concerns a year ago erased

151
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:36,020
it's sort of the same magnitude if

152
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:37,430
you're looking forward we think we're

153
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,310
concern about who's got access to our

154
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:41,900
systems I mean it's a stat that I at

155
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,710
this stage we can't really explain why

156
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,710
there's a difference day

157
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:57,820
no it's actually it's well we don't see

158
00:06:54,610 --> 00:07:00,340
as many yeah well it's probably fear is

159
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:03,550
what's coming through so if you look at

160
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:05,380
just a data breaches specifically we've

161
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:08,830
seen a 79 percent increase from previous

162
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:12,730
years around data breaches and that's

163
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:15,460
that's a concern that we hopes not going

164
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:16,810
to carry into the into the future if you

165
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:19,330
look at the top of information that's

166
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:23,050
that's typically breached these contact

167
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:27,010
information and even look at identity

168
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:28,990
theft is it's over a quarter off so over

169
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:33,159
25% of that actually can relate directly

170
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:34,630
to identity theft and financial

171
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:36,700
information what is quite interesting is

172
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:39,310
that there's only ten percent of the top

173
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:41,530
information that's that's breached and

174
00:07:39,310 --> 00:07:45,120
again I have to preface that we looked

175
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:50,200
at a population that's not in the top

176
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:52,210
sort of quartile off of industry now if

177
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,440
you look at the impacts and again this

178
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:55,479
is some interesting information that

179
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:58,160
when I first looked at this that came

180
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,280
through is we've seen a reduction in

181
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,170
[Music]

182
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,799
impacts around lost to access for less

183
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:08,170
than a day recovery exercise required

184
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:10,750
but what there's an increase in

185
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:12,490
notification yes we expected that to be

186
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:15,520
the case because in previous years it

187
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:18,610
wasn't required to notify and the last a

188
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:21,460
report cycle mandatory data breach

189
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:24,130
notification was actually in place and

190
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:26,099
then things like employee records I mean

191
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:29,590
there's there's been increasing that

192
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:31,540
customer records but I think the other

193
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:35,079
one is brand and reputation or damage so

194
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:38,350
I think we have anyone from a media here

195
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:41,250
in the room I think we've got an enemy

196
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,250
in the media

197
00:08:42,219 --> 00:08:46,759
around how bad cyber is and I think

198
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,370
that's the brand of reputation or

199
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:51,259
damaged part so I think that's something

200
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:54,560
that it comes back to how do you control

201
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:57,290
that risk and the impact what they're

202
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,119
likely to that going to be run with it

203
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:00,769
is actually what is the I mean what are

204
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,370
you pretty to put in place to reduce the

205
00:09:00,769 --> 00:09:06,560
the impact they're off I don't know Mike

206
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,060
any thoughts on on what you've seen

207
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,089
coming through and the responses you did

208
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,739
um yes we one of the things that we've

209
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:14,810
noticed when we're talking to our

210
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,699
members at the moment is the increased

211
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:20,060
awareness further up the stack and that

212
00:09:16,699 --> 00:09:22,969
was actually by stack I mean management

213
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:25,609
layers so CISOs or size o--'s depending

214
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:27,290
on which university you went to and that

215
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:29,209
I think was also reflected in the survey

216
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:31,399
that there is actually awareness up at

217
00:09:29,209 --> 00:09:33,199
that high levels now now what that means

218
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:34,850
is the higher levels of management are

219
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:37,040
then pushing further down and saying

220
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,410
have you got an incident plan for this

221
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,750
can we do a tabletop exercise on some of

222
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:43,459
these things and actually try try out

223
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:45,230
some of the of the plans you've got in

224
00:09:43,459 --> 00:09:48,018
place so what we're seeing with our

225
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:51,019
members is the ones that actually have a

226
00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:55,189
well tried tested incident response plan

227
00:09:51,019 --> 00:09:56,810
and by well tried and tested the

228
00:09:55,189 --> 00:09:58,610
incident response plan I can probably

229
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:00,739
count on the fingers of one hand the

230
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:02,959
number of people that actually have all

231
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:04,910
of those things ticked those are the

232
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,768
ones that have the reduced impact and

233
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,939
you know maybe if I have a ransomware

234
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:10,759
attack it might only take them a couple

235
00:10:07,939 --> 00:10:12,050
of hours to recover those that don't

236
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:17,120
have any of those three things ticked

237
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:17,630
off it'll be days weeks whatever thanks

238
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,089
Mike

239
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:22,939
so now let's look at what's the impact

240
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:25,550
on the increased security investments so

241
00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:27,410
I think the first thing is what we're

242
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,849
showing there is and and it is a bit of

243
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:33,680
a busy slide but I think we need to look

244
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:36,410
at at it in that way what we have on

245
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:40,638
there is basically specific security

246
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:43,160
controls that we looked at and and how

247
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:47,449
that sort of improved over time and if

248
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:50,300
you look at on average less than 50 to

249
00:10:47,449 --> 00:10:53,420
60 percent of governance related

250
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:55,189
security controls has been matured and

251
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,930
has been implemented I know there's a

252
00:10:55,189 --> 00:10:57,550
lot of work

253
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:59,469
have been done in industry around so

254
00:10:57,550 --> 00:11:02,079
getting the information security

255
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:04,390
management systems in place to sort of

256
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:07,210
help with that for me the interesting

257
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:08,670
part also coming out of that is if you

258
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:11,890
look at this a concern around

259
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:13,689
unauthorized access external parties

260
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:16,800
accessing the environment if you look at

261
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:19,330
the level of maturity around having

262
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,189
cloud security standards third party

263
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:23,080
security standards in place I'm doing

264
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:26,350
third party risk assessments that's

265
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:30,190
fairly low from maturity perspective and

266
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:31,750
then this morning we had a discussion a

267
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,430
presentation on a sigh so you could see

268
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:36,520
how low that maturity level is there

269
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:38,439
overall so I think that's definitely a

270
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,149
career progression for those that of us

271
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,399
going through our career I mean there's

272
00:11:40,149 --> 00:11:45,399
definitely need for that so I think

273
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:47,800
overall we have seen an increase in in

274
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:50,470
the governance related to cyber security

275
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:53,380
but I think the visibility around the

276
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,970
risk in outside of the organization in

277
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:59,070
your cloud providers in your third-party

278
00:11:54,970 --> 00:12:03,400
providers that seems to be fairly low

279
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:05,620
then looking at prevention so that's

280
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:07,270
more about the likelihood and again not

281
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,190
all of those controls relate to to

282
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:13,230
prevention but for me the interesting

283
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:16,180
thing there is phishing sorry antivirus

284
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:18,850
malware protection content filtering to

285
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:21,819
block out bad emails that's four of the

286
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:23,380
most mature security controls that's

287
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:26,470
implemented but if you look at fishing

288
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:28,000
still coming through so I think the

289
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:31,029
investment in those security controls

290
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,100
not sure that's working and I think the

291
00:12:31,029 --> 00:12:34,510
presentation this morning I think that

292
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,980
was sort of echo as well is there need

293
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:38,980
to be a shift around stopping bullying

294
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,709
high walls and start thinking about what

295
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:44,170
you need to do once it's in the network

296
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:46,089
Microsoft thoughts on your side is one

297
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:48,430
of the biggest problems that we see is

298
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:51,670
that implementing a technical control is

299
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:53,380
is difficult if you have the maturity to

300
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,689
to implement something like antivirus

301
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:57,060
well everyone's got that mint level of

302
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,400
maturity we've got that down pat

303
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:01,349
if you've got the level of maturity to

304
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,870
take for example something that comes

305
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:06,660
out of a highly concentrated feed of

306
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:09,630
indicators of compromise that says here

307
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:11,640
is a hash of a binary now go forth and

308
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:13,890
search for that in your environment be

309
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,750
it your content filters or your seam or

310
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:17,310
whatever to actually find out did this

311
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,260
come into your environment is it coming

312
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:21,119
into your environment has it executed on

313
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,280
your desktops that sort of thing that

314
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,830
level of maturity we're seeing is is

315
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:28,350
very low so it's almost a little bit

316
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:30,570
depressing in that we have a bunch of

317
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:33,720
really good information that we try to

318
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:35,340
get out to our members and I guess the

319
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:37,260
the uptake of it is not as quick as

320
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:40,350
we've hoped for so we've had to sort of

321
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:41,850
adjust our thinking into well hang on

322
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:43,410
maybe we need to actually help our

323
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:46,440
members implement some of these

324
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:48,449
technical controls that seems to be the

325
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,760
difficulty similarly with cloud

326
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:53,220
technologies now every time someone

327
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:56,220
looks at I don't know email filtering in

328
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:57,390
the cloud or web browsing corporate web

329
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:59,670
browsing system through the cloud

330
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:02,280
there's limited ways that you can

331
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:04,410
actually use that to detect what's going

332
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:07,110
on you've got to trust their threat

333
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:09,089
intelligence so a vendor XYZ will be

334
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:10,800
doing their filtering with their you

335
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:13,140
know antivirus their whatever and

336
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:15,270
there's no way to input someone else's

337
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:17,400
intelligence like for example the a CSC

338
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:18,930
or one of our feeds so one of the things

339
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,540
that we're trying to do is we're trying

340
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:23,520
to get all our lovely sponsor friends

341
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,569
out here to understand that the

342
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,210
government has threat intelligence

343
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:28,530
assets got threat intelligence and just

344
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,750
about anyone else might have it as well

345
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:32,069
and getting that into some of the

346
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:34,800
technical controls that you're already

347
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:37,890
able to use that's the future in my

348
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,870
opinion so I think the interesting thing

349
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:42,660
I mentioned before we look at the

350
00:14:39,870 --> 00:14:47,330
governance maturity levels it's sort of

351
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:49,589
sitting on the lower end of 50 these

352
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,970
controls are sort of around how do you

353
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:53,220
reduce the likelihood of something

354
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:54,270
happening the material that tend to be

355
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:59,340
on the high end

356
00:14:54,270 --> 00:15:00,810
70% side so now if you look at response

357
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:03,330
which is really about how do you reduce

358
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:05,640
an impact when something has gone wrong

359
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:08,100
when and if you look at that's about

360
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:10,420
detection so Security Operations Center

361
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,510
capability is still fairly low

362
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:15,790
having inserted response plan in place

363
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:18,000
has really improved over the years and

364
00:15:15,790 --> 00:15:20,439
actually having an instant response

365
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,870
standby capability to be able to respond

366
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,550
to that so really I think there's

367
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:26,440
probably where they need to be some

368
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:29,020
investment going into is is around

369
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:30,760
reducing that impact and I think if you

370
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,260
think back of that slide that I showed

371
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,360
rather than beginning around the World

372
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,490
Economic Forum and look at the risk

373
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,110
setting there cyber s sitting there it's

374
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:44,830
really about how do you reduce the the

375
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:46,990
impact on on on a cyber incident okay so

376
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:49,300
from a regulatory changes perspective so

377
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:51,720
as I mentioned mandatory data breach

378
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:55,540
notification came to effect last year

379
00:15:51,720 --> 00:16:00,990
for those of you has got operations in

380
00:15:55,540 --> 00:16:05,589
Europe GDP ours is also a requirement so

381
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:08,710
what we actually looked at the a year

382
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:10,840
ago we asked the question what is the

383
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:13,480
level of confidence for meeting that and

384
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:15,790
we actually seen quite a big step from

385
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:18,250
the first time I looked at it until we

386
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:21,280
actually asked it now again so there's

387
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:22,270
really been a good upliftment in in the

388
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,380
conference table to meet those

389
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:24,579
requirements which means that

390
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,160
organisations I've really started

391
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:29,920
investing in that but that actually had

392
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:32,860
some interesting trades if you look at

393
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,819
organisations that's quite to comply if

394
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:39,190
you start looking at some of those

395
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:41,380
controls again so if you look at the the

396
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:44,110
impact that's going to have is the green

397
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:47,439
bars they're showing if organisations

398
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:49,570
required to comply to data breach

399
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,820
notification so it didn't be not a

400
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:55,150
government organisation or if you

401
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:56,860
affiliates small organization the level

402
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:59,410
of a control maturity tend to be higher

403
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:02,110
then we're not required to comply with

404
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:03,790
that and to me that was that's actually

405
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:07,030
it shows there's behavior so there's a

406
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:08,829
compliance requirement there's a drive

407
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:11,199
to actually start investing in become

408
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:13,060
compliant so I don't know if you've got

409
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,900
so many observations if you've got any

410
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:20,139
clients that you had to respond to that

411
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:23,030
as part of a data breach notification we

412
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:25,310
haven't had anything major recently

413
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:28,069
but what we have seen is is everyone is

414
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:30,770
now far more interested in should I

415
00:17:28,069 --> 00:17:34,040
report this and that that little shift

416
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:36,440
instead of I need to come you know stick

417
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:39,170
it under the carpet to is am i required

418
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,120
to report on this that's been a really

419
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:45,170
significant shift that's been obviously

420
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:47,750
driven by that legislation yeah I mean

421
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:49,910
we've also recently helped a number of

422
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,890
our our clients to respond to incidents

423
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:53,150
and what is quite interesting is I mean

424
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:56,870
we're not lawyers so we can't give legal

425
00:17:53,150 --> 00:18:00,380
advice but in in our view a number of

426
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:05,540
those instances actually was required to

427
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:07,430
report and they still the sort of an

428
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:09,740
appetite not to go and talk to a lawyer

429
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:11,900
and get advice because we'll be all

430
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,670
right so I think that's a concern going

431
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:17,000
forward and I think that's sort of

432
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:19,100
leading to the other interesting stats

433
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,070
that came through is similar we asked

434
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:23,480
around not a data breach notification

435
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:25,480
specific areas that had to be put in

436
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:27,620
place from a compliance perspective so

437
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,210
the first one is around bringing a

438
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:31,879
process in place to actually determine

439
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:33,650
whether you need to notify and the top

440
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,690
graph they're showing in the blue was at

441
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:37,880
the time how confident organizations was

442
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:40,160
at the time that they would comply with

443
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:41,540
that and then a year later basically

444
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,390
saying that that confidence levels has

445
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:47,030
gone up all the way but to me the

446
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,650
interesting part still coming up is yes

447
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:51,290
we got a data breach notification plan

448
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:52,910
but has that been tasted it

449
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:55,159
I mean I've been fortunate enough

450
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:58,130
sitting in number of operational roles

451
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:59,870
in in a sock and what you tend to leave

452
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:02,240
is across as you don't go look at your

453
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:04,219
plan you just do it as you always done

454
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,950
so I think that's the important part of

455
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,780
having a plan in place and I think

456
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:10,100
that's if you've got some thoughts on

457
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:14,960
some of training you're doing currently

458
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:16,399
around that what we're actually doing

459
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,010
we've done this for the Victorian

460
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,680
Government in particular and they look

461
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:24,620
to us for how do I actually write an

462
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:27,500
incident plan and the question evolved

463
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:30,229
from can I just have a template that I

464
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:32,000
can fill in the question then evolved

465
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:34,010
after we sort of led them through what

466
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,410
they're actually asking there

467
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:39,200
it led to war hang on no will actually

468
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:42,440
come on site and we'll do a day with you

469
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,390
and we'll we'll train you in what that

470
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,280
actually means there's no such thing as

471
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:47,750
a template that you just start from and

472
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,090
go right there's you're into the

473
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,620
incident plan done you have to

474
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:53,570
understand obviously the concepts behind

475
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:56,270
it and then translate that into your own

476
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:57,889
organization so that particular piece of

477
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:59,720
training was was actually at the request

478
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:02,000
of Victorian government at the time and

479
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,309
we've realized the value of it and we're

480
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,860
about to make that available to all our

481
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:08,629
members to bring our expertise in terms

482
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,260
of well this is what we think you should

483
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:11,090
do

484
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:13,100
using the NIST guidelines obviously we

485
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:17,360
don't just make this stuff up in order

486
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:19,790
to actually come up with a plan Thanks

487
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,610
so just some final thoughts on the

488
00:20:19,790 --> 00:20:24,649
survey itself so if you look at again

489
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:27,740
coming back to the point bringing it

490
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:30,370
back to reducing the impact so what we

491
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:32,510
did there was actually look at

492
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:35,629
organizations that put some effort into

493
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:39,080
planning in preparation what was the

494
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:42,080
impact that if there was a data breach

495
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:44,600
or a cybersecurity incident how prepared

496
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,159
how better prepared they were then those

497
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:49,760
that actually did not have that in place

498
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:53,929
and data recovery is the big one there

499
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:56,330
is that it's almost three no opposite or

500
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:59,210
three and half times more prepared to

501
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:01,070
actually respond to an incident because

502
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:02,059
of they've done a preparation work so

503
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,830
they know where the confidential

504
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:06,500
information is sitting they had a

505
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:08,780
register of that they exercised it so

506
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:13,070
least likely that that's going to impact

507
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:15,379
them access to systems and information

508
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:17,330
so it's losing that again that just

509
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,620
shows that is this what it's worth to

510
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:22,309
start actually putting some effort into

511
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:24,500
preparing for incident understanding

512
00:21:22,309 --> 00:21:27,320
where your critical information is know

513
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:30,140
where your service providers are know to

514
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,460
contact because it's quite often it's

515
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,710
not a breach plan in place but you're

516
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,960
relying on a third party system you know

517
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:38,179
the vendor is but this is after-hours

518
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:40,700
who do you contact so contact

519
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:43,580
information of a third party provider is

520
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:46,830
not in the plans any final thoughts from

521
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:48,330
your site Mike yes actually that for

522
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:50,250
are certain members one of the biggest

523
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:51,779
problems we have as we don't we don't

524
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:54,179
publish our contact number on our

525
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:56,279
website because it's members only so you

526
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:57,870
want to login to the website so the

527
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:59,940
biggest problems we found I think this

528
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:02,639
is common across a lot of security

529
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:04,769
suppliers is the proverbial hits the

530
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,510
overhead rotary cooling device and then

531
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:08,429
everyone sort of dives straight for the

532
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:11,760
phone book and they don't have the right

533
00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:14,010
numbers to call so one of the things we

534
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:15,870
say to everyone is just grab our

535
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:17,158
incident hotline number it's a 1-800

536
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:19,439
number you can put it in your phone and

537
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:21,269
make sure you've done the same for all

538
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,039
of your other suppliers like Leon just

539
00:22:21,269 --> 00:22:25,169
said that's probably that if you take

540
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:30,629
nothing else out of this just be

541
00:22:25,169 --> 00:22:31,919
prepared with those phone numbers okay I

542
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:35,159
think that's the end of our formal

543
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:37,760
presentations any questions feel free to

544
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:37,760
shoot

545
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:48,020
cheers Mike in slide 16 there was a

546
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:50,750
really interesting view of the

547
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:53,210
difference between the combination of

548
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:55,310
already implemented in 2017

549
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:57,470
coupled with planning to implement in

550
00:22:55,310 --> 00:23:00,590
the next 12 months compared with actual

551
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:02,000
implementation so I find this data

552
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:04,399
really interesting because for many of

553
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,980
the other categories my initial thoughts

554
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,750
are what did people say last year what

555
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,880
was their intention to adopt compared

556
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:12,230
with actual adoption this one's really

557
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,600
interesting because we can see for the

558
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:16,940
most part people did do what they said

559
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,340
they were going to do in relation to NDB

560
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:22,940
preparation but do you guys have a feel

561
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:25,429
for that comparison between intention

562
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:27,740
and adoption for other for other

563
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:29,990
controls as well yep so I mean that's an

564
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,500
example there probably should look at

565
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,780
that one

566
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:36,560
we have graphs like that that shows

567
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:39,350
similarly already adopted plans to be

568
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:42,470
adopted and don't know so we have those

569
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:44,810
statistics for the last three years and

570
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:46,730
and that's why we put those trend lines

571
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:50,990
and those are more the trend lines they

572
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:53,030
are already adopted I think with lastest

573
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,010
presentation actually did show where the

574
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:57,260
plan adoption was and how does it

575
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:58,790
compare with the actual but if you

576
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:04,220
interested we can share that that

577
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:06,700
information with you okay any other

578
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,700
questions

579
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:19,320
in that case everyone could thank Leon

580
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:24,099
and Mike um that'd be great and

581
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:24,099
[Applause]
