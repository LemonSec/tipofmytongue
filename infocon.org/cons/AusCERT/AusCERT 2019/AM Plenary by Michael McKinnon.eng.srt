1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,410
our next speaker as I think I'm Mike

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,120
from also it made clear it's just not

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,980
possible to put on a conference this big

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,080
this far-reaching this in depth without

5
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,059
tremendous support from sponsors so you

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,120
to say a few words on a very exciting

7
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:17,189
title the C ISO and the gun at slinger

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:26,039
from our platinum one sponsor PS and C

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:30,590
please welcome Michael McKinnon thank

10
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:34,950
you good morning so I need your help

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:38,129
chief information security officer it's

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,320
it's a very lengthy title and it has

13
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:42,660
this amazing acronym and I work with a

14
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,370
lot of sizes or CISOs depending on how

15
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,769
we pronounce it through the work we do

16
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,480
at pur hacking hack labs the curious

17
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:52,770
global and certitude which are our major

18
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,989
brands and I have this quandary how do

19
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,969
we pronounce it is it C so or is it sigh

20
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:58,949
so and I thought what better opportunity

21
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:01,260
than to get your help and let's do a

22
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,870
quick vote if you think it should be

23
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:07,110
pronounced C so can I see a show of

24
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:08,340
hands oh okay okay

25
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,130
and if you believe it should be

26
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,850
pronounced sigh so can you give me a

27
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:17,280
shot a sigh so wins excellent okay so I

28
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,220
think I've mostly been been saying so so

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,960
although I think I have been kind of

30
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:24,979
alternating now and then anyway so sigh

31
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,559
so it is C so sorry sigh so it is

32
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:29,880
alright so I was browsing my LinkedIn

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,009
feed which has kind of become like I

34
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,560
don't know the Facebook of our industry

35
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:36,570
in some ways and there was a really

36
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,009
amusing clip and some of you may have

37
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,600
already seen this but I want to apply it

38
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:42,320
and then let's have a discussion about

39
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,320
what we see

40
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:39,739
so so my reaction was very much the same

41
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:41,510
when I first saw this video and I kind

42
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:43,430
of couldn't stop watching it I had to

43
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:45,560
keep replaying it and replaying it and

44
00:02:43,430 --> 00:02:47,540
Andy and then all of these other things

45
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,130
started to occur to me about this video

46
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,350
and like first of all why am i laughing

47
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:54,079
like why am i laughing it at this

48
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:55,190
misfortune this incident and so what I

49
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,690
thought is we have a bit of fun and

50
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:58,640
actually kind of go through this and see

51
00:02:56,690 --> 00:03:00,170
if we can can have a discussion about

52
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:02,000
some of the points here because I think

53
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,440
there's a lot of relevance about our

54
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,070
industry that is contained in this

55
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:11,750
simple video so let's talk about the

56
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:13,280
dasai so clearly first of all the first

57
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:16,130
observation is we see this guy has a

58
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,290
target painted on his chest and that's

59
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,690
not unlike a real sigh so is it in some

60
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:23,510
regards right and I want to clarify too

61
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:25,340
that when we talk about this role of the

62
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:27,230
chief information security officer in

63
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:30,170
some organizations they haven't formally

64
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:32,420
recognized that role there's no sigh so

65
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:34,790
as such but what I would suggest to you

66
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,738
is that the target is on someone in

67
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:39,350
every organization whether they know it

68
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:41,720
or not the default sigh so if you like

69
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:43,700
so as I'm talking about this role and

70
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,810
the sigh so have a think about people in

71
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,578
your organization who this might

72
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:49,070
actually apply to even though you might

73
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:50,930
not formally recognize that that as a

74
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:53,660
role and then I started to think well

75
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:56,000
hang on why did he get shot in the leg

76
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:59,540
like what could we think about with the

77
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,519
sigh so about why this happened to to

78
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,349
him and then I thought well there's a

79
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,230
few different scenarios here and

80
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:08,209
the first thing is if we believe kind of

81
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:10,219
as a metaphor that the sigh so getting

82
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:12,500
shot in the leg is more about the

83
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:15,170
organization or the enterprise suffering

84
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,298
some kind of of mishap then it's a bit

85
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:19,009
of a bit of an unfair representation to

86
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:21,048
put it all on on the sigh so and

87
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:24,139
typically we see sigh those who have a

88
00:04:21,048 --> 00:04:26,090
team of people working with them to help

89
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:29,570
protect the enterprise don't win and

90
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:32,448
those team could consist of of permanent

91
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:36,289
staff it could consist of contractors

92
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:38,150
and outsource providers could also

93
00:04:36,289 --> 00:04:40,940
consist of vendors in often ahah the

94
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:44,150
vendor may be the vendor who provided

95
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,800
the bulletproof vest kind of failed to

96
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:50,060
disclose the fact that the protection

97
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:51,949
stops about here or here or here or here

98
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,330
right they haven't kind of fully

99
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:55,699
disguised so maybe that's one scenario

100
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:57,889
the other the other scenario that's

101
00:04:55,699 --> 00:05:01,639
interesting is what I refer to as the

102
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:04,759
sigh so of overwhelm you know the job

103
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:08,659
ads right wanted chief information

104
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:11,000
security officer must have 80 years of

105
00:05:08,659 --> 00:05:14,389
strategic security management experience

106
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:17,810
and manage networks and firewalls

107
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:21,039
and have certifications in penetration

108
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:23,900
testing so these pore sizes are

109
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,990
overwhelmed and under-resourced and

110
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:29,330
they're going to get shot in the leg

111
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:33,919
often this is a problem for them then

112
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:36,650
we've got another type of size so that I

113
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,830
like to call the deputized Sai so and we

114
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:41,210
work with some organizations that really

115
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,159
are sort of getting to a point in their

116
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:45,080
security journey where they've realized

117
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:46,820
that they need a size o but they don't

118
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:49,070
go out and hire one they just sort of

119
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:51,949
deputize you know well Bob's been here a

120
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:54,530
long time let's make him this ISO and so

121
00:05:51,949 --> 00:05:56,120
Paul Bob he is just coming in has no

122
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:58,969
background perhaps in IT it's very

123
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,289
business focused very good at governance

124
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:03,110
and compliance but doesn't really

125
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:05,690
appreciate the technical aspects and the

126
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:07,310
metaphor for this situation is that

127
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,219
Bob's getting shot in a league he

128
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:13,599
doesn't even know he has because he has

129
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:16,250
no visibility over over the situation

130
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:17,599
let's turn our focus now then to the

131
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:20,030
penetration

132
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:22,820
the technical wizard who's going to

133
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:24,979
discover the the exposure here of the of

134
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:27,560
the of the leg that the sizer is not

135
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:30,890
aware of and my first question here is

136
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:33,950
well this guy look like a penetration

137
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,870
tester to you we have a bit of a

138
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:39,200
stereotype of penetration testers don't

139
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:42,800
we the hoodie to type the the teenager

140
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,510
in the basement if you will so you know

141
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,850
there's some interesting dynamics around

142
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:48,020
what that stereotype can potentially do

143
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,340
and if we're going back and we talk

144
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,859
about those sites those who may have

145
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:54,560
missed the information whether it be

146
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:57,470
technical guidance have they listened to

147
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,380
the technical guidance provided by these

148
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:03,350
experts and is that stereotype holding

149
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:07,219
us back the other interesting thing

150
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:09,650
about this is when the penetration

151
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:12,350
tester or this guy in the Vino pulls the

152
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:14,299
trigger now I showed this video to a

153
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:17,060
whole bunch of people without the

154
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:19,070
context of Saizo and penetration tester

155
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:21,230
so they just saw that the sketch it's on

156
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:24,920
YouTube it obviously doesn't have those

157
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:26,570
labels on it that context and the people

158
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:29,360
who saw the video that way said to me oh

159
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:31,640
this is an accident this guy has pulled

160
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,450
the trigger but he's not looking right

161
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,919
he doesn't know what he's actually doing

162
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:38,860
then I then when I show people the video

163
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:42,320
with the context of sighs oh and

164
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:44,030
penetration tester they all say oh you

165
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,820
know no he knew what he was doing is

166
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:49,039
this deliberate so this is an

167
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,510
interesting point about how we think

168
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:53,060
about penetration testers that

169
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:55,880
everything they do is deliberate but the

170
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:58,160
fascinating thing about pen testing is

171
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,900
and yes there's methodologies that are

172
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,820
followed and and there's and this is all

173
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:03,710
this nice stuff the way it works but

174
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:05,060
there are absolutely vulnerabilities

175
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:07,250
that are discovered completely

176
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,930
accidentally sometimes and so it's just

177
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:11,090
the the the art of getting the

178
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:12,980
penetration tester in to do the testing

179
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,880
that is that may result in this even

180
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:17,780
though it's accidental

181
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:22,100
so accidental or not you still learn

182
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:24,169
some lessons along the way and then it

183
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,870
brings me to what I think is the most

184
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:29,040
provocative part of what's going on here

185
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:31,940
and this is the fact that the

186
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:33,270
so is standing there saying come on

187
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:36,270
shoot me

188
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:38,299
I'm secure it's this it's this false

189
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:41,130
sense of security that the cipher has

190
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:44,520
that he's nothing bad is going to happen

191
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:46,530
and we see this all the time we see

192
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:49,260
vendors we see organizations sometimes

193
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:51,510
make claims like we have invented an

194
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:53,220
unhackable product we've got an

195
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:56,250
unhackable Network it's this

196
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:59,130
overconfidence that that plays out but

197
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:02,250
it's playing out also in much more

198
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:04,290
subtle ways where some people have this

199
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:06,150
notion and this this sort of I guess

200
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:07,560
this beginners kind of notion when you

201
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:10,020
when you start to look at security that

202
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:11,910
somehow security should be absolute and

203
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,860
so there's this subtle problem that

204
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:16,770
happens across boardrooms all over this

205
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:18,570
country where the size of the story the

206
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:21,449
see so sorry at this I said it right the

207
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:23,970
first time this the size so we'll be

208
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:27,030
presenting to the board and the director

209
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:32,550
leans over the table and asks this

210
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:34,040
question are we secure are we secure now

211
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:36,810
if you're a parent and you've got

212
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:38,939
particularly teenagers you'll know that

213
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:41,880
asking a question that's only going to

214
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:42,540
warrant a yes or no answer is a very bad

215
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,750
idea

216
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,880
so we need to stop asking the question

217
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:50,220
are we secure because it has this

218
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,780
inbuilt notion that security is an

219
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,390
absolute and we know that security is

220
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:57,030
not an absolute so the questions need to

221
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:59,310
get better from the highest levels and

222
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:01,740
if you can start asking questions like

223
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:03,689
how secure are we and recognize that

224
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,160
your security posture falls onto a

225
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:07,260
spectrum which a lot of us know is

226
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:11,130
industry professionals but some people

227
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:16,230
are still getting used to then you know

228
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:17,640
that's that's a real issue there's a

229
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:20,420
mobile phone or something going on there

230
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,420
in the background

231
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,590
so if we ask these better questions one

232
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:35,230
of the fascinating things that can

233
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:36,520
happen is this communication ripple that

234
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:38,140
can happen a sort of a communication

235
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,270
ripple of inquiry that can happen from

236
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:42,610
the boardroom all the way down through

237
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:46,140
to the basement so it can really change

238
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:49,630
the dynamic of of how we do security and

239
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:53,140
then as we get near the end here I want

240
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:55,150
to talk about this main point here which

241
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:56,949
i think is really sorely missed and the

242
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:58,780
fact we laugh at this guy's misfortune

243
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:00,700
we laugh at this ISOs misfortunate had

244
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:02,650
been shot in the leg but he's the one

245
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,960
who actually handed the weapon to the

246
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:07,090
penetration tester and so in our

247
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:10,690
industry and particularly in the theme

248
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:13,450
of of don't go it alone there is this

249
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:16,450
partnership that happens and thus ISO is

250
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:19,180
giving permission to the penetration

251
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:22,330
tester to be shot in the leg effectively

252
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,890
right so so and this is a wonderful

253
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:27,070
partnership it's a wonderful type of

254
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:28,800
engagement even though the site so in

255
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:32,440
this example is a little bit

256
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:38,910
overconfident about his security he

257
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:38,910
still ends up being shot in the leg so

258
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:45,040
there's really a couple of points I want

259
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:46,540
to leave in summary around here that

260
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,969
that I hope you've got from this video

261
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:51,400
and that's it that there is a target on

262
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:53,110
someone in your organization whether you

263
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,060
whether you know it or not make sure you

264
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:57,060
find who that person is and give them

265
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:59,469
all the resources and encourage that

266
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,089
encouragement they need to succeed and

267
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:05,200
the other one the other point too is

268
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:08,530
that if you're that person then make

269
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,690
sure you act on technical advice it's

270
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:12,069
always better even if you're you've come

271
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:13,420
from a background where you don't kind

272
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,400
of acknowledge and you're not interested

273
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:18,699
in technical opinion make sure you

274
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:21,400
really do you know have a spirit of

275
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:24,070
accepting it and working with it and

276
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:26,470
remember that security is never absolute

277
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:27,760
there's always this gradient and this

278
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,220
measure and we always want to work

279
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,860
towards improving it and remember one

280
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,540
thing that it's much better to get shot

281
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,990
in the leg than it is to get shot in the

282
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,939
head

283
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:40,870
at the end of the day

284
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:43,900
if as a sigh so you have got all of your

285
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:46,870
ducks in alignment and you've working

286
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:49,300
towards working with these partnerships

287
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:52,990
and you're not going it alone then

288
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:55,120
hopefully hopefully over time you'll end

289
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:59,260
up looking and your organization will

290
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:06,790
end up looking something like this thank

291
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:08,290
you very much yeah very much Mike

292
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,760
wonderful wonderful stuff we're gonna

293
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,990
give you a little gift mokou if you'd

294
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,520
like to come to stage as well we've got

295
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,050
a gift for your presentation we go back

296
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,430
on stage for a second just quickly we're

297
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,939
gonna give you a little gift as a thank

298

that we've done the gift thing before

301
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:23,290
we've often gave away our commemorative

302
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:25,060
coffee cup one year sample of Australian

303
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:26,680
wine one year did a cheese board one

304
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:28,599
year this year we've gone a little bit

305
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,660
nerdy quick sharp hands if you've done a

306
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:31,780
bit of The Legend of Zelda in your time

307
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,980
fantastic

308
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:34,900
quick show of hands if you think you're

309
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,730
a reasonable player of chess but if

310
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:43,120
you're chess place yeah great okay we'll

311
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:46,270
look at this The Legend of Zelda chess

312
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:48,960
set it doesn't get much bigger than that

313
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,960
Mikko

314
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:55,829
give them both the big round of applause

315
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,200
for getting us off and running in 2019

316
00:13:55,830 --> 00:14:00,839
The Legend of Zelda chess said thank you

317
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,550
very much gentlemen want to thank our

318
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,990
sponsors Pearson C on that occasion all

319
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:06,920
the other sponsors simply not possible

320
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:06,920
without your support
