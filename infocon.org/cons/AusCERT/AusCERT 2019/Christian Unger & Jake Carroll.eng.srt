1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,660
it is with great pleasure that I give

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:09,330
you two very dear friends of mine in

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:12,450
hunger and Jake Carroll doing this our

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:15,590
last presentation on strange things that

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:20,850
lurk in your supercomputer cloud I

6
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:29,810
exclude the parentheses finally I give

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:29,810
them up my boards guys good afternoon

8
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:35,370
so we're going to be talking about a

9
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,469
couple of different scenarios also scold

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,089
in particular for myself where we're

11
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:42,540
talking about lessons that we've learned

12
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,950
and some of the perceptions of the

13
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,989
technical staff versus the

14
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,200
organizational realities that bring us

15
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:51,570
towards the cloud and also the reality

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,050
is that the service delivery then goes

17
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:56,760
towards yeah so I guess the other side

18
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:58,890
of it which is my side is I'm going to

19
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,390
talk a little bit about in-house clouds

20
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:02,719
and some of the implications of them

21
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:04,949
freedom and control and security domain

22
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,619
industry-specific security posture in

23
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,939
the world that I come from I'm not a

24
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:11,400
security guy I'm not a security

25
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:13,619
researcher I work in supercomputing and

26
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,439
research computing this is a little bit

27
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:19,500
strange in that regard the performance

28
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,939
expectations around why we do the things

29
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,740
we do while we bend the rules with

30
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:24,360
security a little bit and some of the

31
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,530
other oddities which we come across and

32
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,179
I'm going to give you an example of

33
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:29,159
something strange that happen with a

34
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,530
supercomputer recently from a security

35
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,439
incident perspective that took us by

36
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,600
surprise and it's quite complicated so

37
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:38,399
if you fall off the stage it'll be fine

38
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,570
okay it'll be good they'll get a laugh

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,880
of it you need that in the afternoon

40
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,500
right all right we all know how IT

41
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,229
services are billed you can have good

42
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,030
cheap or fast and of course that assumes

43
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:50,220
that there's somebody there that's going

44
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:53,360
to build something good and you have

45
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:55,860
resources that can in theory be fast

46
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,070
broadly speaking cloud as a disrupter

47
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,930
and no surprises there but it changes

48
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:04,439
the traditional it isn't a drop-in

49
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:06,420
replacement every probably seen that

50
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:08,970
graphic I've seen on a few laptops

51
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:10,170
around the place so there is no cloud

52
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,720
there's only somebody else's computer

53
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:13,440
and with the move towards outsourcing

54
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,470
sort of

55
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,540
being concussed into the term cloud it's

56
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:20,070
also other people's stuff and comes in

57
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:21,810
three broad flavors you've got your

58
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,870
infrastructure service and platform as a

59
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:27,000
cloud not in that order but nevertheless

60
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:28,980
and they may be public/private hybrid

61
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,220
and then different vendors love

62
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,480
different coats of paint on there

63
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:35,010
according to Gartner you have greater

64
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,410
cost agility especially with

65
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,049
infrastructure as a cloud as a service

66
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:42,299
sorry you have increased retained cash

67
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:45,390
you have reduced opportunity cost

68
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,500
because you have more cash on hand but

69
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,149
on the con side you have higher

70
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,280
subscription fees for starters you have

71
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:52,110
subscription fees and especially with

72
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:54,300
software as a service you have decreased

73
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,060
cost agility and much greater switching

74
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:00,030
cost this may of course vary by your

75
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:01,590
organization so if your greenfield set

76
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,560
up it's going to be very different

77
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,610
experience than if you're an established

78
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,080
company organization with the

79
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:10,980
established service is moving to the

80
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:13,320
cloud and over the life of the client

81
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,679
presentation any decisions that you make

82
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:21,840
will feed back into your decisions etc

83
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:24,750
so it's it's a loop so avoiding the rant

84
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,600
about ITIL in value the conspiracy is

85
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:30,780
that you know companies are moving to

86
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:32,579
the cloud to save on staff but the

87
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,820
reality is that the vision is to reduce

88
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:38,190
risk exposure we've got we want to

89
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:40,890
reduce the complexity of maintaining

90
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:44,040
services and at the same time improve

91
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:46,829
the user experience by leveraging the

92
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,109
vendor expertise and their proximity to

93
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:51,959
service they can deliver better because

94
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,550
they're closer at the same time you want

95
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,650
to reduce cost in this something that

96
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:57,630
keeps coming up because you can just

97
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,239
turn off stuff you don't want to use

98
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:03,870
anymore but the reality of that is

99
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:07,820
probably a little bit different software

100
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:10,530
is a service platform and infrastructure

101
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:12,000
meet that vision in different ways so

102
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,430
you get your software which is just

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,048
software in the cloud platform as a

104
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:18,209
service it's a software plus a

105
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:22,530
specialist knowledge - the hardware new

106
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:24,650
data centers and IAS is just do it

107
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:26,479
yourself and off-site

108
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,500
and it comes with lots of toys that

109
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:32,930
don't necessarily make sense at the time

110
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:35,690
so you have reduced control or and less

111
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:38,810
transparency over your status usually I

112
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:41,780
find out from my user set office365 is

113
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:44,389
down or not logging in and then sometime

114
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:46,369
later Microsoft announces this too so we

115
00:04:44,389 --> 00:04:48,949
know they're right which we already knew

116
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,570
at that state dynamic scaling is complex

117
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:54,110
and it's potentially difficult to

118
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:57,460
validate and while you can save money

119
00:04:54,110 --> 00:05:01,940
you have to do it for the right services

120
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:04,400
you can reduce risk but any service

121
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:06,110
outage continues to be your problem it

122
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,840
doesn't matter what the cloud vendor

123
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:11,600
tells you and any breaches are also your

124
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,690
problem and at the same time you might

125
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,250
be introducing new risks and you

126
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,570
probably need to mitigate them and there

127
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:21,710
may be greater than what you had to

128
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:23,389
start with single vendor stacks so

129
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:27,109
platform as a service and software as a

130
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:28,880
service help with that setup but many of

131
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:31,039
the exclusions to your service delivery

132
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,530
are usually employed they're not up

133
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,409
front and center yes sort of discover

134
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:38,630
them your flexibility is impacted and

135
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:40,460
you introduce new constraints which may

136
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:42,200
be layer to you you usually constraint

137
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:45,260
to the vendor that you've just chosen by

138
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:48,200
30 of the definition and the support

139
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:51,169
center and time zones might be not

140
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,000
moving with the Sun and outage windows

141
00:05:51,169 --> 00:05:56,270
might be forced upon you based on where

142
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:58,610
they are based so then you user support

143
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:01,310
might suffer from that because they're

144
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:03,080
only available during UK times as with

145
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:03,520
experience or what you saw no not so

146
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,039
much

147
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,659
it's getting better and for

148
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,060
infrastructure in cloud hosted VMs

149
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:15,460
especially there are architecture

150
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:18,139
specific service and use cases that

151
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:20,270
changes a risk but they require

152
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:24,680
different skill sets so you may not have

153
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:27,710
the people on staff just yet and also

154
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,750
one one big thing that we found is the

155
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:33,789
risk reduction is sort of sold as a

156
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:35,800
feature but it raises your enterprise

157
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:38,440
multi vendors

158
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,210
become more interesting they've got all

159
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,509
the problems are just elaborated but

160
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:44,830
you've got multiple vendors and then you

161
00:06:43,509 --> 00:06:46,539
have gaps between the service

162
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:48,250
arrangements so who's doing the

163
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:50,680
operating system patching for an

164
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:52,599
infrastructure service who just clicked

165
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,419
the thing out of your food vendors are

166
00:06:52,599 --> 00:06:57,940
supporting your service and if you have

167
00:06:55,419 --> 00:07:00,130
reached who's gonna report that in

168
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:02,560
compliance with the local laws I mean if

169
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:03,729
you're here and that's not entirely true

170
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,949
because I've met some international

171
00:07:03,729 --> 00:07:08,830
people but if you hear order you're

172
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:15,069
subject to Australian laws so is your

173
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:17,050
cloud vendor so countering that

174
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:21,250
conspiracy from earlier about reducing

175
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:23,830
staff costs by getting rid of staff if

176
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,020
you have left and/or lower skilled staff

177
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,270
you have reengineered your services and

178
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:32,039
they're advertising your outage windows

179
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:34,508
was far too much detail which happens

180
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:37,960
and you had a - also known another

181
00:07:34,509 --> 00:07:40,389
organisation's platform then you're

182
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,370
increasing the attack surface your

183
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:45,449
susceptibility to social engineering and

184
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:48,759
service complexity in other words risk

185
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:50,259
generally speaking increasing risk is

186
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,900
not the strategic goal of any

187
00:07:50,259 --> 00:07:54,370
organization so the conspiracy really

188
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:58,870
doesn't hold up come on live a little

189
00:07:54,370 --> 00:08:01,240
it'll be fine all right cool so we're

190
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:04,090
going to kind of flip a little here and

191
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:07,240
change the gears you know the least

192
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:09,280
concerns about different mechanisms in

193
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:11,259
outsourcing capability and but in this

194
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,710
guy called a fog of technology war

195
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:17,050
there's some less obvious problems and I

196
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:19,750
kind of live those every day so

197
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:21,940
collectively and unintentionally you can

198
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:24,490
do a lot of harm with a really big

199
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:26,889
really big network pipe connected to a

200
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:30,699
supercomputer I happen to have one of

201
00:08:26,889 --> 00:08:32,890
those several in fact and my wonderful

202
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:35,829
organization has enabled me to do those

203
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:37,419
things but you know this kind of drifts

204
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:38,978
into that weird kind of territory where

205
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:40,598
I want to get to and that is the problem

206
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:42,700
with these in-house capabilities we have

207
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:44,920
and the attack surfaces which they

208
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,850
create and the risks which I create and

209
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,990
we're going to dig into that a little

210
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:47,970
bit because these problems are less

211
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,759
obvious

212
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:53,069
so you know we do those normal boring

213
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:55,500
things inside supercomputing we do the

214
00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:57,300
boring well you all know what AF is I

215
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:59,009
think but anyway yeah we do the boring

216
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,508
things you know we have our fail two

217
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:02,550
bands we use our port hardening

218
00:09:00,509 --> 00:09:04,980
mechanism as we firewall things we have

219
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,359
border edge default deny permissions you

220
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,689
know we containerize things with

221
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:11,220
singularity if we worry about them does

222
00:09:09,689 --> 00:09:14,730
anyone know what singularity is in the

223
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:16,980
room okay one person cool so think of it

224
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:19,560
like docker for grown-ups

225
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,290
so yeah see what I did there that was

226
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:25,258
that was intentionally gaming so yeah

227
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:26,849
it's log watch log analysis sweet music

228
00:09:25,259 --> 00:09:28,920
on trip wire and all that so all those

229
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,750
normal things that you would expect from

230
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:33,180
any shock doing anything in normal

231
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:35,269
security we do those things too but then

232
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:38,609
things get a little bit weird so

233
00:09:35,269 --> 00:09:42,209
supercomputing people are special and

234
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:43,620
sensitive we're an odd Bunch there's at

235
00:09:42,209 --> 00:09:46,979
least one individual in the room who

236
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:49,379
works in supercomputing like I do and he

237
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,970
knows what I mean so you know we have

238
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:52,589
all these codes and things and the way

239
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,540
our machines communicate with each other

240
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:56,459
are a little bit strange so much so the

241
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,649
fact that when our file systems talk

242
00:09:56,459 --> 00:10:00,930
between nodes were actually privileged

243
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:02,490
executing memory pieces between nodes

244
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:06,329
and processes if there are as running as

245
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:08,610
root okay we do strange things and to a

246
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:10,500
normal security person that's terrifying

247
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:12,389
you know it's a horrible thing what were

248
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,189
you thinking you people are monsters you

249
00:10:12,389 --> 00:10:16,410
know so just to see what it looks like

250
00:10:14,189 --> 00:10:17,759
this this is the summary of you know a

251
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:19,620
basic super truth you've got a massive

252
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:21,120
hundred gig pipe there you might have a

253
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,220
head node which is really nicely locked

254
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,769
down but then behind all that you've got

255
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:27,720
to leave cluster nodes which are 100 gig

256
00:10:25,769 --> 00:10:29,639
RDMA connected and they're sharing

257
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:31,439
memory in things all the time and

258
00:10:29,639 --> 00:10:32,850
processes as if they were running as

259
00:10:31,439 --> 00:10:34,410
root okay

260
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,930
privilege execution takes place in these

261
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:39,680
environments all the time that makes

262
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:42,149
people shake you know I've actually had

263
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,160
ordered type of people come to me and

264
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:45,809
say well how does this work is this even

265
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,980
okay how can you even get away with this

266
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:47,699
I'm like this is how a supercomputer

267
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:50,819
works

268
00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:53,219
so maybe unten ability of inspection is

269
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:55,378
and the an observation is an important

270
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,579
thing here so you know people will say

271
00:10:55,379 --> 00:10:57,870
oh you know you just need to look at

272
00:10:56,579 --> 00:10:59,609
things more careful or not quiet you

273
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:01,080
know people say won't somebody think of

274
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,820
the children

275
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:06,040
this aligns with the requirements of how

276
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,570
supercomputing works it's a function of

277
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,430
performance and the way we actually do

278
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:11,650
business and what we're looking for time

279
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:14,010
the discovery is what we care about not

280
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:15,790
keeping things locked out tightly okay

281
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,840
it doesn't mean we don't find

282
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:18,400
interesting things that happen

283
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:20,200
occasionally because we can't observe

284
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:23,829
certain things because of the speed we

285
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,810
work at think of multi Multi multi

286
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:28,330
terabytes of data flying at you every

287
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:30,579
second and then try and observe that

288
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:32,680
every second and analyze that every

289
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:35,830
second in some meaningful way this is

290
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,449
why it's hard okay so you know the

291
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:39,310
nature of the way things fly through our

292
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:40,570
networks looks very different to the way

293
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:43,260
they fly through you and it works as a

294
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:45,250
TCP stack things aren't the same okay

295
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:46,840
you know the problem with hundred gig

296
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:48,580
flow is of course as we're grappling

297
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,340
with in our organization at the moment

298
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:55,330
is actually keeping an eye on them it's

299
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:56,830
sort of hard okay so kind of moving

300
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:58,180
along the things you can think I'll get

301
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:00,790
into the crux of this and some of the

302
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:04,000
strange things we've seen happen I'll be

303
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:06,189
a little bit vague because I can't say

304
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,670
too much more vague than I am right

305
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:11,260
always I'm always very so does anyone

306
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:14,069
know what a generative adversarial

307
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:17,920
Network is does anyone heard of Ag an

308
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:19,240
awesome so one person that's awesome I

309
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,839
actually meant that thank you I'm glad

310
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:25,630
you know so wasn't being facetious so

311
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:27,340
this is a form of machine learning

312
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:30,460
technique that's currently being used

313
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:33,280
kind of at the top of the food chain for

314
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:34,870
a mechanism that's used for learning by

315
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,970
itself using unsupervised learning

316
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:38,890
techniques and there's a lot to that

317
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:41,470
which I won't unpack here but we've

318
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:43,600
actually seen this stuff in action so

319
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:46,210
this is what was known as a proposed

320
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:51,090
model of an idea scan right what does it

321
00:12:46,210 --> 00:12:56,920
mean in short people using mechanisms to

322
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:59,410
guess intrude damage and exploit using

323
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:01,089
machine learning techniques of a very

324
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,310
very complicated nature using generative

325
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:06,580
adversarial networks it effectively

326
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:09,609
means that you are not using supervised

327
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:12,100
labeling techniques in your AI or your

328
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:13,720
ml workload for things to guess so it is

329
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,250
no longer about brute force

330
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,020
it has become about the algorithm

331
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:18,940
learning by itself to get done what it

332
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:21,250
needs to get done okay and this stuff's

333
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:23,140
happening in real life now how do I know

334
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:27,100
we've seen it happen and yes the box is

335
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:28,900
supposed to be black so we found this

336
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,390
odd process on a log in node a little

337
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:34,449
awhile ago I've tried to get rid of

338
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:37,090
anything in the text which would harm

339
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:40,090
the innocent and stupid so this is

340
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:42,130
actually a process that was running 0nq

341
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:43,390
batch and we didn't know why is your own

342
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,040
key would be running on the head node

343
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:46,210
what was it transporting what was it

344
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,310
doing

345
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:50,440
turns out way down the bottom we could

346
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:53,170
actually see a private directory of an

347
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:54,820
anaconda three install a private Python

348
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:56,620
install in a home directory so what's

349
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,970
that doing there no one uses private

350
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:00,730
anaconda three on this system it's

351
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:01,750
preloaded we have it all in modules so

352
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:03,340
that was weird

353
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,330
when we started digging so what's the

354
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:06,310
deal with that this thing's got a

355
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:08,320
site-wide anaconda three why is it doing

356
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:10,030
that what's this person doing wait and

357
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:13,150
had a closer look oh look at that my old

358
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:14,949
friend Jupiter notebooks so what's the

359
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,660
Jupiter notebook doing why is it

360
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:17,350
launching like that what's it doing on

361
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,660
that port

362
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,370
well what's actually happening here so

363
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,410
we then dug a little bit more and if the

364
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:25,360
top output showed some strange things

365
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:27,819
something was ending up in Slovenia

366
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:31,000
somewhere why were things being sent to

367
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:32,800
Slovenia we wondered this alone is it

368
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,020
enough to kind of go this is really

369
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,609
weird running that much CPU time and

370
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,680
memory on a head node though is kind of

371
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:40,630
odd and why would it be communicating

372
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:43,569
with Slovenia when it is a organisation

373
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:44,650
or internal super which doesn't to the

374
00:14:43,570 --> 00:14:45,970
best of our knowledge have anything to

375
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,980
do with Slovenia so we started digging

376
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,060
and it got a little bit societal at that

377
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:51,820
point

378
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:53,140
keeping in mind again not a security

379
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,580
researcher just a person that has to

380
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:57,130
live and deal deal and breathe with

381
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:59,020
these things so what was the user

382
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:03,280
actually doing well it turns out again

383
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:04,720
was actually using looping mechanism to

384
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,819
take an increasingly educated set of

385
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,710
guesses targeting a financial

386
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:10,810
institution it was an IDs on the other

387
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:12,940
side of the world of a financial

388
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:15,040
institution the gans intentions were

389
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,810
hidden from view and they were obstacle

390
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,160
early inside that black box we couldn't

391
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:20,170
see that black box and that that was the

392
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,209
discriminator of this AI mechanism of

393
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:23,709
this loop so was the user doing anything

394
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:24,520
wrong neither user was actually innocent

395
00:15:23,710 --> 00:15:26,110
in this and

396
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,329
had to get to the bottom of why the user

397
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:29,350
was running this code as far as the user

398
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,510
was concerned they were getting the

399
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:33,400
correct outputs okay out of this piece

400
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:35,439
of code that came from github so they

401
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,150
were innocent victims right the code had

402
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,950
been passed around four or five very

403
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:40,720
very large research institutional labs

404
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:43,330
around the world one from Europe one

405
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,250
from Japan one from Hong Kong and one

406
00:15:43,330 --> 00:15:46,900
from Australia it would been tampered

407
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:48,250
with in a really sophisticated way to

408
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,410
the point where we couldn't tell the

409
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,700
difference between the binary and the

410
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:53,380
user got their scientific outputs

411
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,250
everything looked sweet so they were

412
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,050
getting what they needed

413
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:57,490
but the payload was attacking an

414
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:59,469
organization in an extremely

415
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:02,080
sophisticated way right and they were

416
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:03,670
using GPUs to do it right so the

417
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,950
implication for this stuff is that it's

418
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:09,310
really hard to detect malicious code for

419
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:10,210
us right it's really really hard we

420
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:11,979
didn't know was happening in till after

421
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:13,540
the fact of course we couldn't see

422
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:16,270
anything because the user was getting

423
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:18,760
their outputs and an unusual bit of

424
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:21,160
traffic it's not always enough to put

425
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,360
your hands in the air I don't come from

426
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,040
the space that a lot of you come from

427
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:25,540
and you have probably very advanced

428
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:27,459
techniques to look at traffic patterns

429
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:29,079
and whatnot all the time but when you

430
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,760
see something pop-up and maybe send a

431
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,160
text file occasionally or something over

432
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,360
an email transport like that no one

433
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,890
would think anything of it it could be

434
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:39,070
somebody emailing their colleague in

435
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:40,240
some automated way we don't know so you

436
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:42,580
know the way to get to the bottom of

437
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,380
these things were social means we had to

438
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,840
walk around and talk to people and ask

439
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:48,400
questions about what was going on here

440
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,540
and then track that back to another lab

441
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,160
and then track it back to another lab

442
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,510
and track it back to another lab until

443
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:54,370
we got an answer about where this thing

444
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:57,010
had been tampered with a long time so

445
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:59,130
heuristics tend to fail us here you get

446
00:16:57,010 --> 00:17:02,560
to look but you need to look very deep

447
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:04,060
so you know this is just a little bit of

448
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,740
an example about where our fail tube and

449
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:08,409
outputs got in some of the IP blocks

450
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:10,810
that started spewing my assisted min

451
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:13,990
back home was kind of office tree that

452
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:14,490
day so how does this end right how does

453
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,569
it end

454
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,520
researchers don't really you know as

455
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:20,619
research we don't have the resources to

456
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:23,560
be security intensive it's not what we

457
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:25,239
are ok we go fast we break things we

458
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:27,099
melt worlds and we discover things and

459
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,510
we kill cancer right things are going to

460
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:31,419
be better for everybody one day because

461
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:32,680
of the things we try to achieve it

462
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,780
doesn't have any interest or appetite

463
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,790
insecurities either these systems exist

464
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,050
for research I guess a concluding

465
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,850
possibility

466
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:41,590
if you want to call it that is you know

467
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:44,080
we throw that financial attack surface

468
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:45,459
and that risk over the edge where we do

469
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:47,050
wild and crazy things and we put it in a

470
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,720
public cloud and then here you can do

471
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:51,129
your stuff out there you know we want to

472
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,360
burn dangerous cycles and make a mess of

473
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:53,860
the place we'll do it on your own dime

474
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,340
do it out there it might be better out

475
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,659
there

476
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,010
do we want to make a mess maybe we can

477
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:58,990
do it out there maybe we can pin it in

478
00:17:57,010 --> 00:18:03,129
the public cloud in a safer way it won't

479
00:17:58,990 --> 00:18:04,990
harm us it will harm only itself okay so

480
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:07,929
it's a public cloud of risk mitigation

481
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:10,120
mechanism or is he a risk creation

482
00:18:07,929 --> 00:18:14,170
mechanism or is a both I think it could

483
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:15,879
be post right all right so how you

484
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:17,890
choose your cloud and where you're going

485
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,260
to run things really ends up depending

486
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:22,990
on a couple of factors the one factor

487
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:26,309
start with the big one that we tend not

488
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:28,350
to say is all important but is is money

489
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:31,090
so if you're a capital expenditure

490
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:32,320
focused organization then you have to

491
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:34,030
make choices if you're a greenfield

492
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,100
setup and you don't have any hardware

493
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:38,950
purchased you don't have a data center

494
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:41,230
then maybe going into the cloud makes a

495
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:43,660
lot of sense versus if you're an

496
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:46,900
established organization that has all of

497
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:49,440
those things and that best you are not

498
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:51,550
buying a set of new hardware for example

499
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:53,530
there's a question about operational

500
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:55,950
expenditure if you're a cost recovery

501
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:58,300
organization versus a non cost recovery

502
00:18:55,950 --> 00:19:00,360
makes a big difference if you Netflix

503
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:03,309
you charge your people to use the cloud

504
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:05,320
whatever they need you charge them a

505
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:07,330
better ability and better economists and

506
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:10,149
we do a writer

507
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:13,178
stuff course do your staff costs change

508
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:15,790
well the expertise for running services

509
00:19:13,179 --> 00:19:17,590
on infrastructures or servers don't

510
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:19,809
really change as far as I can tell you

511
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:21,870
you have different knowledge but your

512
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:24,850
staff numbers don't change around that

513
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:27,100
you need to maintain or you need to

514
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:29,980
maintain less hardware and plant at your

515
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:33,760
site they have some potential saving

516
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:36,520
there but cloud leverage solutions might

517
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,280
require more time to test because you

518
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,530
now have more toys to play with you have

519
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:44,260
the ability to design better services

520
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:46,330
and all of this takes time of course the

521
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:48,010
solution you end up may well be much

522
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:50,399
much much superior to what you can do

523
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:52,830
in-house in a single data center

524
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,500
and lots of your support stuff counts

525
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:58,020
may increase so especially with platform

526
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,460
and software as a service if you have an

527
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:02,250
email solution you're moving to office

528
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:04,799
365 your users are getting a lot more

529
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,630
toys so again you have probably much

530
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,080
more support requirements around that

531
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:12,690
and finally on the point of cost savings

532
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,908
even if you're saving those costs on

533
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:16,409
staff do you end up giving that money

534
00:20:14,909 --> 00:20:20,929
away to your professional services

535
00:20:16,409 --> 00:20:20,929
people or your hosting organization

536
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:27,899
other things were from flexibility for

537
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:29,490
users may well improve but you really

538
00:20:27,899 --> 00:20:32,250
have to be selective about which cloud

539
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:34,320
services you use so if you go blindly

540
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:36,600
cloud first you're probably going to

541
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:41,309
have an issue so buzzwords we found the

542
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:43,230
other day doesn't matter you change this

543
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:46,799
to staff well a change is not a saving

544
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:49,409
and lastly the workflow and flexibility

545
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:51,929
of the organization depend on the

546
00:20:49,409 --> 00:20:55,970
industry the use case the organizational

547
00:20:51,929 --> 00:20:59,220
maturity and the number of services

548
00:20:55,970 --> 00:21:01,470
flexibility as your complexity issues

549
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:04,919
which of course is an issue to security

550
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:07,470
setups but at the same time you make a

551
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:10,529
resilient some may gain resilience

552
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:13,710
improvements so on the other side of

553
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:15,120
things it depends on the purpose so this

554
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:19,320
is kind of where things get a little bit

555
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:21,719
I guess ideological the context in which

556
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:23,820
you launch into cloud computing kind of

557
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:26,039
matters seems to be a lot of ideologies

558
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:27,960
out there rather than quantitative and

559
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:30,570
qualitative analysis in the way things

560
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:33,570
are being done in this sector and I say

561
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:35,279
this is a as a comment to the sector in

562
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:37,678
general not just in security and I think

563
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:41,399
the sector should listen I know you all

564
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:43,590
understand these things there are

565
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:46,168
entities in the sector that don't and

566
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:48,000
they need to take note you know rather

567
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:50,220
than this ideology of cloud you know

568
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,100
centric first focused whatever it's

569
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:54,539
about appropriate use of technology and

570
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,770
you can get yourself into a lot of

571
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:56,879
trouble if you're not thinking a little

572
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:59,250
bit more carefully a little more

573
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:01,559
credibly what got to teach you and what

574
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:03,360
those IDC guys teach you down between

575
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:05,210
those lines is not necessarily

576
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,770
the truth then we should wake up right

577
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:09,240
depending on the actual strategic

578
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:10,799
research or Enterprise drivers which

579
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,940
you've got going things could look very

580
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,220
different for each and every

581
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:15,690
organization all I can say is people

582
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:17,910
need to wake up

583
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:19,740
you know governance although cumbersome

584
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:22,290
it needs to be applied to this cloud

585
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:24,690
block thing and there's rogue instances

586
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:26,610
of this that are everywhere so it's not

587
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:29,910
just infrastructure which spans and

588
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:31,590
makes a mess clouds do it too there are

589
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:33,150
people whose intelligence in this room I

590
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:35,580
respect quite a bit who have ranted to

591
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:37,470
me before about how we're just doing

592
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:39,360
exactly the same things we always did in

593
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:40,830
clouds but you know we used to do it in

594
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,270
infrastructure now we do it in clouds we

595
00:22:40,830 --> 00:22:44,129
make a mess in clouds instead of in our

596
00:22:42,270 --> 00:22:47,490
data centers so it's something to really

597
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:49,500
think about and be mindful of but it's

598
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:52,049
not all bad so you have security

599
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,850
services which supplement and leverage

600
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:56,850
cloud characteristics so we've kind of

601
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:59,040
cold storage scenarios where we ensure

602
00:22:56,850 --> 00:23:01,080
that you dull is far far away and if you

603
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,879
arrange with your insurance in advance

604
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,799
that when you have to activate that

605
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,660
recall you don't pay for the data

606
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,929
transfer or the insurance has to cover

607
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:11,250
it then that's quite a good solution

608
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:12,750
backup and disaster recovery as a

609
00:23:11,250 --> 00:23:15,120
service can get you out of your

610
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:17,130
specialized equipment like tape drives

611
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:19,949
he's worth more than me but for me

612
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:23,910
that's very specialized and I seldom you

613
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:26,100
know try to interact with them and Curt

614
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:28,440
also encourages good continuity designed

615
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:30,149
you have physical differentiation where

616
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:33,480
you can design an architect setups that

617
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:35,760
enable continuity you can reveal real

618
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:39,330
issues by actually testing your setup

619
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:41,720
and the testing you can do by cloning

620
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:43,740
your actual life stuff into another

621
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:46,679
availability zone another country and

622
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:49,650
working on the real thing probably not

623
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:52,140
in production but nevertheless any of

624
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:54,750
cloud native services so things that are

625
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,580
born off the cloud email comes to mind

626
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:59,220
it's it's always been in the cloud and

627
00:23:56,580 --> 00:24:02,030
office 365 is not a gigantic revelation

628
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:04,230
web hosting cloud storage the same thing

629
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:05,760
you have services that benefit from

630
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:07,919
cloud characteristics like you're

631
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,710
monitoring setups which are remote and

632
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:13,040
looking in probably can scale much

633
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:15,750
better to your data influx over time

634
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:17,580
back up again not local doesn't matter

635
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:20,220
if your building burns down

636
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:22,040
hsm archives for very cold storage we

637
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:23,730
touched on malware scanning

638
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,889
sandboxing doesn't hit your

639
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:28,410
infrastructure it gets dealt with before

640
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:30,540
it gets there clapper cloud systems so

641
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:33,750
passwords saves device management MDM

642
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:38,270
type things and unique scenarios so your

643
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:41,100
small tasks flow SurveyMonkey large

644
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:42,809
complex things that enable you to do

645
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:46,199
your stuff but aren't part of your

646
00:24:42,809 --> 00:24:48,510
business so that database for your

647
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,150
inventory system that really you just

648
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:54,419
have to have for legislative reasons and

649
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:55,950
yes diversity or location services can

650
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:57,809
also save you a lot of money depending

651
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:59,820
on what business you in it really

652
00:24:57,809 --> 00:25:00,470
depends what the organization wants to

653
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:05,370
be

654
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:07,590
so in conclusion on the top for cloud

655
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:10,469
service that can change the risk profile

656
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:14,549
of services the skills and duties of

657
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:16,710
your staff and save or cost money and on

658
00:25:14,549 --> 00:25:19,980
the other side it's all dependent on the

659
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:22,080
organization each specific service the

660
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:24,419
service requirements the interactions

661
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:27,928
with other services and the resultant

662
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:28,740
architecture one or two things remain

663
00:25:27,929 --> 00:25:31,230
for sure

664

00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:35,730
iterative process as as your solution

666
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:38,610
lives things will feed into each other

667

and then feedback and lastly strange

668
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:44,668
