1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,350
now next figure from the wonderful

2
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:05,160
people at mime cast sponsors of also we

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:07,318
couldn't do it without them

4
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:12,349
please give Garrett ohhara a big round

5
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,349
of applause oil's Garrett thanks Adam

6
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:17,100
morning everybody we did on Wednesday I

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,509
was chatting to the co fans guys about

8
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,670
how this would go and we thought maybe

9
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:22,830
mom Kash should have sponsored travel

10
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,630
pillows and McDonald's and insider' me

11
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,448
talk and the guys played whale song just

12
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,269
to get over last night but thanks for

13
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:32,820
for coming along so I work in mime cast

14
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:35,339
and as part of my job I get to talk to

15
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:37,380
folks like yourselves about security all

16
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:39,329
the time so we talked about the security

17
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,399
stack we talked about instant response

18
00:00:39,329 --> 00:00:44,280
seems or all that kind of stuff but the

19
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:46,289
conversation over the last 18 months two

20
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,539
years seems to always come back to

21
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,309
humans and a couple of things that

22
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:51,899
actually jessie has has kind of already

23
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,320
spoken about I'm kind of gonna do a bit

24
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:57,809
of a deep dive into that so given it's

25
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,020
about humans I kind of want to start

26
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:04,048
with some biology and specifically the

27
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:06,150
notion of defensive reactivity which is

28
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,590
basically something that happens in your

29
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,820
amygdala or your lizard brain is

30
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,549
probably how you guys would know it and

31
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,380
it's the thing that's when we didn't

32
00:01:11,549 --> 00:01:16,229
live in sort of safe environments like

33
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,820
offices or you know go to the Marriott

34
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:19,070
hotel for conferences back when we were

35
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,508
on the plains we had to fight

36
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:23,850
saber-toothed Tigers and wooly mammoths

37
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:26,189
it's essentially our emergency response

38
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:29,970
system and it's the thing that protected

39
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:31,439
us so the important thing here really is

40
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:33,179
that it's an instinctual thing it's not

41
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,979
something anyone intentionally chooses

42
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:37,890
it just happens when there's a perceived

43
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:41,369
threat we this thing this thing happens

44
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:42,930
to us you will see things like raised

45
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:45,750
cortisol levels your heart rate will go

46
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,450
up blood flow will increase so it's the

47
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,490
kind of flight or flight response your

48
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,570
alerts you're gonna run faster you're

49
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,309
probably gonna be able to fight better

50
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:55,079
than you would normally but what you

51
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:58,079
probably don't to do is sit down to do

52
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:00,119
like Sudoku or crosswords or those kind

53
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,009
of things and you can't control this

54
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,740
but it's responsible for many of the

55
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:07,469
issues that we see in terms of that user

56
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,989
awareness the change in end-user

57
00:02:07,469 --> 00:02:13,299
behavior some of which Jesse spoke to

58
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:15,430
already so ultimately

59
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:19,860
divot II causes defensiveness and

60
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:22,000
defensive people can't really hear so

61
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,580
humans are awful now by that I don't

62
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,130
mean if people flew in which many of us

63
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,780
did that we took the armrest from the

64
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:31,200
person that sat in the middle row or

65
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:33,520
that we put the toilet paper so it rolls

66
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,929
to the inside against the wall instead

67
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,450
of outside which is what everybody

68
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,790
should be doing really mean more in

69
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:42,850
terms of the inbuilt things that we have

70
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:45,459
as humans that can affect how we do

71
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:47,079
things like communicate so often what we

72
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,750
say we think we've said one thing but

73
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,580
what's been understood is something else

74
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,660
we have to make assumptions if you

75
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,770
didn't make assumptions you would go

76
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:56,590
crazy right there's so much information

77
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:58,090
that flows in in any given day that you

78
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,640
really have to be able to do that to

79
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:02,560
survive in the world the flipside is

80
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,269
that it actually also causes problems

81
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,160
sometimes in terms of the assumptions

82
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,690
that we make things like the

83
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,060
dunning-kruger effect which has been

84
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:12,280
much publicized over the last few years

85
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:14,650
so that notion that if you're really

86
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,020
confident about something it often

87
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:19,120
correlates to a lack of skill or

88
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,489
competence sometimes and I'm sure

89
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,020
everyone's probably experienced the

90
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:24,880
senior leadership where you see massive

91
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,590
amount of confidence but actually not a

92
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,959
whole lot of competence sometimes so

93
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:31,120
it's kind of fairly common thing but

94
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:33,400
ultimately it's about emotions and the

95
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,600
fact that's I feel like we've had too

96
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,040
much to drink

97
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,040
if we had a late nights not enough

98
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,109
caffeine or sleep that we're gonna be

99
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,090
affected emotionally by that stuff and

100
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:45,580
that plays into many different things so

101
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,489
things like our ability to make

102
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:50,010
decisions and good decisions or

103
00:03:47,489 --> 00:03:52,720
understand things like risk and these

104
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:55,780
amazingly enthusiastic guys who are

105
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,510
having a barbecue and also wanted to be

106
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,220
in the paddle pool at the same time if

107
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:03,429
you think about the average security

108
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:05,170
person a CSO going into a essentially

109
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:07,060
complex operating environments of

110
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:10,420
companies that may have may have been

111
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:12,670
around for decades where legacy systems

112
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,799
have got their tentacles in to all the

113
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:16,719
sort of business operations that's a

114
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,310
really hard operate environments you

115
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,030
operate in and to make good decisions

116
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:24,850
and being human doesn't help us change

117
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:27,250
is hard at a personal level anyone who's

118
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,720
ever given up cigarettes back

119
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,550
a nightmare that thing we're at a

120
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,100
conference like this be go outside and

121
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:35,620
have a have a cigarette and talk to

122
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,750
people and it's a hard thing to give

123
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:39,870
away it's a known pattern it's safe it

124
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:43,060
feels good at an organizational level

125
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:45,130
similar stuff we we kind of know what

126
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,330
works and changing sometimes it's hard

127
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,700
because often there's that dip in

128
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:50,530
productivity in the short term for an

129
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:52,330
outcome that maybe is understood but is

130
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:54,190
also kind of a bet because it's never

131
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:56,590
binary it's never it's going to work

132
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:59,260
it's always we think it's gonna work

133
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:00,609
so that's tough it's hard to and I'm

134
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,020
gonna really focus today on the

135
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:03,430
communication side of things because

136
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,349
that really is where the conversations

137
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,940
that I've been having lately seem to

138
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:09,970
land all the time and the notion that

139
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:11,680
again as humans we get things wrong you

140
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,060
know we we think we're being understood

141
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,130
but actually when you when you sort of

142
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:16,930
talk of people they haven't really

143
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,580
understood what you've said we choose

144
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:20,110
the wrong modes of communication we

145
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,680
choose the wrong cut the language that

146
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:27,610
we use and these things are all related

147
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,260
so how they play together is reasonably

148
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:31,690
well understood you need to make good

149
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:34,240
decisions and kind of understand how we

150
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:35,770
are as humans after those decisions have

151
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,110
been made they need to be communicated

152
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:40,539
well for change to be effective and

153
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:45,010
essentially you see the beautiful circle

154
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:47,320
of life take place so starting we're

155
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:49,300
looking at communicating up or across

156
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,890
depending on where you are within an

157
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,900
organization and I think this reflects

158
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:53,469
some of what jesse is sort of spoken to

159
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,469
you already

160
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,870
and the notion that quite often when we

161
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:01,419
are trying to get buy-in for projects

162
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,919
and spend on technology really any

163
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:05,140
change or program of works in

164
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:08,409
cybersecurity you hear comments like

165
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:10,330
Mikko yesterday where he asked the board

166
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,400
asked him why they were spending 50

167
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:14,260
thousand euros on security when they

168
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,700
didn't have a security problem and the

169
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,349
you know the comment and we don't have a

170
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,659
cleaning problem so why should we pay

171
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:21,790
for cleaners that points to the problem

172
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:23,979
here I think Michael also commented

173
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,750
there's a question something like are we

174
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:27,280
secure and that's obviously an

175
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,890
impossible question to answer but it

176
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,190
points to a disconnect in communication

177
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:36,340
a big part of that is the language that

178
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:38,919
we use so we obviously in this industry

179
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:40,539
have our vernacular have our almost like

180
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:40,960
it's not slang but it's the things we

181
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:42,818
use

182
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,650
communicator and it seems cross-site

183
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:49,449
scripting it's C V's vulnerabilities all

184
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:51,250
the language and the things that we say

185
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:54,310
on a kind of daily basis if I'm a

186
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:56,860
business on the business side and

187
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,539
Finance or on a board I that's not my

188
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,970
language my language is productivity

189
00:06:58,539 --> 00:07:03,460
it's the pl it's shareholder value it's

190
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:05,919
risk mitigation and and there's

191
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,090
definitely a disconnect there and you

192
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,948
see that

193
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:11,020
tinium did a report on this stuff and

194
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:12,669
the board members for some of the most

195
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:16,389
highly vulnerable companies when they

196
00:07:12,669 --> 00:07:18,549
responded to their survey didn't know or

197
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:20,979
weren't able to interpret cybersecurity

198
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,720
reports so this is a kind of a

199
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:25,870
well-established problem that exists

200
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:28,270
within the industry I'm going to point

201
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:31,150
to this book if you guys haven't read it

202
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:32,349
I highly recommend it it's by Phil

203
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,090
dongho he came from governance

204
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:35,349
background but has written honestly one

205
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:37,900
of the best books in terms of cyber

206
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:40,509
resilience that I've I've seen and he

207
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:43,239
talks to this this notion of how do you

208
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:46,780
communicate and and what's useful for a

209
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:49,240
boards to to understand cybersecurity so

210
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:53,349
he talks about things like an ambiguous

211
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:55,479
and relatable information for a board he

212
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:57,340
talks about aligning the conversation to

213
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:59,440
a board with business outcomes and

214
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:00,789
business strategy and obviously that

215
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,099
encompasses the you know the crown

216
00:08:00,789 --> 00:08:04,870
jewels the high-value digital assets but

217
00:08:03,099 --> 00:08:07,060
ultimately it has to be a business

218
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:10,150
conversation not a server security or

219
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:12,520
technology conversation at the notion of

220
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:15,609
pointless metrics is another big one

221
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,229
so like we see we see the thing where

222
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:20,320
people will report in our industry

223
00:08:17,229 --> 00:08:22,150
sometimes on the number of spam messages

224
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:24,550
spam messages that are blocked per

225
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:26,020
quarter or per month and it's a big

226
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:28,169
number often so you know could be five

227
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,849
million ten million ten million messages

228
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:32,799
is that good or is it bad if I'm a

229
00:08:30,849 --> 00:08:34,059
business after I sit in the business

230
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,218
side of things I don't really know

231
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:39,098
what's the impact if that number went up

232
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:40,899
or went down so making sure that the

233
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:42,849
metrics that are used are not pointless

234
00:08:40,899 --> 00:08:44,560
is is obviously fairly critical but

235
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:47,649
ultimately it's about being brief be

236
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,449
concise but being relevant to the

237
00:08:47,649 --> 00:08:51,080
business in the communications to the

238
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:54,660
board

239
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,279
the other side of the fence then is when

240
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:59,760
you're not communicating up or across is

241
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:02,370
the conversation to end users and Jessie

242
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,930
cover this pretty well I think I'm gonna

243
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:06,120
echo a lot of what she said

244
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:08,069
the these are the people who sit on the

245
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,300
front desk they sit in hate or they

246
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:11,880
drive the trucks they're working

247
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,529
logistics finance legal whatever it is

248
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,350
they're not us they're the the other

249
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:19,320
people and there's really two sides I

250
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:21,750
believe to the issue here the first one

251
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:23,580
is that we get the a couple of things

252
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,010
wrong so we have people who are experts

253
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:29,460
in security CISOs InfoSec personnel

254
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:31,290
security experts who are brilliant at

255
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,200
their jobs but then they're forced into

256
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,910
the I think Jessie gold and squishy

257
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:38,100
skills the notion that they then have to

258
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:40,620
somehow be really really good at this

259
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,000
other thing which is communication and I

260
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,890
think that's kind of unfair and it's

261
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,570
generally not very effective we choose

262
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:51,270
interesting modes of communication we

263
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:54,660
left a little handout there the little

264
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:56,699
page which is an example of a security

265
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:58,800
email bulletin the things that get sent

266
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:02,220
around quite often on a monthly basis

267
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:05,370
and I would question their effectiveness

268
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:07,170
as the reality it's something that often

269
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:09,300
is has to be done for compliance reasons

270
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:11,550
but there are better modes of

271
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:13,380
communication that are available to us

272
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:14,640
now things like video things like

273
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,950
potentially face to face or

274
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,600
instructor-led training but that's kind

275
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:21,000
of where the the conversation needs to

276
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,040
you to go to and really important that

277
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,830
we kind of start to drop the jargon and

278
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,040
we use punchy messaging that will cut

279
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:30,540
through to to the folks who are

280
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,550
generally just not as interested and

281
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,920
don't care as much as we think they do

282
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:37,939
so these are people who are extremely

283
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:40,020
busy they have their boss who always

284
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,700
annoyed with them because the 10 things

285
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:44,010
they were expected to do haven't been

286
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:45,630
done so they've they've got office

287
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:47,640
politics they've just got so much other

288
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:50,339
stuff going on that when that email

289
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:52,650
arrives in do they care they honestly

290
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:54,120
generally don't and that's where we

291
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:57,180
start to kind of run into problems and

292
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,860
we end up with this guy and Jesse's

293
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,930
gonna mention the the idiot you know the

294
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,820
idiots notion I've heard some really

295
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:03,689
funny metrics within security teams

296
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,890
they're kind of

297
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:07,350
they don't get shared with the wider

298
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:10,650
team so one of them was the clown rate

299
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:12,810
at the muppet metric various variations

300
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:15,480
on the users being kind of silly people

301
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:17,699
who don't really kind of get this stuff

302
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,590
and I'm gonna challenge that and say

303
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:21,600
that actually it's not on them it's kind

304
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:23,610
of on us and we've used really

305
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,650
ineffective communications who an

306
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:28,590
audience that is really generally pretty

307
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:31,640
disinterested and I believe that comes

308
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:33,840
from the notion of compliance where

309
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:36,630
really what we've done is a box-ticking

310
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,820
exercise we've got a requirement to

311
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:42,810
maybe have 95 percent of people watch

312
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:44,010
the LMS video on security so generally

313
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:45,689
what they will do if they're anything

314
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:47,490
like me is they'll play the video on

315
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:48,660
their second screen and then on the

316
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:51,420
primary screen they'll just continue

317
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,589
working the little box pops up to say

318
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:55,589
you know do you accept that you've

319
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:57,510
completed this module - yes and you go

320
00:11:55,590 --> 00:12:00,720
about your day but nothing has actually

321
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:03,060
changed and I think we need to be much

322
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,940
more aligned with a behavior change

323
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:09,000
model and that's much more messy it's

324
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,830
not as clean but it does use a motion to

325
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,200
cut through to get to the end users and

326
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:14,730
I Dec oh the the use of the advertising

327
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,950
approach that works we know that works

328
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:18,930
if you think about the advertising

329
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:21,660
industry they're masters at getting us

330
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:23,280
to buy things or change behavior they

331
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,750
would never use what's on your table

332
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:27,589
there which is a wall of text that just

333
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,590
doesn't work that way

334
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:33,599
this isn't a cybersecurity problem this

335
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:35,400
is very much a human problem where you

336
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,260
have important information being

337
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,689
transmitted to a completely

338
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:42,000
disinterested audience so that could be

339
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:43,770
back on I smoked I would probably do

340
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,330
exactly what that guy is doing because

341
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:46,970
there was times for a really really

342
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:49,650
really just wanted a cigarette

343
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:51,720
the little old lady's tard she's not

344
00:12:49,650 --> 00:12:53,130
gonna see that wet paint sign she's hard

345
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,450
it's not part of part of what's

346
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:57,000
important to her in that given moments

347
00:12:54,450 --> 00:12:58,320
or the the Beamer driver I still don't

348
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,380
really know how that happens but there

349
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:06,000
you go so this is a human problem and

350
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:08,370
and that's kind of where we are this is

351
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,170
this is Leo the Labradoodle he's

352
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:12,360
actually my friends and colleague

353
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:15,150
Ryan's dog he lives in Melbourne with

354
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:16,899
Ryan and he's you can see here he's way

355
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:19,329
more successful than I've ever been on

356
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:20,529
social media he's got 1,300 followers

357
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:22,540
and this is a few months old so he's

358
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:25,110
probably doing even more than that now

359
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:26,949
but this is the world we live in where

360
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,480
employees don't just have their own

361
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:30,519
social media Ken's but I know many

362
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,220
people who have their pets on things

363
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:34,749
like Instagram and they have their own

364
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,309
accounts they've got their own followers

365
00:13:34,749 --> 00:13:39,069
and that's that's kind of where we're at

366
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:42,610
so what we're actually competing with is

367
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:44,618
these dopamine hitters the 11 seconds

368
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,480
YouTube video thing that that's what

369
00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:48,730
we're competing with but yet we're still

370
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:50,889
sending out emails that are just dry

371
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:53,679
boring and will never resonate with the

372
00:13:50,889 --> 00:13:56,350
end users so you've got snapchat

373
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:58,449
Facebook Instagram you know Skype and

374
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,860
Twitter people probably have mobile

375
00:13:58,449 --> 00:14:02,258
phones sitting on their desks that's

376
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:04,749
gonna beep when a new message comes in

377
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:06,730
on the friends group in whatsapp or if

378
00:14:04,749 --> 00:14:08,709
somebody likes the photo of the sandwich

379
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:11,170
that they'd for lunch but those things

380
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:12,699
are constantly happening so not only do

381
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:14,740
you have really important information

382
00:14:12,699 --> 00:14:16,599
that you need to get through to a

383
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,389
disinterested audience but they're also

384
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:23,819
massively distracted and what you don't

385
00:14:19,389 --> 00:14:26,309
have is people who look like this and

386
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:29,199
there you go

387
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:30,399
so there's probably some people who know

388
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,120
exactly what happened there and then

389
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,429
there's a bunch of people who are

390
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,170
wondering why did people throw airplanes

391
00:14:33,429 --> 00:14:36,759
we actually changed it normally we have

392
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:37,990
people just roll them into balls and

393
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:39,339
throw them at this stage so it looks

394
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:42,069
like they're kind of really not digging

395
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:45,309
the talk that little sheet of paper on

396
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:46,839
your on your table one of the bullet

397
00:14:45,309 --> 00:14:48,490
points near the end says something along

398
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:51,129
the lines of if you throw a paper

399
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:55,059
airplane onto the stage we actually have

400
00:14:51,129 --> 00:14:59,050
a winner here that you have the option

401
00:14:55,059 --> 00:15:00,910
to win $100 Visa card so we have a

402
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:04,349
winner which is Shane Madison wherever

403
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:06,430
you are come and see me nice job Shane

404
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:13,700
yeah random applause that was awesome

405
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:16,979
[Applause]

406
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:18,420
so like the point of that is just like

407
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,190
it's a it's a funny thing but that's

408
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:22,170
what happens every single time some

409
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:24,720
people will have read it most people

410
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:27,060
won't and that's kind of the the issue

411
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,950
in a lot of these comms so we still talk

412
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:30,959
with Dan Gregory from the grew and

413
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:32,610
transfer or The Impossible Institute

414
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:34,140
last year at the the AZ conference

415
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:37,020
actually who were supporters of all

416
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:38,850
sorts and he used one of the best

417
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,860
analogies I've seen for our industry

418
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:44,340
which is the thing where you get on a

419
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:45,600
plane and the airlines legally are

420
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,040
required to tell you this really

421
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,930
important information that may save your

422
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,310
life but when people get on the plane

423
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:52,949
what they're really thinking about is

424
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:55,530
the Long Island iced tea they'll have in

425
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:57,570
the swim bar in Thailand or that the

426
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:59,040
airplane pulled away from the gate a

427
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:00,300
couple of minutes late so they're maybe

428
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,819
going to be late for their meeting or

429
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:04,859
will the kids go feral and or will they

430
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:07,380
watch the entertainment system but it's

431
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:10,410
that rather than tensing the number of

432
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:12,060
rows to the exit which may be behind you

433
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:14,400
people don't pay attention so it's a

434
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,800
perfect analogy for our industry a

435
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:19,110
completely disinterested audience really

436
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,630
important information and what you saw

437
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:22,680
was this transformation where

438
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:24,990
organizations like Virgin Atlantic

439
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:27,689
started becoming much more informal they

440
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:29,940
introduced kind of cartoony safety

441
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:30,960
booklets in the back of seats and all

442
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,400
the sudden people started becoming

443
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:35,430
engaged and it evolved to the point

444
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:39,480
where you have barely concealed nudity

445
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:40,500
so this is Air New Zealand air this is

446
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:44,220
body paint so that guy was actually

447
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:46,560
naked same exact legal requirements but

448
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:49,890
now built into a kind of much more

449
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,420
consumable and memorable format and I

450
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:54,030
feel okay with having a nipple on the

451
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,860
screen given that Miko basically said

452
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:57,360
the full version of mofos yesterday and

453
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:59,610
there was a naked person on this the

454
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:03,450
previous slide I was looking like should

455
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:05,550
we do this but this is where we go you

456
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:07,200
can see how this works so there's some

457
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:09,960
some considerations here in terms that

458
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,460
have this all ties together the comms to

459
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,760
end users like there's things to think

460
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:16,319
about the cadence of communications you

461
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,150
want it to be look at our experience

462
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:20,280
around monthly is good if it goes too

463
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:21,329
often it starts to become part of the

464
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,189
noise that people just

465
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:26,459
you kind of eliminate and ignore every

466
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:29,249
kind of every time they see it the mode

467
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:30,720
needs to be correct so it could be an

468
00:17:29,249 --> 00:17:33,059
email but the email needs to be written

469
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,889
in a way to Jessi's point it uses bold

470
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:36,360
it's got a you know a single punchy

471
00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:38,488
message that is actionable and that

472
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:41,668
people will remember rather than long

473
00:17:38,489 --> 00:17:43,110
verbose emails that are full of kind of

474
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:46,139
technical jargon they just they don't

475
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:48,689
work things like short videos generally

476
00:17:46,139 --> 00:17:51,059
humor is incredibly incredibly good at

477
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:54,359
cutting through again pointing to the

478
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:57,269
advertising industry how often do the

479
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:59,100
ads that we remember use humor for us to

480
00:17:57,269 --> 00:18:02,549
kind of relate to them that's a fairly

481
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:04,830
common approach and what you want to get

482
00:18:02,549 --> 00:18:07,649
to is the the state where you've created

483
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:09,418
social norms within the organization

484
00:18:07,649 --> 00:18:11,549
that you're in or or Turnham affect

485
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:13,739
change within where people will look to

486
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:15,269
the leadership and that's that's

487
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:16,710
absolutely critical by the way you need

488
00:18:15,269 --> 00:18:18,989
the leadership board into this stuff

489
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:20,309
because if they're not the employees

490
00:18:18,989 --> 00:18:23,609
will just look at them and say well if

491
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:24,869
they're not doing it why should I so

492
00:18:23,609 --> 00:18:26,220
what you want to get to you is you look

493
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:28,678
at the leadership you look left you look

494
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,389
right and employees realize that if they

495
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:33,419
step away from their laptops they should

496
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:35,219
hit Windows L they shouldn't let people

497
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:37,409
walk through the turnstile right behind

498
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:39,539
them they shouldn't click on every

499
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:41,639
single link in every single email that

500
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:43,590
comes through even for companies that

501
00:18:41,639 --> 00:18:45,869
they're not the customer of but you

502
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:49,499
build up those social norms within your

503
00:18:45,869 --> 00:18:52,649
organization so I'm gonna kind of close

504
00:18:49,499 --> 00:18:55,139
that with this notion of advertising and

505
00:18:52,649 --> 00:18:56,748
I was talking to a guy called Lachlan on

506
00:18:55,139 --> 00:18:59,100
Wednesday who may or may not be here

507
00:18:56,749 --> 00:19:01,080
about this and we got into a

508
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:04,199
conversation about Guinness so I thought

509
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:07,259
it was a good one to include here in

510
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,029
terms of advertising I'm from Ireland so

511
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:11,700
I love Guinness but if I ever had an

512
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:13,830
advertisement sent to me like this I'm

513
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,049
really just gonna zone out I don't care

514
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:18,389
it's to draw it's to word it's never

515
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:20,158
going to change my mind but if you

516
00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:22,289
consider something like this and I'm

517
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:24,059
guessing Australians may probably

518
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:27,029
remember this guy the Emperor nasi

519
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:29,730
goreng see some kind of smiles and some

520
00:19:27,029 --> 00:19:32,039
nods you know this is the guy who told

521
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:33,990
his kid that the Great Wall of China was

522
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:35,100
built to keep the rabbits out and it was

523
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:37,380
built by Emperor Nancy gore

524
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:39,659
like it was a silly sort of funny odd

525
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:42,000
and everybody probably remembers have

526
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,380
human and relatable it was the little

527
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,700
kid at the end kind of ruffling his hair

528
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:47,010
about to get up in front of his class

529
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:49,860
and give the talk in the Great Wall of

530
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:52,770
China it cuts through we all remember

531
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:55,620
that or this lady Deborah Kennedy back

532
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:58,500
in 2000 who uttered the now infamous

533
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:00,449
words not happy John and they're part of

534
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,770
our vernacular they've become something

535
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:04,710
that everybody kind of knows what that

536
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:07,918
means again based on a fairly funny

537
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:09,809
video in an advertising mode that's 20

538
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,630
years old now but we still use that

539
00:20:09,809 --> 00:20:14,100
phrase so I'm gonna say that like lots

540
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:15,590
of amazing stuff has happened if you

541
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:18,090
look at the technology that's available

542
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:19,470
outside it's incredibly this industry

543
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:22,289
has just changed so much in the last

544
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:23,669
four years it's astonishing but I'm

545
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:25,890
gonna challenge us and say that actually

546
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:28,409
the the part where we communicate and

547
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:30,270
that's squishy stuff that maybe we don't

548
00:20:28,409 --> 00:20:32,400
do that as well as we could and that we

549
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:36,658
need to really look at moving the needle

550
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:38,940
of behavior change or user behavior

551
00:20:36,659 --> 00:20:46,710
using behavior change models much more

552
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:48,510
than compliance thank you thank you very

553
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,159
much Garrett please take your Zelda

554
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:52,280
chess set okay thank you for that

555
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,280
presentation
