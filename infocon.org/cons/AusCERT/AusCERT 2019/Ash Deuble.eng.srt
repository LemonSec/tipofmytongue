6
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,680
he's been around for a while I've known

7
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:23,460
for a very long time as well it's a

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:26,099
shame isn't it it's okay I'm dealing

9
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:34,920
through it so if everyone could just

10
00:00:26,099 --> 00:00:38,730
give him a warm welcome thank you hang

11
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:40,440
on there's a thing go up on the screen

12
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:45,538
here on the laptop so it doesn't

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:50,699
actually do anything and the mouse

14
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:53,879
doesn't work thanks Joe appreciate it

15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,460
heckles are always welcome look while

16
00:00:53,879 --> 00:01:01,260
this was doing this a bit of background

17
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:03,439
behind this presentation I guess cheers

18
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:07,289
mate appreciate it

19
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:10,170
good when I was running the abstract for

20
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,720
this presentation I was on the couch

21
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:15,479
with my kids watching kids cartoons and

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,429
all that sort of stuff and any of you

23
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,600
guys that have kids the sort of a

24
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,259
younger age would know about the paw

25
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:24,658
Patrol I assume somehow subliminally

26
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:27,689
this all got added into my presentation

27
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,950
I don't know I'm weird like that guys

28
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:31,820
who have worked with me know I'm a bit

29
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:34,979
off-kilter but so this is what happened

30
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:36,449
and then I had a bit of a thought about

31
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:37,650
how I could do something different

32
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,540
because it's after lunch ever once had a

33
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,549
big lunch we're in a dark room it's cool

34
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,320
everyone feels sleepy I feel sleepy you

35
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:46,350
all feel sleepy so let's do something a

36
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,520
bit different so I don't know why I

37
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:48,929
thought of this but I thought I choose

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,798
your own adventure presentation would be

39
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,240
the way to go I don't know how this is

40
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,570
going to go it's probably going to suck

41
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,039
but who cares right it's a bit of fun

42
00:01:56,570 --> 00:02:03,048
I'm gonna try and get you guys to do

43
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,280
stuff so you know be well aware of that

44
00:02:03,049 --> 00:02:08,280
but it might fail in five minutes who

45
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,619
knows whatever so being a chooser on

46
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,780
president choose your own adventure

47
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:13,890
presentation obviously you guys have to

48
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:16,170
participate so

49
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,179
I'm looking for you know people who

50
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,010
raise their arms and yell out and maybe

51
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,800
do the wave or something stupid when we

52
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:25,440
get to it there's no right or wrong

53
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,410
answers actually there is one wrong

54
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,670
answer but you guys are all pretty smart

55
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:31,020
so you won't pick the wrong answer

56
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,339
unless you're too smart and then you

57
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,690
will pick the wrong answer just because

58
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:36,480
it'd be fine for a giggle and stuff

59
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,250
jonno that will be you cuz you're cool

60
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,910
like that

61
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:43,770
but look we'll get to some points in the

62
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,930
presentation don't be multiple choices

63
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:48,050
I'll get you to yell or something and

64
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:52,200
and we'll go from there

65
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:54,060
so speaking of crowd participation I'm

66
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,890
pretty lazy on it outsource the clicking

67
00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:02,420
on the computer so I'm looking for a

68
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:14,700
volunteer to come up someone come on

69
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:16,049
awesome come up what's your name Mac you

70
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:19,018
right standing here you know how to use

71
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,880
PowerPoint and all that stuff yeah you

72
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:24,720
know when they like five hands versus

73
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,070
seven hats jokey I'll tell you what I

74
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,580
want you to click on something all right

75
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,579
it's all good

76
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:35,369
this presentation is stuff that's

77
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:39,239
happened to me through numerous jobs

78
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:42,930
like this is all stuff that's happened

79
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,519
over and over and over again I'm

80
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:46,110
assuming you guys have all gonna have

81
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:50,190
had something similar happen to you as

82
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:51,780
well so I've obviously changed some

83
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:54,510
details I've changed some names I've

84
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,799
changed some of the I guess some of the

85
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,359
things that have happened because you

86
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:01,739
know we want to make sure that we don't

87
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,360
get sued and stuff right I know so I did

88
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:04,950
we go through to me now very quick it's

89
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,110
all good

90
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,369
they'll be like a whole bunch of choices

91
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,510
and then I'll get you to click on it and

92
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:11,760
hopefully it'll work on here I don't

93
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:14,970
know and if it doesn't we'll always

94
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,630
something out right so anyway so this is

95
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:21,269
you guys paw Patrol straightaway captain

96
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:23,280
turbot his real name's Horatio

97
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:24,570
what an awesome name that is but anyway

98
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,739
you've been in the security field for

99
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,560
ages

100
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:29,720
you know you think you

101
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,720
what there is to know about security

102
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:34,490
you're pretty solid actor and and you've

103
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,020
just started a new job so you're working

104
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:40,490
for a company called cash whale

105
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:42,229
so cash whale has a bunch of research

106
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:44,450
that they do onto wild vomit and stuff

107
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:46,610
like that some intellectual property

108
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:48,620
about how to you know how to catch whale

109
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:50,570
vomit and do cool stuff with it and then

110
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:56,210
they've got a bunch of really cool I

111
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:58,159
guess personal information on on on

112
00:04:56,210 --> 00:05:01,190
famous people and influences that like

113
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,980
to tweet about well vomit so anyway you

114
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:07,190
started at Cash well it's a sort of a

115
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:08,930
small security team there you meet the

116
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,790
team in about five minutes and work out

117
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:12,380
all the pleasantries with them you go

118
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:13,880
through all the stuff with the business

119
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:16,190
and work out what's what and all that

120
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,800
sort of stuff and then you start doing a

121
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:20,900
bit of a gap analysis on a security

122
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,880
function and shock horror disbelief you

123
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:25,909
find out there a bit of a low maturity

124
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:28,610
level they've got a seam and stuff like

125
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:30,140
that in place but you know has it been

126
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:32,630
looked after it hasn't been loved or

127
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,969
anything like that you know it probably

128
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:38,659
needs a bit more work it hasn't got all

129
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:40,880
the the I guess the log sources in there

130
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,530
that you'd like you know there's some

131
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,380
policies and framework like that in

132
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:47,150
there it's really basic actually there's

133
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:50,300
only two policies but you know it's a

134
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:52,810
policy stuff right and and they don't

135
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:57,979
really have much of an incident response

136
00:05:52,810 --> 00:06:00,140
process or capability at the moment so

137
00:05:57,979 --> 00:06:01,370
we've got to do something this is where

138
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:03,530
I'm going to get you start clicking in a

139
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:05,210
second cool so we've got to do something

140
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:06,830
we've only got limited resources and all

141
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,210
that sort of stuff so what we could do

142
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,219
is we could start focusing on our

143
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,020
policies and framework you know we could

144
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,940
probably start designing security in a

145
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,650
way that you know the users in the

146
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,020
organization sort of get a bit of a

147
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:20,479
better feel for what security is and

148
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,099
hopefully start working a bit better by

149
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,650
putting some frameworks in we can

150
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,790
probably work out what the risk is to

151
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:28,429
the business and all that sort of stuff

152
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,840
and start addressing it we could look at

153
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:32,090
doing stuff with our Incident Response

154
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,799
capability so that we don't end up in

155
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,119
the paper and we can you know when

156
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,830
someone taps us on the shoulder to say

157
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,480
something Bad's happening you know we

158
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,490
can probably deal with it in a

159
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:42,080
pretty good manner or we can start

160
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:44,330
putting some tools and technologies in

161
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,890
place because um you know we've all been

162
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:48,530
around the traps we sort of know what's

163
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:50,360
going on we know we should be doing so

164
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:53,179
should we make them stand or wave or

165
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:54,650
what do you want right all right so who

166
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:58,520
wants to do policies and frameworks

167
00:06:54,650 --> 00:07:02,690
start waving your hands furiously one

168
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:04,250
person you're my person - yeah three we

169
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:06,740
should party tonight we can all have a

170
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:10,450
lemonade who wants to do an incident

171
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:12,440
response so that we don't go in the well

172
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:14,870
everyone wants to do incident response

173
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:17,719
so it and what about putting some tools

174
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:20,630
and technology in place I don't know you

175
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:23,300
make the call youngji tools in

176
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:27,130
technology yes sweet can you click it

177
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,130
like can you I don't know if you can

178
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:37,930
poison else gone somewhere Hey so I

179
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:40,280
reckon that's a great idea

180
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,540
we need to put some tools and technology

181
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:43,549
in so easting start getting some

182
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:46,280
visibility into what's going on on our

183
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:47,900
network so we work hard over the next

184
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,659
few months we're putting all the stuff

185
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:52,219
that we think and we start getting a lot

186
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,740
more visibility into what's happening on

187
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:56,240
our network once we start getting that

188
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:58,910
visibility we start working with all the

189
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,560
other people in the itv function the

190
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:03,830
rest of the business to try and get some

191
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,860
processes in place and and you know get

192
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,300
the most out of our tools everything's

193
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:11,810
going along nicely and we start doing

194
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:13,370

197
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:25,550
hear about the most epic event ever to

198
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:27,860
occur in history cash whale is going to

199
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:32,930
hold a Nicholas Cage convention because

200
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:36,800
he is the best but nobody's like think

201
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:39,348

people in the room um so full disclosure

204
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:48,270
I can't stand Nicolas Cage he's a dick

205
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,500
but every time I go into Netflix and

206
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:51,990
look at the movies

207
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,810
every second movie is Nicolas Cage is

208
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:59,610
that just me or does everyone get that

209
00:08:53,810 --> 00:09:02,640
you yeah but no one else or do you guys

210
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:02,820
all like Nicolas Cage yeah you do don't

211
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,470
you

212
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:08,670
I can't stand it anyway we'll move on so

213
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:11,910
obviously this is going to be a really

214
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:13,680
significant event for us you know it's

215
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:18,029
going to draw a lot of attention to our

216
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:19,589
organization we're not really sure we

217
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:21,060
think we should be doing some extra

218
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:22,950
stuff we don't want someone to hack us

219
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,449
or to deface one of our websites you

220
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,070
know we're gonna have a website that's

221
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,839
gonna have pictures of Nicolas Cage all

222
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,070
over it and we don't want some interface

223
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,960
it would like pictures of John Travolta

224
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:33,330
or something right because that's suck

225
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:37,230
all right so we decide to email our boss

226
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:38,880
and ask him if it's true and and start

227
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,279
working out if we should do some sort of

228
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,110
planned to to put some extra stuff in

229
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:49,260
place Joe can you can get that one or

230
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:50,910
John me too are you doing now and for

231
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,660
the people playing along at home that no

232
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,329
paw Patrol

233
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:57,930
harold is actually harold humdinger he's

234
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:59,370
the evil mayor humdinger so if you pick

235
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:01,800
the right choice later on you'll work

236
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:04,470
out why he's evil and he is evil but

237
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,810
anyway so we send an email to him and

238
00:10:04,470 --> 00:10:08,370
this is the email we say hey Harold we

239
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:10,020
hear that Nicolas Cage is coming you

240
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,339
know we're doing this convention it's

241
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,870
gonna be pretty cool do you think we

242
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:15,029
should get some stuff together put some

243
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:18,170
extra security controls in place because

244
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:18,170
we don't want anything bad to happen

245
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,439
Harold comes back with hey captain

246
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:28,459
because it's captain turbot Horatio

247
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:31,529
wouldn't worry about it's only only

248
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:38,069
Nicolas Cage this will be a non-event

249
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:39,990
I mean it's Nicolas Cage so we've got

250
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:42,330
two choices do you think we've got this

251
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:45,000
or should we do a review because you

252
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:47,360
know it's Nicolas Cage so who thinks we

253
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:51,450
got this and don't need to do anything

254
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:55,680
of course you'd say that Reese

255
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:58,560
you love the cage all right who are your

256
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:02,280
records we should do a review yeah

257
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:04,079
course we should do a review there was

258
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:05,550
actually a slide and if you didn't do a

259
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,170
review I was going to ask you if you

260
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:09,150
were drunk and then there was a picture

261
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:10,319
of Homer drunk it was really cool but

262
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:11,939
I'm pretty disappointed you didn't pick

263
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,380
that and that was the wrong answer to

264
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,120
that we spoke to be able to beginning so

265
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:16,470
a little disappoint you weren't smart

266
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,490
enough to actually pick the wrong answer

267
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:20,100
when I really want you to do it but

268
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:21,540
whatever so anyway we engaged a

269
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,210
well-known third party let's call them

270
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:27,630
company X to start assessing our

271
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:28,920
security controls overall they think

272
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:30,150
we're doing okay they give us some

273
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:34,110
recommendations and all that sort of

274
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:35,310
stuff you know they tell us we should

275
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,950
you know do some stuff with our play

276
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:40,439
books whatever before they leave we run

277
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:42,900
through an incident response test and

278
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:44,130
exercise and we just make sure that

279
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:46,170
everyone knows what they're doing in

280
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:49,020
case of an incident so it's not you know

281
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:50,550
something new to us so we let our

282
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:53,640
executive group know and we keep working

283
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:54,839
your way up until the event so another

284
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,819
two choices I'm gonna make everyone

285
00:11:54,840 --> 00:12:01,320
stand up this time stand up what should

286
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:02,700
they do like the wave like that okay

287
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:06,230
we'll get you to stand all this time so

288
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,230
stand up if you think we're good to go I

289
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,819
like you stand up you think we should

290
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:16,439
have done more about yeah we can't do

291
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:19,820
anymore joke something all you guys cuz

292
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:25,170
it's the same choice you should see that

293
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:27,480
thing say you spend a lot of time you

294
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:29,310
know you you extend your security

295
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:32,070
capabilities you get some third parties

296
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:33,930
you know to help you do some stuff you

297
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:35,640
put all your all your logs into your

298
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:38,219
seam and expand your seam and you get it

299
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,600
tuned and all that sort of jazz you get

300
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,460
some Incident Response playbooks

301
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,470
together you throw some DDoS

302
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,570
capabilities in there and you know

303
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:48,140
everything is working really well the

304
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:51,030
event goes off without a hitch

305
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:52,770
yeah I believe the people in the

306
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:56,490
background with the Nick Cage masks are

307
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:58,170
called kaija holux I don't know I also

308
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:00,090
found out while doing this that there's

309
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,709
a plug-in like a add-on for chrome

310
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:03,750
called cage afire and if you've ever

311
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:05,329
seen it and so it just turns like every

312
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:07,220
picture into Nicolas Cage like it

313
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:08,299
from what it was so awesome I didn't

314
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:12,110
know how I could work it into this

315
00:13:08,299 --> 00:13:17,480
though so let me just slide down here a

316
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:18,529
bit oh yeah so we finally have

317
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,670
everything working we've got some

318
00:13:18,529 --> 00:13:22,790
skilled people and all that sort of

319
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:24,529
stuff on board and you know this is

320
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:26,179
where we actually want to be but you

321
00:13:24,529 --> 00:13:27,860
know we know that we can't sort of

322
00:13:26,179 --> 00:13:29,929
sustain it it's a it's a big event

323
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,160
Nicolas Cage so you know the business

324
00:13:29,929 --> 00:13:34,309
isn't going to keep paying for stuff

325
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,689
past Nicolas Cage if I go over time

326
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:42,529
start throwing Mentos or something up

327
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:45,139
all right sweet done so so yeah so and

328
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:46,730
we're going to go next so the

329
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:49,009
organization's really pleased you know

330
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:50,480
they're glad nothing sort of happened

331
00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:51,860
during the event and you know we

332
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,839
continue and one of the things for quite

333
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,679
some time

334
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:56,540
look with everything that happened

335
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:57,679
before the Nic Cage event and through it

336
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,748
you know we feel like we're in a pretty

337
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,249
good position the guys and the team are

338
00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:02,959
starting to look a little bit tired and

339
00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:06,139
knackered and rundown so now's a good

340
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,069
time to give them a break so you know we

341
00:14:06,139 --> 00:14:09,139
could probably give them a break and

342
00:14:07,069 --> 00:14:10,459
it'll be cool but now we've got all

343
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:13,759
these extra resources and all this other

344
00:14:10,459 --> 00:14:15,138
stuff in you know we don't know you know

345
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:17,269
if we're going to see something now

346
00:14:15,139 --> 00:14:19,850
because we're actually looking so we've

347
00:14:17,269 --> 00:14:22,249
got two choices do we let the team go

348
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,759
and have a Becks and a lie-down wave

349
00:14:22,249 --> 00:14:26,569
your hand

350
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:28,959
I guess who reckons we should keep on

351
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:28,959
truckin

352
00:14:32,939 --> 00:14:43,118
keep on truckin let's do it but I know

353
00:14:37,779 --> 00:14:44,889
we do this is awesome up here there's

354
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:47,619
nothing like doing a life thing it never

355
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:49,480
works I did a presentation a couple of

356
00:14:47,619 --> 00:14:50,679
years ago and it was a live demo and the

357
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,029
demo failed and I was up here doing

358
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:53,769
interpretive dance halls waiting for all

359
00:14:52,029 --> 00:14:55,410
the VMS to reboot it was awesome

360
00:14:53,769 --> 00:15:00,160
I still get reminded about it every day

361
00:14:55,410 --> 00:15:03,639
anyway sorry I digress hello I'm here so

362
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,529
the team's really committed to to keep

363
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:08,350
on reviewing things for the next few

364
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:09,220
months and in doing that they said

365
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,919
there's some suspicious activity

366
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:15,069
occurring a couple of websites are

367
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:16,660
getting scanned you know one particular

368
00:15:15,069 --> 00:15:18,488
server is getting a lot of love from

369
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,779
some sort of automated tool could be

370
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:22,449
sequel mapper some and we don't know at

371
00:15:19,779 --> 00:15:23,649
the moment we could easily fix this by

372
00:15:22,449 --> 00:15:25,238
adding some rules into our Web

373
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:26,499
Application Firewall there are firewalls

374
00:15:25,239 --> 00:15:29,230
and it all stopped it but the team

375
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:34,359
thinks it's probably best to investigate

376
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:37,029
this a bit further you can click now so

377
00:15:34,359 --> 00:15:38,769
as we progress and investigate this

378
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:41,319
further we find more and more suspicious

379
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:43,779
activities the activities at the moment

380
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:47,738
don't look particularly malicious but

381
00:15:43,779 --> 00:15:49,059
there's a lot of recon work going on the

382
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:52,569
team goes and asked the other areas of

383
00:15:49,059 --> 00:15:53,829
of IT if they've noticed anything they

384
00:15:52,569 --> 00:15:56,349
don't seem to think there's anything

385
00:15:53,829 --> 00:15:58,299
really going on there's been a couple of

386
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:00,129
things that have been you know false

387
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:02,829
alarms have gone down you know a road

388
00:16:00,129 --> 00:16:05,589
that doesn't mean to go down they

389
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:07,809
reported that one you know users found

390
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:09,519
some sort of phishing email but you know

391
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:11,469
it was pretty well written and took some

392
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,759
of current stuff but you know at the end

393
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:18,039
of the day you get a million phishing

394
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:19,269
mail emails every day you get the team

395
00:16:18,039 --> 00:16:20,499
to start putting all the activity

396
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,939
together in a bit of a timeline see if

397
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:24,369
you can start picking patterns and all

398
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:25,868
of that stuff once they've done that we

399
00:16:24,369 --> 00:16:27,999
see a couple of things that we really

400
00:16:25,869 --> 00:16:30,970
think we should give our boss a bit of a

401
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:33,069
quick heads-up about you learn awesome

402
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:34,600
job Thanks I'm glad I got you I was

403
00:16:33,069 --> 00:16:36,189
going to get Jorge one of the other guys

404
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:39,089
I've worked with before but he would

405
00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:39,089
have stuff it's right up

406
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:45,100
yeah

407
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,010
so you just to be able to call your boss

408
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:50,020
and let him know that you know

409
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:52,870
something's going on and then you get an

410
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:56,020
alert from your DLP solution and it ends

411
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:57,610
up that the DLP solutions grabbed what

412
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:00,040
looks like a movie file and blocked it

413
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:01,330
so once you investigate further you

414
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:03,370
notice that the actual header of the

415
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:05,800
file isn't a movie file but it's a zip

416
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:07,930
file and so once your analyst start

417
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,938
working through that they knows that you

418
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:11,380
know that zip file is a whole bunch of

419
00:17:09,939 --> 00:17:13,480
intellectual property and research

420
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,760
information so this all of a sudden

421
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:17,890
starts looking a lot more sort of

422
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:21,699
suspicious than what it really did

423
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:25,630
before so we call our boss up and say

424
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:28,990
you know we've found this stuff the team

425
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:31,210
want to work through it you're a bit

426
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:34,180
doubtful but you give them benefit of

427
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:36,370
doubt so two choices do we want to bring

428
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:38,470
in the big guns get company axe again

429
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:40,810
that's a you know your incident response

430
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:43,230
company or do you let the team work

431
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:46,330
through it and see what they can find so

432
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:54,990
let the team work through it waving like

433
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:58,530
this this time get a third party in hmm

434
00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:00,820
I've got deep pockets they're not pea

435
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:02,379
we're up here eating baked beans every

436
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:03,510
day and they're living on bloody dying

437
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:07,150
cat food

438
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:09,100
so as we go through the incident with

439
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:11,260
this third-party company it starts

440
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:12,540
looking you know the things are a bit

441
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:15,340
bigger than what we initially thought

442
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:17,350
they work with the team you find a bunch

443
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:20,470
of stuff and we slowly start remediating

444
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:22,240
it and getting on top of it as we get

445
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:25,240
towards the end of the investigation to

446
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,310
bring a long story short the third party

447
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,840
brings up a bunch of activities that we

448
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:31,720
should probably do to make sure that

449
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:35,919
things don't go wrong again the next

450
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:38,860
time we have an incident now of these

451
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:41,560
activities a number of them are

452
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:43,360
activities that the same company earlier

453
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,220
when we were doing a Nicholas Cage event

454
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,560
had come in and said they are all good

455
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:48,970
so they said they're all good we've had

456
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,480
an incident I've come back now and said

457
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:57,890
not it's not all good

458
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:59,540
rubbish oh thank you but having come out

459
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:01,970
of an incident you were doing awesome

460
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:04,428
this is awesome do you want a job I've

461
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:06,650
got a job anyway having come out of an

462
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:08,179
incident though cash whale is really

463
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:09,710
happy to start spending some money they

464
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:11,809
don't want to be in the paper again they

465
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:13,250
don't want you know John Travolta on

466
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:15,678
their website or anything like that

467
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:17,570
so we start off by implementing all the

468
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,640
stuff that you know company X has told

469
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:21,168
us to do we get some other stuff that

470
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:22,100
we've been sitting on for a while that

471
00:19:21,169 --> 00:19:23,809
you know they didn't want us to

472
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:25,820
implement and we start working on that

473
00:19:23,809 --> 00:19:33,290
and you know we start making a bit of

474
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:35,178
progression so unbeknownst to us cash

475
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:38,750
whales organized some sort of Red Team

476
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:40,309
exercise or something similar to be

477
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,380
conducted once we've finished the

478
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:43,610
remediation activities everything should

479
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:47,120
still be fresh in our minds so they

480
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:49,149
think that's a good time you and your

481
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,610
team start finding some of these

482
00:19:49,150 --> 00:19:55,100
indicators that something's going on and

483
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:58,399
you ask around and you know the IT guys

484
00:19:55,100 --> 00:20:00,740
yet again haven't seen anything they

485
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,260
think it's all good but your guys are

486
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:05,450
pretty sure something's going on so you

487
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:07,070
go and talk to your boss you say look

488
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:08,299
we've noticed this stuff it doesn't look

489
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:12,168
particularly malicious but it just

490
00:20:08,299 --> 00:20:14,510
doesn't look right it's a bit dodgy he

491
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:17,179
eventually comes clean and tells us that

492
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:18,890
you know something was going on or the

493
00:20:17,179 --> 00:20:20,000
red team exercise he's a little

494
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:21,740
disappointed that we didn't pick up

495
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,080
sooner because of all the other stuff to

496
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:25,760
them being going on and you decide

497
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:32,600
tomorrow's a really awesome day to have

498
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:34,370
a sickie which is why not so later on

499
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,080
down the path you and your team and your

500
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:37,309
boss you start having a bit of a few

501
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,320
meetings with the rest of the IT

502
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:42,350
function and you let them know what's

503
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,120
going on for everyone that's done a red

504
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:45,830
team activity or something a fairly

505
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,059
in-depth audit and pen test you know

506
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:48,830
that there's a lot of activities that

507
00:20:47,059 --> 00:20:50,629
always come out of these things these

508
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:54,350
guys love to find findings you know that

509
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:55,820
sort of stuff but you know they come up

510
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:59,360
with all these activities that need to

511
00:20:55,820 --> 00:21:00,740
be done and yet again we find that the

512
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,969
stuff that we've already done twice

513
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:05,190
we're doing again

514
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:07,180
we're starting to get a little bit sad

515
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:08,530
we're feeling like we're doing the same

516
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:11,460
thing over and over we feel like it's

517
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:14,260
Groundhog Day but that's the way it is

518
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:15,850
we know this is a game of catch-up we're

519
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,580
always going to be behind these guys

520
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:20,169
that are trying to attack us so you and

521
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:22,870
your team start putting in some sort of

522
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:25,320
like continual improvement program to

523
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:27,639
try and get one step ahead of these guys

524
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:29,980
but we know it's only a matter of time

525
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:37,300
before our next you know incident or

526
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:41,140
some sort of review oh yeah that night

527
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:42,820
you have a brainwave though and thank

528
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,560
you for reminding me because this is

529
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:47,139
what's going to save all of your jobs

530
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:50,290
this is the most important part of this

531
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:52,240
whole presentation I know I sound like a

532
00:21:50,290 --> 00:22:00,690
self-help guru and I feel like Britney

533
00:21:52,240 --> 00:22:03,520
Spears but I'm neither do it Red Rooster

534
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:07,500
you might ask why trader oyster why not

535
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,760
KFC why not Mack is on a Hungry Jack's

536
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,230
nobody goes to Red Rooster you can sit

537
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:17,200
and cook chips for a whole session and

538
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:21,430
no one will even talk to you but really

539
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,000
okay the next one the grass is always

540
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,740
greener

541
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,920
we always think someone's going to be

542
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:28,540
better this is one of my favorite

543
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,890
stories from feeling a bit down thinking

544
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:32,800
I can't do my job and I get a bit

545
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:34,420
annoyed I couldn't put the dudes photo

546
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:35,770
in here because he's a real-life Robin

547
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:38,350
Hood and he might be here because he's

548
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:39,790
you know from around here and if you are

549
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:42,310
here please introduce yourself to me

550
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:46,260
because you're cool but it turns out

551
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:48,490
that Red Rooster this sysadmin actually

552
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,990
had a pretty heated argument with his

553
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:51,670
boss over a safety issue

554
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:54,220
his boss didn't like him raising the

555
00:22:51,670 --> 00:22:56,020
safety issue and sacked him so you know

556
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,030
access control and all those other sort

557
00:22:56,020 --> 00:23:00,879
of security controls aside he went home

558
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:03,639
and got on to one of the chicken

559
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:06,160
ordering systems from one of the vendors

560
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:10,750
in fact he went to all of the vendors so

561
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:12,610
those three vendors he ordered it was

562
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:15,610
like a ton of chicken or something and

563
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:17,139
got it sent all to one Red Rooster

564
00:23:15,610 --> 00:23:19,639
franchise

565
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:21,500
how he could do that is beyond me

566
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:23,540
because who needs to order chicken from

567
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:26,360
home for work why he could do it is

568
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:27,740
beyond me but he could do it and then

569
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,689
when I'm really down and I think I'm

570
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:32,630
pretty rubbish at my job I read what his

571
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:33,680
lawyer said now the picture of him he

572
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:36,410
has got red hair

573
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,970
and so his lawyer was like hopefully

574
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:40,760
this is a single aberration in his life

575
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:43,070
you can see he's got red hair maybe it's

576
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,290
a function of that like who would say

577
00:23:43,070 --> 00:23:49,669
that and whose lawyer would say that

578
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:53,960
like that is just obscure but anyway we

579
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:56,780
can't all be that great thanks so on the

580
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,160
on the left my wife loves googling you

581
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:00,139
know when she's got an illness or

582
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:01,670
something and so when she does I always

583
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,050
send this to her so I just sneeze you

584
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:05,240
got cancer you stub your toe you got

585
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:07,669
cancer and security is the same right

586
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,770
like it sucks to be us no matter what we

587
00:24:07,670 --> 00:24:12,050
do no matter what happens in security in

588
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:16,610
the IT it always seems to lead to some

589
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:20,620
sort of breach you know we forget how

590
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:23,300
hard it is to be us some days you know

591
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:27,189
but there's surely something that we can

592
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,190
do to make this better for ourselves

593
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,900
we've got a stack of frameworks that can

594
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:34,639
help us limit the bad and you know none

595
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:36,170
of this next slot of stuff is going to

596
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,480
be new to you guys you've all seen it in

597
00:24:36,170 --> 00:24:42,640
one way shape or form but you know we

598
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:46,130
just have to have to be aware of it

599
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:49,910
we've got a term then this cyber

600
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:52,130
security framework this is absolutely

601
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:54,140
awesome to put up to your executive and

602
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:56,480
to your boards and stuff like that right

603
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:58,730
there you can make a dashboard and show

604
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,800
them how you're doing stuff so you know

605
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:02,450
you've got identify protect attack to

606
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,830
da-da-da-da-da then you've got all the

607
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:05,000
different activities you know asset

608
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,740
management and then you can break that

609
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,120
down so you can actually turn that into

610
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,280
a dashboard you can say percent

611
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,830
implemented percent effectiveness and

612
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,149
show them you know via a heat map of

613
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:16,520
what you're doing and they can

614
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:18,440
straightaway see we've got gaps in

615
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,210
detect or we can't recover or something

616
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:24,350
like that so this is always a really

617
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:27,560
good one I'm a big fan of that the CIS

618
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:30,050
20 controls the X sounds 20 critical

619
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:31,760
controls there is a winner

620
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:33,139
you know you've got your basic stuff

621
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,940
you've got your foundational stuff and

622
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,559
you've got your organizational stuff and

623
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:39,140
at the end of that they say you're X

624
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:42,580
percent better you know preventing

625
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,580
intrusions and all that sort of jazz

626
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:47,870
once we start getting a bit more mature

627
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:50,840
we can start using the mitre attack

628
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:52,550
framework so if someone does come in and

629
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:54,169
this is what they can do and for each of

630
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:56,419
those things that they can do it's got

631
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:58,580
remediation activities it's really good

632
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:59,600
it's pretty in-depth you don't need to

633
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,250
reinvent the wheel

634
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:05,199
they've already invented the wheel for

635
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:05,200
you that's a good one as well

636
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:09,379
we got the ASD essential eight we should

637
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:11,510
all know that you know there's you know

638
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:13,429
do these things and you'll help prevent

639
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:15,290
you know people getting into your

640
00:26:13,429 --> 00:26:16,700
network do these other things and you'll

641
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:22,190
limit what they can do once they're in

642
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:25,010
there that's a really good one this is

643
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:26,960
the cert New Zealand critical ten I

644
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:28,309
think they only release that either late

645
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,590
last year early this year but that's a

646
00:26:28,309 --> 00:26:32,330
good one as well making sure you got

647
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:33,678
multi-factor authentication default

648
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:34,909
credentials you know manage your cloud

649
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:39,410
authentication and all that sort of

650
00:26:34,910 --> 00:26:42,679
stuff and then probably one of the other

651
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:44,480
most overlooked thing is our users you

652
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:45,650
know they're probably a lot smarter and

653
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,410
a lot better than we give them credit

654
00:26:45,650 --> 00:26:49,820
for I guarantee the majority of your

655
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:51,050
users all use multi-factor

656
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:52,129
authentication on their Facebook

657
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:53,928
accounts their Twitter accounts

658
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:55,160
Instagram accounts their bank accounts

659
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:57,380
and all that sort of stuff but I

660
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:59,090
guarantee we all work for companies that

661
00:26:57,380 --> 00:27:00,740
will turn around to us and say we don't

662
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:03,159
want to put multi-factor in because the

663
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:09,110
users won't know how to use it I don't

664
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:11,390
get it but they do we also need to make

665
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:13,100
sure that you know these users we

666
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:16,040
empower them to be able to let us know

667
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:17,449
easily when something's going wrong if

668
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,280
they're seeing phishing emails in their

669
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:20,480
Outlook don't make them go through all

670
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,860
these hoops to report it give them a

671
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,540
little button and outlook so they can

672
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:25,520
click and go report phishing and then we

673
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:29,629
take how all the rest of it make it

674
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:32,840
harder for us than for them if they need

675
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:34,700
to report some sort of other issue give

676
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:37,699
them a way to light message you or text

677
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:39,169
you or do a simple form whatever it is

678
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:41,240
don't just give them the computer-based

679
00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:43,040
training don't just bore them let them

680
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:45,120
do all the hard lifting for you

681
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,889
and then the other thing is around

682
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:50,580
practicing so practice your incident

683
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:52,740
response practice it with everyone that

684
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,970
needs to be involved if you don't

685
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,060
practice it when it all goes to

686
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:58,350
pear-shape you can't do it

687
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:00,300
make sure that if you've got a cyber

688
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:03,810
incident you've practiced all the way

689
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:05,639
back up into business business critical

690
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,030
incident response plans and stuff like

691
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,680
that

692
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:10,889
make sure you've got those linkages

693
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:12,960
between them the last thing you want is

694
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:14,520
you know for an incident to happen and

695
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,920
for you to not be able to get it all the

696
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:18,629
way through you know your business

697
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,280
critical instant response plans or

698
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,840
whatever

699
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:23,370
if you've got msps make sure you

700
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,720
practice it with your MSPs as well

701
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:26,610
because you know there's nothing worse

702
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,380
than an internet happening you need to

703
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:29,879
use your MSPs you've never done this

704
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:31,200
with your MSP they don't know what you

705
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:36,120
expect you don't know what to get out of

706
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:38,760
them and it all goes to custard and if

707
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:40,500
all else fails you can always work at

708
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,240
Bunnings Warehouse where you can stand

709
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:43,980
in the plumbing section someone can ask

710
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,100
you for a brass plumbing fitting and you

711
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:50,940
can point them at the wood oil happen to

712
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:52,709
me on the weekend that's it for me we

713
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,390
sort of breeze through it and picks them

714
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:56,910
right choices

715
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:58,410

716
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:59,540

717
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:06,749

choose-your-own-adventure presentation

728

I've ever seen you know I came up with a

729
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,759
stupid idea and then it got picked and

730
00:29:35,169 --> 00:29:39,099
then I had to prove to I'd provide a

731
00:29:36,759 --> 00:29:42,879
stupid sorry it's not a stupid

732
00:29:39,099 --> 00:29:44,830
presentation but a stupid concept I
