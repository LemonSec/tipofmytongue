1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,460
right now we have Matthew pacaya and

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,200
Stephanie laws from Clayton Co talking

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:09,000
about the first 12 months of the

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,230
national data breach legislation and

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,179
what's changed how things have actually

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,650
gone on please hold your questions to

7
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:15,990
the end and if we've got time we'll have

8
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:19,289
them then thank you

9
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,810
thanks very much welcome everybody

10
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:23,160
I'll very briefly just outline what

11
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,570
we're going to go through and then we'll

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,330
get stuck into it cuz we've got a quite

13
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,160
a lot of material to get through Steph

14
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,538
is going to take us through the

15
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,729
Australian regulatory landscape in a

16
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,020
very brief way just as a refresher so it

17
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:37,140
puts sort of what's happened in the last

18
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:40,290
12 months in some context we'll look at

19
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,719
the key takeaways from the office of the

20
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,480
Australian Information Commissioner's

21
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:48,149
ndv scheme 12-month report this is the

22
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:49,860
sort of first real large data set we've

23
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,840
had a chance to have a look at as to how

24
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,090
the how the whole regime is working

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,100
we'll then look overseas we look towards

26
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,800
Europe and the GDP our statistics key

27
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,870
trends and misconceptions we'll look at

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,849
key trends arising from notifiable data

29
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,470
breach generally some comments and

30
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:08,159
response issues and privacy implications

31
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:14,490
that we've seen and then future future

32
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:17,189
trends and issues I thanks Matthew

33
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,500
just to recap them on some of the key

34
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:22,470
requirements under the NDB scheme

35
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:23,909
firstly who does it apply to well the

36
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,920
rule of thumb is that it applies to

37
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,930
Commonwealth government agencies and

38
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:29,700
organizations which have an annual

39
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:31,380
turnover of more than three million

40
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,150
dollars annually but do you remember

41
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,710
that some organizations that have an

42
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,479
annual turnover of less than that can

43
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:38,640
still be captured there are a number of

44
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,250
carve outs and the proxy acts that means

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,380
small businesses can be captured what to

46
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,869
investigate the number one question

47
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,360
we're asked is do I need to notify and

48
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:50,610
the answer is always well first we need

49
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,990
to understand has there been an eligible

50
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,240
data breach and you need to do that

51
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,789
assessment within 30 days there are

52
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:03,419
three key questions we go when in Italy

53
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:05,579
in reach I might just stand here sorry

54
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,840
to answer that question you really need

55
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:09,239
to look at has there been any

56
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,310
unauthorized access to or disclosure of

57
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:12,930
personal information and that's where

58
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:13,630
forensic vendors really assist us they

59
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,460
help us to

60
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,019
map out the path of the threat actor

61
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,370
whilst in the system so we understand

62
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,740
what personal information is being

63
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:23,140
affected the second question is is

64
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:24,400
serious harm likely the risk of harm

65
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:27,519
assessment is a really difficult

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,650
exercise so take for example an email

67
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,260
address our name may be considered to be

68
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:33,940
relatively benign information but if you

69
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:36,250
think of it in the context of an Ashley

70
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:38,200
Madison type of breach well in those

71
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:40,690
circumstances a name or an email address

72
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,630
would have a serious risk of harm

73
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:45,780
remember that harm includes not just

74
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:48,549
financial loss also emotional distress

75
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:50,650
the third question is can remedial

76
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:52,750
action be taken to prevent the likely

77
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,490
risk of serious harm in most cases

78
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,290
there's little that can be done to do

79
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:59,200
this threat actors have been in systems

80
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:01,720
for months before the incident is made

81
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,609
known to the organization I'm Betty for

82
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,990
example there's been a misdirected email

83
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:07,510
can you just pick up the phone

84
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:10,030
ask the recipient to delete the email in

85
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:13,359
those cases the likely risk of harm is

86
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:15,040
is removed when to notify you need to

87
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,230
notify as soon as practicable

88
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,760
this doesn't mean on day 30 of your

89
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:21,160
investigation but it means acting

90
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:22,780
quickly to notify once you've determined

91
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:26,380
that an eligible data breach has

92
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:28,300
occurred you need to notify the OIC and

93
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,340
affected individuals at risk of serious

94
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,740
harm and there are penalties under the

95
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,640
Act the upper limit is currently 2.1

96
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:35,230
million dollars

97
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,950
although the government's recently

98
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:40,570
introduced or proposed its intention to

99
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:42,670
bring in some tougher penalties so the

100
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:45,730
proposed amendments include an increase

101
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:48,010
in the maximum penalty from 2.1 to 10

102
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,079
million dollars or three times the value

103
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:52,510
of any benefit obtained through the use

104
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,250
of the information or ten percent of a

105
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:56,679
company's annual domestic turnover so

106
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:59,290
whichever is the greatest those proposed

107
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:02,170
changes will also be backed by increased

108
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:03,880
powers to the OAS e2 issue infringement

109
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:06,459
notices which will be backed by

110
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:08,470
penalties of up to 63,000 to companies

111
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:10,990
and twelve thousand six hundred dollars

112
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:12,880
for individuals who fail to cooperate

113
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:14,770
with efforts to resolve only minor data

114
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,140
breaches so notwithstanding those

115
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:18,760
proposed amendments the OIC in the last

116
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,409
12 months has really been adopting a

117
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,180
conciliatory approach in working with

118
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:24,040
entities that have been affected by data

119
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,540
breaches so we'll be monitoring with

120
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,460
some great interest over the next months

121
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,620
and year as to whether or not the

122
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,380
see might alter that stance and take a

123
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:33,310
harder stance

124
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:36,550
okay well let's have a look at what the

125
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:39,759
findings are of the last 12 months now

126
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:42,190
in total there have been 694 eligible

127
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,930
data breaches and on top of that there's

128
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,479
been a hundred and sixty-eight voluntary

129
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:49,030
notifications from 1 April last year

130
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,610
through to 31 March this year now that's

131
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:55,539
a whopping sort of 712 percent

132
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:58,539
uplift on notifications when compared to

133
00:04:55,539 --> 00:05:01,150
the previous 12 months it's worth noting

134
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:03,759
that the voluntary notifications capture

135
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:06,130
a class of notifications that either the

136
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,050
the organizations involved aren't caught

137
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:10,780
by the Privacy Act or the particular

138
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:13,300
breach doesn't meet the definition of an

139
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,559
eligible data breach and what the

140
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,080
Commission's doing in those

141
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,840
circumstances is it's not allowing the

142
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:22,060
the organization to remove the

143
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,030
notification it's it's merely recorded

144
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:28,150
as a note as a voluntary one now what

145
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:31,479
are the causes of data breaches 35

146
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:34,239
percent is pure human error 60 percent

147
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:37,449
is malicious or criminal attacks and 5

148
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,539
percent has been system failure now most

149
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:41,830
malicious or criminal attacks were

150
00:05:40,539 --> 00:05:43,180
attributed to vectors that you'd be very

151
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,969
familiar with phishing malware

152
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,409
ransomware brute-force attacks and

153
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,360
involve compromised or stolen

154
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:52,510
credentials and other forms of of

155
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,510
hacking these also of course involve in

156
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:57,909
a human element so the human element

157
00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:01,389
component of this is more than the 35

158
00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:04,630
percent referred to in many cases it's a

159
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:07,000
much larger number and in terms of the

160
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:08,729
sector's most impacted it's probably not

161
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,250
unsurprising to have that Health and

162
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:14,800
Finance reported them the most data

163
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:16,750
breaches the rate of human error was

164
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,300
also higher in both of those cases in

165
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:23,080
health the human error component was 55

166
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:26,650
percent not 35 and in finance it was 41

167
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:28,090
percent the level of which they're

168
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,250
reporting is probably not unsurprising

169
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:32,590
the Commission also notes that these are

170
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,330
two two sectors that record a lot of

171
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:36,760
personal data and sensitive personal

172
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,979
data they're more mature in their their

173
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,219
management of that data in there they're

174
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:45,890
more aware of when their breach

175
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:47,630
more likely to report it and the number

176
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:52,030
of individuals affected by breaches has

177
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:54,500
been relatively low in in 83% of cases

178
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:58,130
the number of individuals affected as

179
00:06:54,500 --> 00:07:00,560
being less than a thousand that's likely

180
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:03,590
because so many of these breaches

181
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,960
resulted from human error and in that

182
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:07,729
case a threat actor may have only gained

183
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,729
access to a single mailbox sort of a

184
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:13,430
single part of an organization so only

185
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:15,620
so many individuals were affected I mean

186
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:17,570
where you see I think the much larger

187
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:20,990
cases of very large numbers of

188
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:25,070
individuals impacted it's where you've

189
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:28,370
had sort of multiple breaches or and

190
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:29,630
where the organization involved is a

191
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:36,700
supplier to a number of other

192
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:40,219
organizations it's worth looking at the

193
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:41,570
regula of it so I think it's def now

194
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:46,010
looking at the type of information

195
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:49,430
involved in breaches the commissioners

196
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:52,460
report acknowledges that most of the

197
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:54,350
community is pretty much on on all fours

198
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,239
with the fact that serious financial

199
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:58,300
harm can result from credit card

200
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,260
information being stolen or from

201
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:02,360
identification information like passport

202
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:03,860
information health cards everyone's

203
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,620
pretty much aware that there can cause a

204
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:09,169
problem and can really cause some er

205
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:12,919
some serious harm there's less awareness

206
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:15,109
in in the Commission's view of the the

207
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:16,880
fact that just general contact

208
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:19,160
information can also lead to that sort

209
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,610
of harm and as we see on this graph

210
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:25,070
contact information is the largest

211
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:27,140
amount of largest form of information

212
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:31,159
that has being now that has been

213
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:32,990
accessed the OIC has really highlighted

214
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:35,240
the need for organisations to a sense

215
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:37,219
assess the potential Siri for serious

216
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:39,020
harm in the context of personal

217
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:41,659
information that's been involved in a

218
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:44,240
data breach now Steph was talking about

219
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:47,240
the fact that this simple information

220
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,810
can appear innocuous but if you in a

221
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:53,480
class of people who are quite vulnerable

222
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:55,399
someone who may be trying to avoid

223
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,959
their address being known is that a

224
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:58,279
contact because they're involved in like

225
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,439
criminal proceedings they may be a

226
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:04,279
protected witness it may be a spouse

227
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,660
trying to escape a violent spouse so in

228
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:08,870
those circumstances quite banal

229
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:13,069
information can lead to serious harm it

230
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:15,829
also of course in the hands of of threat

231
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:17,360
actors can improve their the

232
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:19,849
effectiveness of phishing attacks and

233
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,959
other social engineering attacks so it's

234
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,329
important to be conscious of the fact

235
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:28,489
that even even quite simple information

236
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:32,888
can lead to harm the average time to

237
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:35,389
notify the Oh AIC I mean that agree the

238
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:37,010
month by month it jumps around a bit but

239
00:09:35,389 --> 00:09:40,339
I think what you can see there is a

240
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:42,589
general trend a general increase why is

241
00:09:40,339 --> 00:09:45,230
that from our perspective what we're

242
00:09:42,589 --> 00:09:47,290
seeing is a complex attack vectors and

243
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,250
make meaning we've as Incident Response

244
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:52,000
Managers we're having to bring on

245
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:54,199
forensic people to have a closer look at

246
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,480
what systems have been accessed to have

247
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:58,459
how that's been done and what what sort

248
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,139
of data sets have been impacted and that

249
00:09:58,459 --> 00:10:02,660
takes time

250
00:10:00,139 --> 00:10:04,970
additionally that datasets involved the

251
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:07,880
more complex they can involve different

252
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:09,529
categories of individuals and they may

253
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,709
involve different communication

254
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:14,660
strategies in how you deal with a breach

255
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:17,060
so that that is also taking more time so

256
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:19,670
I think we can understand how that that

257
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:26,060
slow increase in time of of notification

258
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:28,550
is occurring the type of cyber incidents

259
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,750
that are occurring in all sectors it

260
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:32,359
probably comes as no surprise that

261
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:35,600
fishing and spearfishing at the most

262
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:37,040
common and highly effective methods by

263
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,430
which entities are being compromised

264
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,170
whether they're large or small threat

265
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:44,540
actors obviously typically used phishing

266
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,610
to elicit credentials usually a name or

267
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:49,250
password and gain access to the system

268
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:50,019
that way in many of the matters we're

269
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,130
dealing with

270
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:54,260
they've involved the use of the we

271
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:57,310
transfer phishing link which provided

272
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:59,959
subsequent access to clients office 365

273
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:02,869
accounts and out the whole environment

274
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:07,040
I mean after fishing the next most

275
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:09,140
prevalent cyber incident also involves

276
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,089
- credentials where the method of

277
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:13,910
compromise was not known by the entities

278
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:18,200
who would reporting so again we see this

279
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:19,370
real interest in in credentials the

280
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,830
Commission's of the view that this is

281
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:23,030
due to the growing prevalence of

282
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:24,410
credential stuffing and there's been

283
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:26,439
some reference to this in a number of

284
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:29,030
papers June of course at this conference

285
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:30,830
and in recent years huge troves of

286
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:34,490
confidential credentials have been

287
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:36,890
repeatedly posted online by hackers and

288
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:39,380
it's typically aggregated from previous

289
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:41,360
data breaches now this is working

290
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:44,210
because we're using people reuse

291
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,780
usernames and passwords across multiple

292
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:49,520
accounts so I think again we're seeing

293
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:52,040
that reflected in just the numbers from

294
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:53,660
the commissioners Jay - what these

295
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:57,620
threat actors are looking for and what

296
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:59,870
they've been harvesting we talked about

297
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:03,470
human error breaches being a critical

298
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:05,590
issue across all sectors I'm not going

299
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:07,640
to run through each of those elements

300
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,990
because I think they've they're pretty

301
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,480
obvious and you can you can you can have

302
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:12,860
a look at that yourself

303
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,450
what the only message I would take from

304
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:17,000
that is the importance of training in

305
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:19,640
the portance of Education - to reduce

306
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,800
the extent to which these sorts of these

307
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:23,500
sorts of breaches occur this is

308
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,939
certainly something the Commission's

309
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:29,720
referenced and has really highlighted

310
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:30,680
the need to attend to this now the

311
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,240
regulatory landscape

312
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:35,300
what's the regulator been doing from a

313
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,770
pure regulation perspective Steph had

314
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:39,319
mentioned in the area of penalties that

315
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:40,550
the Commissioner is taking a very soft

316
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,830
approach at first in a very conciliatory

317
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:44,329
approach um over the past 12 months

318
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:47,210
they've been really trying to drive

319
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:49,340
awareness of entities obligations and

320
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:50,990
the causes of data breaches and to

321
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:54,560
support better practices across

322
00:12:50,990 --> 00:12:57,070
industries now the OIC reports that

323
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,119
they'd be very happy with the

324
00:12:57,070 --> 00:13:01,460
organizational response to that they've

325
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:05,420
seen people quite prepared to engage

326
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:07,370
very proactively about it I suppose as a

327
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:09,229
result of that we've not seen any major

328
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:10,970
sort of enforcement activity by the

329
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:14,840
commission or penalties for failure to

330
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:16,280
comply with the NDB scheme there's an

331
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,920
ongoing discussion about how this

332
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:20,160
regulatory framework should should

333
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,589
should work

334
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,740
it oscillates between a carrot and stick

335
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:27,330
perspective the issue is you know

336
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:30,240
shouldn't really be managed by ongoing

337
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:33,030
collaboration between the community and

338
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:35,970
the Commission or should it take more of

339
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:37,500
a hard-line regulatory approach the

340
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,730
federal Commission has come down on the

341
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,100
side of saying well it sort of depends

342
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:43,380
it's it lies somewhere between both of

343
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,730
these approaches and the Commission's

344
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,600
said they want to work constructively

345
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:50,040
with organizations as they have to date

346
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,900
they want to you know do better

347
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:53,339
protocols and ways of responding to

348
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:56,850
breaches and they're going to take a

349
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:59,370
proportion at an evidence-based attitude

350
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,840
to regulatory action but they will be

351
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:03,390
exercising regulatory and enforcement

352
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:06,270
powers where necessary I mean the

353
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:08,130
increase in penalties signals from some

354
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:10,590
lists to some extent a signal from

355
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:12,900
government as what do they expect the

356
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:14,610
regulator's to do we've seen criticism

357
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:17,189
in the financial industry of regulators

358
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:19,200
so I think the Commission well-being

359
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:21,240
while being a fairly touchy-feely at

360
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:24,320
this stage we'll be prepared to reach

361
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:27,120
for the tools if they feel they need to

362
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,370
the OIC also has power to conduct an

363
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,840
investigation where they're serious

364
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:33,510
concerns about many of these compliance

365
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:35,430
with the privacy principles we haven't

366
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:37,830
seen this in practices yet but I think

367
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:42,510
this is a mechanism they will turn to

368
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:45,060
over the next few years in one case the

369
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:47,730
Commission has reported that it's issued

370
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,810
a direction to compel notification where

371
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,880
it uncovered a failure to notify

372
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:53,219
individuals it's also reported

373
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:55,470
conducting regulatory inquiries to

374
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:57,180
ensure the breaches were contained and

375
00:14:55,470 --> 00:15:00,090
rectified and that measures were

376
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:01,770
implemented to prevent reoccurrence so

377
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,990
it is taking some regular activity it's

378
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:05,360
just being pretty soft about that at the

379
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:07,770
present time

380
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,690
one thing the Commission is focused on

381
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:12,360
and we're seeing a little bit of this

382
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:15,030
reflected globally is the whole issue of

383
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:18,150
consents provided by individuals to use

384
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:20,630
their personal information organization

385
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:24,600
organize the patient's need to make it

386
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:25,920
easier for individuals to understand the

387
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,800
terms and conditions that are associated

388
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:30,420
with those consents and this is

389
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,370
obviously very relevant in the social

390
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,880
media environment it was reflected in

391
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:37,120
the Cambridge analytical matter

392
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:39,790
in July last year we'll and since that

393
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:42,970
time we've seen a representative action

394
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:45,430
launched under the Privacy Act on behalf

395
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:49,029
of over 300,000 Australian Facebook

396
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:51,310
users yeah you will all be aware I think

397
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:53,529
of the this involve the harvesting by a

398
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:56,560
third party of over 50 million Facebook

399
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:59,709
users data to use in election

400
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,680
campaigning the thing that I suppose

401
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:04,060
concerns us as lawyers in this issue is

402
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:06,370
there's not been any value if you like

403
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:09,040
set upon your personal information if

404
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:10,389
it's been used in this context what the

405
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:13,719
complainants trying to do in this case

406
00:16:10,389 --> 00:16:15,509
is say that $10,000 is a nice number for

407
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,420
what someone should be compensated for

408
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:21,190
if they lose if someone uses their data

409
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,589
in this way and it would be very good

410
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,930
deterrent for anyone who misuses the

411
00:16:23,589 --> 00:16:27,459
data in that way of course the bill for

412
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:30,130
that would be three billion dollars if

413
00:16:27,459 --> 00:16:31,779
this gets up so we're watching that very

414
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:36,689
closely the Commission's well advanced

415
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:36,689
in that and we'll see what comes of it

416
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:41,620
the 12-month report has provided some

417
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:43,060
best practice tips and when the

418
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:46,500
commissioner gives tips it's always a

419
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:49,258
good idea to take good notice of them

420
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:52,779
we've already alluded to the fact that

421
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:54,699
you know a human error is a major source

422
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:56,819
of breaches so it comes as no surprise

423
00:16:54,699 --> 00:16:58,990
that training is a critical element

424
00:16:56,819 --> 00:17:02,229
staff need to be trained to protect

425
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:05,109
their devices and their accounts they

426
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:07,179
must also understand how to detect and

427
00:17:05,109 --> 00:17:09,579
report email based threats phishing

428
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:11,980
phishing being such a major part of data

429
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:14,230
breaches and understand basic account of

430
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,789
security and there's been some

431
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:18,809
discussion about passwords at its

432
00:17:15,789 --> 00:17:20,949
conference and that's an advancing area

433
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:22,589
preventative technologists knowledge

434
00:17:20,949 --> 00:17:25,020
ease and processes are essential

435
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:27,819
investing in better security measures

436
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,500
the Commission refers to multi-factor

437
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:31,750
authentication is something that should

438
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:34,020
be used in conjunction with other other

439
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:37,480
education in mitigation against

440
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:39,330
compromised credentials encryption and

441
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:42,370
secure data transfer for everyday

442
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:44,470
communications other enhanced security

443
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:47,439
measures might include capture an

444
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:49,210
identity verification checks

445
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:52,900
it's very important to proactively

446
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:54,700
monitor systems and organizations really

447
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:57,760
need to review that data it's quite

448
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,800
important that you minimize the data you

449
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,940
take and if you don't collect data or

450
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:06,250
maintain data that you don't really need

451
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:08,680
being prepared is always important do

452
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,480
you have a data breach manager no breach

453
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,340
response plan in place and has it been

454
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,190
tested the Commission certainly expects

455
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:17,350
that you will at an a minimum it should

456
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:20,230
provide practical guidance on how to

457
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:22,929
respond to and reduce the impact of a

458
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:25,600
breach and to meet the obligations under

459
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:28,780
the NDB scheme and support individuals

460
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:30,909
to reduce harm and it's important

461
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:33,910
obviously to have regular practices and

462
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:37,780
exercises or data breach simulations to

463
00:18:33,910 --> 00:18:39,700
make sure that plants working assessment

464
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,139
of harm is critical I mentioned before

465
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:43,720
it's important to know your doubt and

466
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,360
not click what you don't need but it's

467
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:47,350
also important to do some data mapping

468
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,600
so you ensure you're able to make a

469
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:52,209
prompt thorough assessment of a breach

470
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,860
that occurs most organizations should

471
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:55,510
have the capacity to have some awareness

472
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:59,919
of what harm may be suffered if that

473
00:18:55,510 --> 00:19:01,570
data is is breached and it certainly

474
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,430
entities that understand their data best

475
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:06,520
a best place to assess whether it's

476
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:07,930
notifiable or not post breach

477
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,710
communication is something that

478
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:14,110
Commissioner has focused on a bit it

479
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:16,540
needs to put the individual first I me

480
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:19,300
it's too much of this can be quite

481
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:20,830
defensive it should can communicate in

482
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:22,840
plain English and provide practical

483
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:25,990
information that helps people actually

484
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,580
mitigate harm the Commissioner reports

485
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:29,200
the consumers respond obviously most

486
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:31,360
favorably when it provides them with

487
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,700
practical and real solutions and so that

488
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,669
can be a bit of a PR win for any

489
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:38,500
organization that's breached it might be

490
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:40,960
necessary to structure your notification

491
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:42,400
campaign such the different categories

492
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,280
of affected individuals are treated

493
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,010
differently that's particularly the case

494
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:50,980
with vulnerable individuals there might

495
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:54,040
be children elderly people they look at

496
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:55,300
the quite a broad range of those also

497
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,220
and this is a very practical thing

498
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,470
consider the impact of timing of the

499
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:01,030
notification the Commission's warned

500
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:03,130
against issuing notifications

501
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:06,340
on a Friday afternoon or just before a

502
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:07,870
public holiday where you get to really

503
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:09,220
raise someone's stress levels and create

504
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:10,719
panic but there's really not much anyone

505
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:13,180
can do about it over the next few days

506
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:17,890
it's being sort of considerate and

507
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:20,470
practical about that approach now

508
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:21,910
looking at some key takeaways how

509
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,650
minimisation I've talked about that

510
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:27,330
before I probably can't say enough about

511
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:29,740
that issue the Commission expects

512
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:32,710
organizations to put individuals first

513
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:35,890
so communicate plainly and provide help

514
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:38,110
and mitigating calm navigating

515
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:39,270
multi-party breaches has become a bit of

516
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:41,560
a challenge there's been some confusion

517
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:44,379
associated with this there needs to be

518
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:46,659
more coordination you can have multiple

519
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:49,330
entities who look after people's data or

520
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:51,610
no breach occurs who notifies well the

521
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:53,139
simple answer is it's the entity with

522
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:55,030
the most direct relationship with the

523
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:57,700
affected individuals should do the

524
00:20:55,030 --> 00:21:00,639
notification by well a way of

525
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,560
illustration in a page no matter which

526
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,530
happened quite recently the Commission

527
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:07,210
received more than 50 notifications from

528
00:21:05,530 --> 00:21:08,530
page up and its corporate clients in

529
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:12,280
relation to that incident so that's a

530
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:15,129
huge sort of a huge administrative task

531
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:17,020
and can create some confusion was if you

532
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:19,290
have coordination with the party who

533
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:22,330
notifies it works much more smoothly

534
00:21:19,290 --> 00:21:25,210
it's also important for organizations to

535
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:27,340
be aware of the thresholds across other

536
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:30,490
jurisdictions because these breaches can

537
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:32,770
cross borders and there needs to be a

538
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:35,260
focus on if you're doing work in Europe

539
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:37,120
with the GDP our requirements are and

540
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:43,300
also throughout Southeast Asia there are

541
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:45,850
different regimes it's difficult now

542
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:48,100
take us through Europe its Matthew so

543
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:50,590
happy first birthday to the gdpr it's

544
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:52,629
been 12 months since the GDP our first

545
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:55,270
came into effect and so there's been

546
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:58,300
some lessons learnt over the last 12

547
00:21:55,270 --> 00:22:00,430
months but just to quickly recap on some

548
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:02,530
of the key requirements under the GDP

549
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:03,820
are I'm sure many of you will be aware

550
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,470
of these but it'll be helpful to give

551
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:08,800
context to the examples I go through

552
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:10,660
later of course the general data

553
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:14,020
protection regulation in the European

554
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:14,980
Union thank you for that question I hope

555
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,379
there are other

556
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:19,360
the room that are aware - there are

557
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:21,190
tougher penalties certainly under the

558
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,500
GDP are there are fines of up to 20

559
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:26,050
million euro or 4% of annual global

560
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:28,780
turnover mandatory notification is also

561
00:22:26,050 --> 00:22:31,360
a requirement so organizations are

562
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:34,889
required to notify regulators within 72

563
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:38,110
hours and to affected individuals with

564
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:40,390
undue delay there needs to be a lawful

565
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:44,409
basis for processing data and this is a

566
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:47,290
key issue under the GD P R so there are

567
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:48,940
six lawful basis for processing data we

568
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:50,590
usually hear a lot about consent but

569
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:53,110
there are five others that you can

570
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:54,850
consider so those include where there's

571
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:56,770
a requirement to fulfil or prepare a

572
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:58,659
contract where there's a legal

573
00:22:56,770 --> 00:23:00,760
obligation where there's a vital

574
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:03,670
interest so in a medical situation for

575
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:05,440
example where there's an necessity to

576
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:07,470
carry out a public function and where

577
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,910
there's some other legitimate interest

578
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:12,100
individual rights are also enhanced

579
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:14,560
under the GD P R so those rights include

580
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:16,620
the right to be forgotten the right to

581
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,179
data Portability and the right to access

582
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:21,580
the accountability accountability

583
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:23,200
principles also been introduced that's a

584
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:25,990
new data protection principle that

585
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,730
simply requires organizations to take

586
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:29,710
responsibility for the data that they

587
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:31,900
hold and to be able to demonstrate

588
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:34,330
compliance with the GD P R so if you're

589
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:36,810
taking steps to comply with the GD P I

590
00:23:34,330 --> 00:23:39,429
now make sure you're documenting that

591
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:41,950
privacy by design is also are now

592
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:43,450
required under the GD P R and there's a

593
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:45,840
new definition for consent

594
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:47,920
so it requires positive opt-in and

595
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,350
explicit consent for sensitive

596
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:52,810
categories of data if you're relying on

597
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:54,820
consent as a precondition of service out

598
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:57,220
then in those circumstances it's not

599
00:23:54,820 --> 00:24:00,520
likely to be the best lawful basis for

600
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:04,270
processing data so where are we 12

601
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:07,629
months in 89,000 data breach

602
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:11,260
notifications have been logged to the EU

603
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:13,210
regulators 144,000 queries and

604
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:15,340
complaints have been reported but that

605
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:17,560
really just confirms the perceived rise

606
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:20,500
and awareness around data protection

607
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:23,020
rights more generally as to penalties

608
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:26,470
eleven of the EU regulators have issued

609
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:28,840
fines totaling around 56 million euros

610
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:30,760
but do keep in mind that that figure in

611
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:33,120
clewd the 50 million fine that was

612
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:36,010
issued to Google in January this year

613
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,908
some regulators have been more active

614
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:38,529
than others

615
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:40,029
the French regulator has been

616
00:24:38,529 --> 00:24:41,559
particularly active but that's likely

617
00:24:40,029 --> 00:24:44,529
because it's hard to deal with google

618
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:46,029
and has issued the fine there the UK

619
00:24:44,529 --> 00:24:47,890
information commission has also been

620
00:24:46,029 --> 00:24:49,029
particularly active but a lot of the

621
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:50,380
commentary that we're seeing at the

622
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:52,600
moment is around fines and penalties

623
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:54,730
that were issued under the Data

624
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:56,439
Protection Act which precedes the gdpr

625
00:24:54,730 --> 00:24:57,779
so the ICO actually has a massive

626
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:02,740
backlog they're looking at

627
00:24:57,779 --> 00:25:05,200
investigations from 2017 still I think

628
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:06,610
last week they brought their first

629
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,950
action under the gdpr

630
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:10,479
and that was against the UK tax

631
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:12,909
authority and they ordered them to

632
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,559
delete 5 million voice records that

633
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:16,559
they'd collected without valid consent

634
00:25:16,830 --> 00:25:22,059
just some key trends under the GDP are

635
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,340
that have been identified by the key

636
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:26,139
regulators the French regulators

637
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:28,178
experiencing a number of complaints

638
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:30,039
relating to the right to be forgotten so

639
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:34,450
a number of people are making a request

640
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:36,279
to have their URLs delisted any names

641
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:39,210
contact details or photographs also

642
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:41,950
removed from the internet the irish

643
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:44,289
regulator has also experienced a number

644
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:45,909
of complaints around the access issue so

645
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:48,340
a lot of those complaints might involve

646
00:25:45,909 --> 00:25:51,059
where an organisation has taken too long

647
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:53,439
to respond to a request for information

648
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:54,039
there's a 30-day time frame under the

649
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:59,110
gdpr

650
00:25:54,039 --> 00:26:01,779
and there's also some popular use of the

651
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:05,770
right to data portability by bank

652
00:26:01,779 --> 00:26:07,510
customers so what have we learned from

653
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:11,379
the fines and penalties that have been

654
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:13,750
issued over the last 12 months firstly

655
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:16,390
and this is really no surprise but quick

656
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:19,690
response and notification will help to

657
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:22,510
reduce fines so in Germany last year the

658
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:25,000
personal data of approximately 300,000

659
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:26,590
social media users which included their

660
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:29,260
passwords and email addresses were

661
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:30,879
compromised no surprise that the users

662
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:33,460
passwords in this case were in

663
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,470
unencrypted form and the regulator said

664
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:37,600
that this is a violation of your

665
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:40,659
obligation to implement adequate

666
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:42,219
security measures however in this case

667
00:26:40,659 --> 00:26:46,270
the regulator in Peru

668
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:48,190
a reduced fine of 220,000 euro on the

669
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:50,320
basis that there was quick notification

670
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:52,450
to the regulator and that data subjects

671
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,158
were also notified quickly and because

672
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:56,950
there was cooperation by the

673
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,049
organisation in responding to the

674
00:26:56,950 --> 00:27:02,260
regulator's recommendations within weeks

675
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:04,780
of the breach occurring a secondly

676
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:06,580
deliberate conduct will likely result in

677
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:09,158
high fines so Google's a case in point

678
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:11,379
here to recap on that matter

679
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:13,480
the French regulator find Google 50

680
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:16,179
million euro for collecting personal

681
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:18,340
data from users without providing an

682
00:27:16,179 --> 00:27:20,590
adequate level of transparency on how

683
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:22,959
that data would be used for personalised

684
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:24,879
advertisements Google actually appealed

685
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,549
this decision in February and that's

686
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,039
really no surprise it's a big fine but

687
00:27:27,549 --> 00:27:31,990
they said that they had worked hard to

688
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:34,330
create a transparent and straightforward

689
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:36,789
approach to consent and they said that

690
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:38,830
consents actually really easy to give no

691
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:41,049
surprise that the French regulator did

692
00:27:38,830 --> 00:27:42,879
not agree with that assessment and they

693
00:27:41,049 --> 00:27:44,950
said no it doesn't comply because it's

694
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,409
not specific and it's unambiguous and

695
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:51,190
the consent for personalized ads it's a

696
00:27:47,409 --> 00:27:53,320
checkbox and it's ticked by default so

697
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:55,510
the French regulator also said that

698
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:57,908
Google had buried its its policy around

699
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:59,320
this issue amongst other terms and

700
00:27:57,909 --> 00:28:00,970
conditions so you had to click through a

701
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:03,610
number of pages before you had any

702
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:06,789
understanding of how your data was being

703
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:08,678
used to personalize ads it's a case to

704
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:10,840
watch because we probably won't see a

705
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:12,330
decision from the European Court of

706
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:14,918
Justice for another six to twelve months

707
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:18,520
so something to watch to see whether or

708
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:20,470
not that fine actually sticks mistake or

709
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:22,000
ignorance has no bearing on the fines

710
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:24,640
that will be issued a hospital in

711
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,679
Portugal was fined four hundred thousand

712
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:28,600
euro because its account management

713
00:28:26,679 --> 00:28:30,730
practices were deficient so it had

714
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,530
almost a thousand active accounts but

715
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:35,289
only three hundred doctors working for

716
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:37,330
it any doctor had access to all patient

717
00:28:35,289 --> 00:28:39,490
files irrespective of their speciality

718
00:28:37,330 --> 00:28:41,649
and the hospital said in that case that

719
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:43,450
we're not responsible for this because

720
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:46,360
all we've done is simply employed the

721
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:48,840
same IT system that's been implemented

722
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:52,059
by all public hospitals in Portugal and

723
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:54,039
the Portuguese regulator said no it's

724
00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:55,960
it's your responsibility the hospital's

725
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:57,310
sole responsibility to ensure

726
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:59,200
that they have adequate security

727
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:00,970
measures in place they couldn't point

728
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,520
the finger and rely on the public system

729
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:07,480
it really needed to take responsibility

730
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:10,990
for its own systems attempting to avoid

731
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:14,230
large costs for non-compliance is a big

732
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:17,020
no case in point a Polish marketing and

733
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:19,240
analytics company was fined two hundred

734
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:22,930
and twenty thousand euro after it failed

735
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:25,750
to notify six million data subjects on

736
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:28,570
the basis that to do so would have cost

737
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:30,130
eight million euro so their their

738
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:32,950
position was that they'd have to notify

739
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:33,940
these people by post or by telephone and

740
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:37,090
the cost of doing that were

741
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:39,370
disproportionate and they had notified

742
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:42,070
those data subjects for whom they had an

743
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:44,770
email address but the Polish regulator

744
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:46,659
said that in this case your infringement

745
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:48,730
of the gdpr it's intentional you know

746
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:50,410
what your obligations are and so in

747
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:52,510
those circumstances it did impose a

748
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:55,060
larger fine than would have otherwise

749
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:56,680
been the case and finally our data

750
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:58,810
subjects have a heightened awareness of

751
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:00,940
their individual rights under the GD P R

752
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:02,169
that's no surprise given what types of

753
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:03,880
complaints the regulators are

754
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:05,320
experiencing at the moment that focus on

755
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:07,590
access rights and the right to be

756
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,590
forgotten

757
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:12,250
territorial scope on the GD P R is still

758
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:14,290
an issue that Australian organizations

759
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:15,280
are really grappling with and that's no

760
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:17,830
surprise

761
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:19,810
somewhat helpfully the European Data

762
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:22,570
Protection Board released some draft

763
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:24,610
guidelines at the end of last year they

764
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:26,320
were open for public consultation until

765
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:28,240
January this year so we expect to see

766
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:30,310
the final version released sometime soon

767
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,700
but there are some key takeaways to take

768
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:35,550
from those draft guidelines firstly the

769
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,350
fact that an Australian organisation

770
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:41,200
doesn't have a branch or a subsidiary in

771
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:43,060
the EU doesn't preclude it from having

772
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,190
an establishment that within the meaning

773
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:46,960
of the GD P R so there's a threshold

774
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:48,940
test for determining this and that's

775
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,380
whether or not there's a stable

776
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:52,750
arrangement in place so in some

777
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:54,790
circumstances a single employee or agent

778
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:56,680
of the Australian entity may be

779
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:59,260
sufficient to constitute a stable

780
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:03,400
arrangement but it can't be too broad so

781
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:05,440
an Australian in certainty that simply

782
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,180
has its website accessible by people in

783
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:09,970
the EU won't be enough to satisfy the

784
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:13,090
test the requirement that

785
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:15,610
subjects be located in the EU that issue

786
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:17,620
must be assessed at the moment when the

787
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:19,209
relevant trigger activity takes place so

788
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,739
at the moment of the offering of goods

789
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,810
or services or the moment at which the

790
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:24,640
behaviors been monitored so what's

791
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:27,750
relevant is a stage at which you're

792
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:29,740
collecting their data and third the

793
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:31,990
processing personal data of an

794
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:34,090
individual in the EU alone is not

795
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:36,940
sufficient to trigger the application of

796
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:38,800
the gdpr to Australian organisations

797
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:40,630
that aren't established there so there

798
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,490
needs to be an element of targeting the

799
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:44,440
individual so if an Australian citizen

800
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:47,290
is is travelling through Europe on

801
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:49,090
holiday and downloads an Australian news

802
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:51,700
app for example and the app is

803
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:53,649
exclusively directed to Australian the

804
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:55,300
Australian market then in those

805
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:58,650
circumstances the Australian company

806
00:31:55,300 --> 00:32:01,930
won't be captured there are a number of

807
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:04,420
misconceptions under the GDP are are the

808
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:06,430
first which I touched on before which is

809
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:08,500
it consent is the only lawful basis for

810
00:32:06,430 --> 00:32:11,260
processing data there are five other

811
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:13,990
lawful basis for processing data so no

812
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:16,090
single one is better than the next but

813
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:17,890
whichever one you decide to adopt you

814
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:21,580
really need to incorporate that into

815
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:24,430
your privacy policy breaches will result

816
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:26,830
in huge fines not really the case the

817
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:29,530
fund that's been issued to Google is the

818
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:31,929
highest yet but it's only 0.5% of

819
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:33,850
Google's global annual turnover we're

820
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:36,250
also seeing some fines are at the lower

821
00:32:33,850 --> 00:32:40,449
end of the scale so the Austrian DPA

822
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:43,720
issued a 4,800 euro fine last year for

823
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:45,670
monitoring a public space without proper

824
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:48,100
transparency because video surveillance

825
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:50,590
hadn't been adequately marked small

826
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,510
businesses are exempt not true there's

827
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:55,120
no monetary threshold like there is

828
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:57,340
under the Privacy Act and all businesses

829
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,290
require a Data Protection Officer again

830
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,760
that's not the case a number of small

831
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:02,740
businesses may be exempt from that

832
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:04,900
requirement you're only required to have

833
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:06,970
one where your public authority or where

834
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:09,280
your core activities involve a large

835
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:11,230
scale or systematic monitoring of

836
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,730
individuals or all processing of special

837
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:17,320
categories of data like criminal

838
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:19,540
criminal convictions and offences now

839
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:21,790
just on to some key trends that we've

840
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:23,260
identified from the matters that we've

841
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:25,659
been involved in in the Australia

842
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:27,940
in space the first of which is a number

843
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:30,520
of organizations prematurely notifying

844
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:32,290
the OIC and this can cause some some

845
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,850
major issues down the line but what

846
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:36,190
we're finding is as before we're

847
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:37,600
appointed an organization is concerned

848
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:39,610
about the timeframe under the Act which

849
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,560
they should be they notify before

850
00:33:39,610 --> 00:33:42,459
completing an adequate forensic

851
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,129
investigation

852
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:47,260
the forensic vendor comes in and has a

853
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:49,300
look and decides actually there's been

854
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:51,700
no unauthorized access to personal

855
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:53,200
information so in those cases there's

856
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:59,770
been no need to make a notification

857
00:33:53,200 --> 00:34:02,590
under the arcs probably referred to this

858
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:04,330
earlier is deficient notification

859
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:07,300
notifications that aren't handle very

860
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:09,299
well sort of happening on about a bit

861
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:11,168
but the effective risk of humm

862
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:14,080
management and assessment is one of the

863
00:34:11,168 --> 00:34:16,089
key areas a notification that can't

864
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:19,409
provide some guidance about potential

865
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:21,520
harm is a deficient notification

866
00:34:19,409 --> 00:34:25,300
notifications that don't adequately

867
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:27,250
provide pathways for effective actions

868
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:29,740
for individuals aren't very useful and

869
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:31,389
those that are emotive and using or

870
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:32,830
blaming of other parties rather than

871
00:34:31,389 --> 00:34:35,500
just sort of shouldering the blame and

872
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:37,149
moving on with solutions I've also

873
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:40,600
referred to dual notifications and the

874
00:34:37,149 --> 00:34:42,159
importance to notify if you're the party

875
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:45,549
that has the most direct relationship

876
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:47,530
with the individuals impacted certainly

877
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:49,570
some confusion around compliance so a

878
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:51,490
number of organizations that are in fact

879
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:53,590
captured by the Privacy Act aren't

880
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:55,029
complying we're also noticing with a lot

881
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:57,250
of ransomware incidents that the

882
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:59,290
organization focuses on getting things

883
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:01,240
back to normal looking at business

884
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:03,340
interruption losses but they fail to

885
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,720
consider a what level of access they met

886
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:06,010
there may have been before the

887
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,359
ransomware was deployed

888
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:11,470
so something to think about in those

889
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:13,420
cases this is an ancillary point but

890
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:15,040
there's no sort of regulation that comes

891
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:17,380
into effect that doesn't create work for

892
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:19,900
lawyers and this is no different

893
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:22,150
recoveries are something we're seeing

894
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:24,160
becoming a factor where there are

895
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:26,320
actions against IT vendors who fail to

896
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:28,720
identify vulnerabilities for example in

897
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:30,730
a system that's led to a data breach or

898
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,529
whether this felt whether they fail to

899
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:34,750
properly backup systems so after it

900
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:36,910
ransomware attack or whatever then it's

901
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:39,730
been costly to put the company

902
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:41,170
in place where it was before whistling a

903
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:43,299
lot more litigation around that I think

904
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:44,829
we'll see a lot more it usually follows

905
00:35:43,299 --> 00:35:47,200
a data breach but it's something to keep

906
00:35:44,829 --> 00:35:49,450
in mind we're certainly seeing the

907
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,669
longtail claims risk arising from data

908
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:52,779
breach notification so individuals that

909
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:54,309
have been affected is seeking

910
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,690
compensation they're making complaints

911
00:35:54,309 --> 00:35:58,030
they're asking questions about you

912
00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:00,339
information security practices we're

913
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:02,200
also seeing a lot of third parties

914
00:36:00,339 --> 00:36:04,509
making Freedom of Information requests

915
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:06,189
to the OIC in relation to a notifiable

916
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,750
data breach so that's something that

917
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:11,289
we're dealing with on a day to day basis

918
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:13,299
also and the issue of cyber insurance is

919
00:36:11,289 --> 00:36:15,490
an important one it forms a part of a

920
00:36:13,299 --> 00:36:19,030
lot of organizations answer to cyber

921
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:20,799
threats in the utilization of that

922
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:23,170
insurance cover we've seen a few issues

923
00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:25,240
our failure to notify insurers early on

924
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:27,760
often these policies provide quite

925
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:29,709
effective assistance immediately after a

926
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,900
data breach has occurred and that's not

927
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:33,490
always being well utilized it's

928
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:36,000
important as an organization to know

929
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:38,529
what your cyber insurance cover provides

930
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,089
there are very different wordings social

931
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:42,250
engineering is included in some it's

932
00:36:40,089 --> 00:36:44,650
excluded in others and when you see that

933
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:46,900
see the the the amount of phishing

934
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:49,599
that's occurring and other social

935
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:51,010
engineering attacks you know you've got

936
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:53,440
to make a judgment of whether that's

937
00:36:51,010 --> 00:36:56,440
important to the organization and

938
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:59,260
certainly there's increasing complex

939
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:01,630
data breaches so office 365 attacks

940
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:04,000
whilst the attack vector might not be

941
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:05,589
overly complex what is difficult is

942
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,569
working through the personal information

943
00:37:05,589 --> 00:37:09,609
that's been affected so looking at say

944
00:37:07,569 --> 00:37:10,960
for example five mailboxes that have

945
00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:15,130
been affected which categories of

946
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,750
individuals do we need to notify I won't

947
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:18,250
go through these slides but I understand

948
00:37:16,750 --> 00:37:20,349
you'll receive a copy of them so they're

949
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:23,079
just some key points around some issues

950
00:37:20,349 --> 00:37:24,660
we've identified in BC incidents and

951
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:27,549
also in ransomware

952
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:29,049
how can you prepare I don't propose

953
00:37:27,549 --> 00:37:31,089
going through this either I think I'll

954
00:37:29,049 --> 00:37:32,650
be preaching to the choir here and I'm

955
00:37:31,089 --> 00:37:35,710
sure a number of you are already well

956
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:38,140
advanced in these issues our future

957
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:39,880
trends and issues there's certainly some

958
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:42,279
changes to legislation which I touched

959
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,990
on before under the Privacy Act there's

960
00:37:42,279 --> 00:37:46,240
a new upper standard which will commence

961
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:49,029
in July which will require upper

962
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:50,799
irregular entities to notify APRA within

963
00:37:49,029 --> 00:37:55,450
72 hours of

964
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:57,100
identifying a breach changes in attack

965
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:57,970
vectors are something we need to keep an

966
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:59,830
eye on it

967
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:01,540
threat actors are always getting better

968
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:04,000
at this phishing attacks have become

969
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:07,960
more more sophisticated and harder -

970
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:09,520
harder - - to detect so that's something

971
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:14,140
it's just keeping in touch with the

972
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:15,970
whole development of attack for

973
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:17,920
structure risks that's something to

974
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:19,540
watch the us experiences that thread

975
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,940
actors are certainly looking at this

976
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:23,380
area now we've seen what what's happened

977
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:25,540
in Ukraine where threat actors have been

978
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:28,210
looking at wiping out our energy grids

979
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:30,940
so something to watch a is going to

980
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:32,500
become an increasing issue and with AI

981
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:34,390
the whole consent model we've been

982
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:36,040
talking about when you can send to your

983
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:38,710
individual information your personal

984
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:40,450
information being used you know in an AI

985
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:42,190
environment do you know how that's going

986
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:44,439
to be used sometimes the organizations

987
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:46,390
that are using it don't know so we can

988
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:48,930
see maybe that consent model will change

989
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:51,879
and that'll be addressed over time

990
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:54,669
individual rights to privacy unlike in

991
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:57,070
the US or the UK we currently have no

992
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:59,920
tort of privacy in the common law in

993
00:38:57,070 --> 00:39:01,750
Australia but that possibility of it

994
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,280
occurring could change particularly

995
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:06,220
having regard to the current case law

996
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:07,420
around the issue so if that happens then

997
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:10,029
there's a possibility of civil

998
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:12,100
litigation based on an accepted tort of

999
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:14,920
privacy so that will represent a

1000
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:16,360
significantly new risk to Australian

1001
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:19,540
organisations that are affected by a

1002
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:22,570
breach surveillance in use of CCTV has

1003
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:23,950
been a hot issue in Europe the

1004
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:25,450
Queensland Law Reform Commission is

1005
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:28,540
currently looking at that very issue

1006
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:30,850
here and wrote a undertaking a review of

1007
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:32,800
surveillance laws both in the civil seer

1008
00:39:30,850 --> 00:39:33,970
in the workplace environment and the

1009
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,370
Commission has been tasked with drafting

1010
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:38,919
legislation and we expect something at

1011
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:41,529
the end of October in terms of that with

1012
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:42,970
that analysis and just finally in

1013
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:45,400
Queensland there's been the introduction

1014
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:46,689
of the Human Rights Act which applies to

1015
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:48,850
the government sector a bit it

1016
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:50,680
introduces a general right to privacy so

1017
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:52,450
now individuals will be able to make

1018
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:53,830
complaints to the Human Rights

1019
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:55,870
Commissioner for example if they're

1020
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:57,640
concerned about local councils setting

1021
00:39:55,870 --> 00:40:00,220
up cameras for example so I think that's

1022
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:01,910
all the time we have thanks very much

1023
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:04,560

1024
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:07,589
