1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:08,340
hi everyone my name is Jamila I work as

2
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:11,240
a security researcher at 11 pads 11 but

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:14,519
it's the telefónica cyber security unit

4
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:18,180
the idea of the stock came to us because

5
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:21,300
we usually think of Sims as defensive

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:24,180
tools or blue team tools and during this

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:30,269
talk we will see them from the point of

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:33,420
view of the attacker or the red team yes

9
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:38,129
I came from machine Tina very very long

10
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:41,040
it's 27 hours of a trip of 27 hours to

11
00:00:38,129 --> 00:00:44,670
get here so a very very very long trip I

12
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,160
think you might know my country for some

13
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:49,559
of the things messy who knows messy you

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:56,489
raise your hand may see all of you knows

15
00:00:49,559 --> 00:01:01,170
messy I know that dulce de leche anyone

16
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:03,899
oh just one three three people next time

17
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:08,750
I have to bring some dulce de leche for

18
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:11,909
you to try and asado

19
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:17,700
it's like Argentinean meat it's it's

20
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:24,630
delicious it's great well starting with

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:34,020
the talk seems a stand for security

22
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:36,899
information and event management sim

23
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:40,048
solutions combine security information

24
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:43,140
management management and security even

25
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:49,770
management security even management

26
00:01:43,140 --> 00:02:00,649
carries out low analysis of flawed data

27
00:01:49,770 --> 00:02:00,649
on on real-time to to detect straight ID

28
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:08,449
to provide even correlation thread

29
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:12,209
monitoring and incident response and

30
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:13,260
security information management is used

31
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:16,280
to analyze

32
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:21,019
the deadlock data in order to generate

33
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:21,019
reports of these microphones

34
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:37,980
well any of you knows plan okay

35
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:47,459
Splunk is a sim solution that use it has

36
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:49,670
a web interface it can search sorry

37
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,670
Esther

38
00:02:55,069 --> 00:03:00,290
okay Splunk is a commercial seem that

39
00:02:58,189 --> 00:03:04,608
that's important that allows you to

40
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:10,340
capture analyzed and and search for data

41
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:13,939
and within a web interface any of you

42
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:15,739
knows the other one drill of the open

43
00:03:13,939 --> 00:03:20,629
source one okay

44
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:24,019
Greg log is an open source seam the the

45
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:28,689
uses is like the this blank one used to

46
00:03:24,019 --> 00:03:33,290
search and monitor data with a

47
00:03:28,689 --> 00:03:36,798
centralized console and use MongoDB and

48
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:43,819
elastic search in order to store and

49
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:48,590
search for the data well who use this

50
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:52,599
this type of system these seems in

51
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:57,459
general sim solutions are mostly used by

52
00:03:52,599 --> 00:04:00,260
large organizations and public companies

53
00:03:57,459 --> 00:04:02,720
compliance with regulations remains a

54
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:07,220
very strong factor in the use of this

55
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:10,400
technology however from the point of

56
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:13,430
view of the attacker this is the

57
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:17,000
attacker hacker cut I allow it I love

58
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:21,620
hacker cut well the permission that

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,289
seems have on the server on which the

60
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:27,490
seam is installed the other components

61
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:32,360
on on the infrastructure are very broad

62
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:35,120
so you can use administrative access to

63
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,310
a seam it can be used to compromise the

64
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,389
server on which the seam is installed

65
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:45,970
and in some cases the declined equipment

66
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:45,970
from which the seams collect the event

67
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:53,930
well we are going to talk a bit about

68
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:59,870
blank versions and features I can see

69
00:04:53,930 --> 00:05:01,880
anything there so I just here the three

70
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:04,190
more important versions of explaining

71
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,430
the most use it's a light version but

72
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:08,879
but it's not it's not very used so we

73
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:11,069
are talking about it

74
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:15,439
free is blank enterprise and sprang

75
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:18,689
cloud the first one is plank free I

76
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:21,449
don't have any type of access control or

77
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:24,449
authentication any user who knows the

78
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:27,679
URL and it's not a very difficult URL

79
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:30,479
you can search in insulin for that and

80
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:35,219
you can access with administrative

81
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:37,979
privilege to the to the scene a Splunk

82
00:05:35,219 --> 00:05:42,360
enterprise can use several

83
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:48,769
authentication methods like LD IP proxy

84
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:51,899
SSO sam'l and scripting but in general

85
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:55,199
user name and password that's blank

86
00:05:51,899 --> 00:05:56,789
internal authentication method it's the

87
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:01,559
most use and is the default

88
00:05:56,789 --> 00:06:05,599
authentication metal M in a splendid

89
00:06:01,559 --> 00:06:10,889
enterprise you you could configure

90
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:13,378
password policies the the only one

91
00:06:10,889 --> 00:06:19,050
mandatory password policy for force

92
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:24,119
planning Enterprise is they ate they'll

93
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:27,599
launch the length of the password it's a

94
00:06:24,119 --> 00:06:35,069
it's mandatory to have a password from

95
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:37,649
eight or more characters length in new

96
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:41,369
versions you can configure another

97
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:45,929
things like password complexity I can

98
00:06:41,369 --> 00:06:52,969
look out after a serious or failed login

99
00:06:45,929 --> 00:06:56,849
attempts but this this password policies

100
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:59,279
are not applied in the same way in all

101
00:06:56,849 --> 00:07:06,899
cases so we are going to to see that

102
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:09,329
later in another slide well about the

103
00:07:06,899 --> 00:07:12,149
permissions explained free and sprang

104
00:07:09,329 --> 00:07:14,059
Enterprise are usually installed as as

105
00:07:12,149 --> 00:07:16,469
root or with administration

106
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:19,529
administration privilege you you can

107
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:20,969
stall it with an unprivileged user but

108
00:07:19,529 --> 00:07:24,600
it's not the

109
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:27,930
the common case in general and the the

110
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:29,160
important thing is in a Springfree and a

111
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:33,980
Splunk enterprise

112
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:38,520
you can upload custom applications or

113
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:42,690
that is to say you can brought your own

114
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:46,140
your own application and upload to just

115
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:50,190
blank application or script a Splunk

116
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:53,460
load is different because it's blank has

117
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:58,890
all the control on the environment so

118
00:07:53,460 --> 00:08:01,380
you can you can configure s plank by

119
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:04,530
changing configuration files by the

120
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:08,490
command line command line interface and

121
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:11,150
you can't upload a custom applications

122
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:15,120
and Ana script and the authentication

123
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:27,239
for Splunk load could be sam'l user

124
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:29,280
password or LD IP also okay it's blank

125
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,800
loud sorry

126
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,789
it's usually published on the internet

127
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:37,890
because of course is blank loud but why

128
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:40,468
would someone expose to the Internet is

129
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:44,550
plank free or Splunk enterprise I I

130
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:47,940
really I don't see any reason for for

131
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:52,229
that you can search children for forest

132
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:55,020
planks the first search is by a TTP

133
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:57,270
component and these are it returns all

134
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:00,090
these planks that have their web

135
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:03,510
interface published on the internet the

136
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:10,880
second one returns all these planks that

137
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:14,310
have the management port that is a 8089

138
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:19,700
with explained e you can search for all

139
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:19,699
all the these planks on the internet

140
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:27,050
well that is the s Planck law in page

141
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:34,620
analyzing the source code of the S plank

142
00:09:31,490 --> 00:09:39,750
login page we know this

143
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:41,730
that this is happening to access the

144
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:44,940
explained REST API endpoints is

145
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:48,480
necessary to be authenticated first but

146
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:52,470
in this case the spline login page the

147
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:55,050
API call is made directly from the from

148
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:57,960
the Splunk login page before the

149
00:09:55,050 --> 00:10:02,939
authentication process and the result is

150
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:06,990
loading in JSON as as you can see the

151
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:11,640
first endpoint service session indicates

152
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:14,210
with the property has logged in in in

153
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,800
the top of the of the screen and

154
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:24,900
indicates whether someone ever logged

155
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:28,979
into the sim if anyone ever has logged

156
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:32,130
to the sim it's very very likely that

157
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:34,770
the sims still still has the default

158
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:37,280
password that is changed me in in other

159
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:42,180
versions in new versions you can choose

160
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:46,020
your own from 7.1 you can choose another

161
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:50,040
password if at the installation time but

162
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:54,960
in Nollan versions the the default

163
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:57,170
password was changed me and in the other

164
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:05,610
[Music]

165
00:10:57,170 --> 00:11:10,500
in the other API call that is its

166
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:14,730
service server info this this has the

167
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:18,300
information of the of the blank license

168
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:20,970
and you can see there is if is blank

169
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:23,579
a free explain Enterprise or explain

170
00:11:20,970 --> 00:11:26,100
cloud and the version of s plank all

171
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:29,220
this before authentications just looking

172
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:35,190
at the source code of the blank login

173
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:37,320
page with this information and and the

174
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:39,390
shell and search for all these blanks

175
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,390
with the web interface exposed to the

176
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:46,199
internet I wrote two scripts to Python

177
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:47,750
script to detect a s planks at risk of

178
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,290
being compromised big

179
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:54,550
of default password or because they are

180
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:57,740
the free version with no authentication

181
00:11:54,550 --> 00:12:01,760
the first one that takes all the blank

182
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:04,520
free exposed to the Internet and the

183
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,130
second one that takes all the blanks

184
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:12,949
with default password previous version

185
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:26,150
to 77.1 that has no no more default

186
00:12:12,950 --> 00:12:29,990
password the result is this this country

187
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:32,120
an and 69s planks exposed to the

188
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:34,130
Internet at risk of being compromised of

189
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:37,340
being compromised for the full password

190
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:45,020
or because they are the free versions of

191
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:47,930
his blank who has no authentication well

192
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:49,640
but what's the case if s plank

193
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:53,750
displaying that we are going to attack

194
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:58,340
is not free and it has not the default

195
00:12:53,750 --> 00:13:01,940
password you can you can do a brute

196
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:05,450
force or a dictionary attack on the on

197
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:07,610
the password of the user admin in

198
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:10,370
previous version was admin now you can

199
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:14,410
choose another name for this user if you

200
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:23,300
want but in most most of the time the

201
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:27,310
user is still admin the DES plank a

202
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:30,020
brute force or or dictionary attack

203
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:34,130
could be performed on the web interface

204
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:43,699
or in the management part you could use

205
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:47,240
a very same Metasploit to to carry on

206
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:51,080
this attack and you can use other tools

207
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:56,630
such as Hydra on the web interface but

208
00:13:51,080 --> 00:14:00,170
the problem is in newest version you you

209
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:04,930
can configure a akan lookout but a

210
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:08,290
series of failed login attempts so our

211
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:13,310
approach is different

212
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:15,469
we made the the brute force or

213
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:17,630
dictionary attack on the management

214
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:23,320
interface not on the web interface

215
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:25,700
because they account lockout policy

216
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:29,480
doesn't apply to the management

217
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:31,760
interface you can try all the all the

218
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:41,480
password that you want and you won't be

219
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:45,260
looking the the admin account well I

220
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:47,630
will explain attack vectors 2 3 & 6

221
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:51,640
because you are going to see the others

222
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:58,030
in the demos that I brought today

223
00:14:51,640 --> 00:15:00,980
number 2 being a low analysis and

224
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:05,750
collection the first thing that we can

225
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:08,630
think of is use it as an intelligent

226
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:11,390
source to identify users in the

227
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:15,890
environment roles and usage patterns

228
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:18,470
that's attack vector 2 for attack vector

229
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:21,020
3 you can use the explained

230
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:24,440
functionality that uploads files -

231
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:27,140
indexes to read any file from the from

232
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:32,089
this from the server where Splunk is

233
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:36,910
installed for example the the shadow

234
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:39,920
file on on Linux or Linux systems and

235
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:43,990
attacked 6 is deploy malicious

236
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,990
applications Universal forwarders

237
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:55,040
well-explained has a functional itical

238
00:15:51,980 --> 00:16:01,580
deployment server this functionality is

239
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:03,709
used for deployment of applications our

240
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:06,199
configuration in distributed

241
00:16:03,709 --> 00:16:10,099
environments and also for configuration

242
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:10,870
of the M explained Universal forwarders

243
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:15,580
that

244
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:18,280
the Splunk collection agent the Asians

245
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:20,710
installed in the clients like in the

246
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:25,900
database server in the Active Directory

247
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:30,030
server for for collection of information

248
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:30,030
from Reuters or firewalls

249
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:41,839
about the applications it's very easy to

250
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:43,639
create this blank applications and s

251
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,310
Planck provides a template called

252
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:48,920
bare-bones that builds the entire

253
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:52,399
structure you only have to worry about

254
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:55,910
the directory being the directory bin

255
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:58,550
and this is the directory which contains

256
00:16:55,910 --> 00:17:01,850
the actual code of the of the

257
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:06,020
applications or script and this files

258
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:10,159
the file up comp this file contains all

259
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:20,119
the information of the of the

260
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:23,990
application configuration I forgot to

261
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:28,129
say this you come Splunk has native

262
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:32,409
Python support so you can build

263
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:36,200
applications in Python Perl a bash

264
00:17:32,409 --> 00:17:39,140
PowerShell and even an executable file

265
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:43,220
all all that could be could be

266
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:48,679
application or or scripts in use in a

267
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:54,200
spelunk with blank base ASP language is

268
00:17:48,679 --> 00:17:56,870
like the Play Store in Android is it

269
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:59,750
contains applications designed by Splunk

270
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:04,520
or by different providers to integrate

271
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:07,549
their products with with blank here the

272
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:12,350
list is ordered but the most downloaded

273
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:14,510
applications on the ones blank base you

274
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:22,490
can see the most use applications are

275
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:24,470
for Windows Linux Cisco database most of

276
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:26,600
these applications request credentials

277
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:30,530
to connect to the to the device they

278
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:34,610
monitor and these credentials are stolen

279
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:36,710
is plank and if we have admin access to

280
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:40,729
s plank we can access this credential

281
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:44,240
and an decrypted and unused in in our

282
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:45,950
attack to compromise other systems in

283
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,220
the first structure not just this blank

284
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,220
server

285
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:57,440
well now we are going to see the demo of

286
00:18:52,709 --> 00:18:57,440
the attack vectors 1 4 & 5

287
00:18:57,859 --> 00:19:06,779
first I I will perform a brute-force or

288
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:09,958
dictionary attack on the admin user of

289
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:14,509
Splunk and then obtain all the explained

290
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:14,509
stored password of of the applications

291
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:27,750
at first we are going to scan the

292
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:31,520
network in order to attack seems active

293
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:31,520
on on that network

294
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:50,200
that will detect it too - seems to us

295
00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:55,168
planks now we are going to choose the

296
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:55,169
the last one for in order to attack it

297
00:19:55,559 --> 00:20:04,539
and launch the attack model first we

298
00:20:01,389 --> 00:20:06,459
need to use the option one because we

299
00:20:04,539 --> 00:20:11,529
need the credentials that does the Bruce

300
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:14,350
for for dictionary attack now that we

301
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:17,649
have credentials we can use the other

302
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:21,490
attacks we are going with option I think

303
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:26,439
is for two to obtain all the blank

304
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:29,999
applications credentials we need to use

305
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,999
the credentials that we obtained before

306
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:39,730
okay and that's the credentials store on

307
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:44,019
on this blank it's the last version of

308
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:48,190
blank the first one is the are the

309
00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:50,200
credentials used by Palo Alto firewall

310
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,960
in order to administrate the fiber and

311
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:56,950
the second one is the account used for

312
00:20:52,960 --> 00:21:00,100
LD IP wines and this account generally

313
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:04,779
is a privileged account because it's

314
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:07,779
used for obtaining the logs of all the

315
00:21:04,779 --> 00:21:10,330
windows hosts on the infrastructure so

316
00:21:07,779 --> 00:21:14,700
generally it's it's a very privileged

317
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:17,619
account and for the attacker is it's a

318
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:27,480
very important that going to to have the

319
00:21:17,619 --> 00:21:31,330
credentials for well now we are going to

320
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:34,119
install a malicious application to

321
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:40,600
obtain a reverse shell from the blank

322
00:21:34,119 --> 00:21:43,769
server we are going to attack the same

323
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,769
seam as before

324
00:21:52,299 --> 00:22:00,940
lunch they attack model and in this case

325
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:02,830
we are going with option seven upload

326
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:05,709
malicious up to a spline server or

327
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:10,619
Universal forwarder it could be used on

328
00:22:05,709 --> 00:22:13,659
both the server or the universal forward

329
00:22:10,619 --> 00:22:23,978
it's a Linux esplen server in this case

330
00:22:13,659 --> 00:22:26,320
so we are going with option one we need

331
00:22:23,979 --> 00:22:28,359
to enter the credentials and our local

332
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:32,769
IP address for the reverse for receiving

333
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:36,009
the reverse connection the application

334
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:40,509
is so ready install our shell and we are

335
00:22:36,009 --> 00:22:44,289
going to start listener on port 1 2 3 4

336
00:22:40,509 --> 00:22:46,739
5 in order to receive the the reverse

337
00:22:44,289 --> 00:22:46,739
connection

338
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:03,789
now we have to wait a few seconds and

339
00:22:59,899 --> 00:23:09,820
Splunk will connect to us that's it

340
00:23:03,789 --> 00:23:09,820
Splunk connect to us with root privilege

341
00:23:11,049 --> 00:23:18,440
the application that we install in this

342
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:23,178
case is a python reversion because it's

343
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:28,070
a lino server and on windows M Universal

344
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:31,610
forwarders you you can't use Python and

345
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:37,970
you you need to use PowerShell or or

346
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:44,508
another a a bi T file or another another

347
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:50,080
payload this this tool is developed by

348
00:23:44,509 --> 00:23:54,580
us in in 11 pads ok

349
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,580
recommendations for hardening Splunk

350
00:23:54,669 --> 00:24:01,279
first we need to start

351
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:05,409
Splunk the server and the universal

352
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:07,820
forwarders with and privileged users

353
00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:10,940
change all the default password of

354
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:14,689
course use another authentication method

355
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:18,830
not Splunk internal and if it's possible

356
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:22,879
a second authentication factor you still

357
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:25,428
yes TLS please don't use this blank free

358
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:27,678
in production environment I I see so

359
00:24:25,429 --> 00:24:29,240
many flanks free in production

360
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,879
environment I think it's because the

361
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:34,460
cost of blank and and all that but

362
00:24:31,879 --> 00:24:39,320
please it has no authentication it's

363
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:41,389
it's the worst don't expose the explain

364
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:44,509
server on the internet of course except

365
00:24:41,389 --> 00:24:46,729
cloud that do you need to to put it on

366
00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:50,720
the Internet and the same day web server

367
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:53,149
if there is no need most of the attacks

368
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:56,919
choose planks are based on the web

369
00:24:53,149 --> 00:25:00,379
server so it's an attack surface

370
00:24:56,919 --> 00:25:04,100
reduction disable the web server when

371
00:25:00,379 --> 00:25:07,699
when you don't use it update and purge

372
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:09,810
Splunk in a regular basis and enable a

373
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:17,130
Splunk outlet it's the in

374
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:20,129
X underscore audit now we are going to

375
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:23,100
talk about grello same case as before

376
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:26,850
who published the grello web interface

377
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:29,310
on the Internet I don't see any reason

378
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:32,250
there is no great load cloud or

379
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:37,169
something like this so it's I I don't

380
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:41,510
understand this the most important

381
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:45,120
Trello components are MongoDB

382
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:50,940
elasticsearch the web interface and the

383
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:53,070
rest api the attack vectors you will

384
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:55,710
notice that the attack vectors are all

385
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:59,340
different this is because Greylock does

386
00:25:55,710 --> 00:26:05,760
not allow us to upload code through the

387
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:08,820
web interface so you just can customize

388
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:11,610
inputs/outputs another so we need to use

389
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:16,470
other attack vectors different than the

390
00:26:11,610 --> 00:26:20,840
than the splines ones the first one is

391
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:23,610
the the brute force or dictionary attack

392
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:28,070
in order to perform this attack we need

393
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:31,469
to do a post request to this URL API

394
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:35,370
system sessions and the username is

395
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:38,940
admin you can change it and icons are

396
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:42,750
not lookout for fail access attempt

397
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:49,350
that's attack vector number one you can

398
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:51,480
configure it it it has the policy for

399
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:54,709
for configuring the logout it is not

400
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,710
there in in gorilla

401
00:26:56,060 --> 00:27:03,000
well great log virtual machines

402
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:05,100
appliances relevant on machines

403
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:11,690
appliances OVA

404
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:14,730
or am i m has those password by default

405
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:16,830
the first one for the web interface is

406
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:20,610
admin I mean a very difficult

407
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:21,679
combination of username and password to

408
00:27:20,610 --> 00:27:24,320
guess

409
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:31,580
and I want to won't do for the for the

410
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:34,840
console and additionally in grade level

411
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:38,510
tone machine appliances elasticsearch

412
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:41,959
MongoDB and the web interface are

413
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:46,310
listening on all the interface I think

414
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:48,350
that's the reason by that we're why

415
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:50,090
there are so many great looks exposed on

416
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:52,879
the internet I thinks it's not

417
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:59,000
intentional it's people that just

418
00:27:52,880 --> 00:28:02,930
install the built well machine appliance

419
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:06,740
and didn't notice that that it's going

420
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:12,020
to publish these ports on on all the

421
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:14,720
interfaces as attackers we could chase

422
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:16,670
those default credentials to see if they

423
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:26,000
are valid that's attack vector number

424
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:30,140
two same same cases as Splunk

425
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:33,350
and greg log store credentials but in

426
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:36,020
the database in MongoDB in MongoDB you

427
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:39,199
can find some store passwords not like

428
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:44,830
not like this blank ones but but some

429
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:47,630
password for example they LD IP one this

430
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:49,760
this password these credentials can be

431
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:52,820
decrypted using the sick the secret a

432
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:56,170
store in the gray log server and that's

433
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:56,169
attack vector number three

434
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:07,580
recommendations for Greylock hardening

435
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:09,590
please please please don't use a virtual

436
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:12,169
machines grail of virtual machines in

437
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:14,510
production environment I seen it so many

438
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:17,870
times a lot like is plank free provide

439
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:20,060
please don't do that limit the interface

440
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:22,909
on which MongoDB and elasticsearch

441
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:24,860
listen for incoming data a set up

442
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:27,560
authentication for MongoDB this is

443
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:29,010
important because in the installation of

444
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:32,520
grail of

445
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:34,740
by default the MongoDB is installed

446
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:39,210
without any type of authentication so

447
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:41,420
you need to configure it later enable

448
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:44,550
the access log and use another

449
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:47,520
authentication for the web interface not

450
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:51,810
user name and password and any field if

451
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:57,990
you could please use another a second

452
00:29:51,810 --> 00:30:00,480
factor authentication method well here

453
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:07,710
you have some resources and downloads

454
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:10,200
and for more information based on the

455
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:13,770
results of this research we developed

456
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,320
these tools that we show us before the

457
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:19,170
name of the tool is Simms framework

458
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:21,240
allows to automate all these dimension

459
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:24,450
attack in commercial and open source

460
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:27,750
seems and the tool is open-source and

461
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:30,390
will be released on August blackhat

462
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:34,020
Arsenal and it will be include Splunk

463
00:30:30,390 --> 00:30:36,920
Trello for sim and other seems that that

464
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:41,940
we are trying to incorporate to

465
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:48,090
incorporate sorry incorporate to the to

466
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:50,400
the tool and thank you very much for

467
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:53,610
your attention and special things to

468
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:56,500
assert for inviting me to this really

469
00:30:53,610 --> 00:31:01,879
really great David thank you

470
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:03,900
[Applause]

471
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,190
thank you very much for that it's

472
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,330
fantastic

473
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:09,570
do we have any questions from the

474
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:17,490
audience oh one off the back ah great

475
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:18,780
get my steps up so just a quick one it

476
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:21,000
run his long into this is an imperfectly

477
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:22,500
privileged position did you think about

478
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,640
actually deploying something so that

479
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:27,960
when they log in you harvest their

480
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:30,870
credentials or you something sorry I

481
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:33,630
didn't understand the question so Iran

482
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:35,760
whose logins and admin uh-huh

483
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:38,550
could you exploit that could you have

484
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:40,379
that as a module so it drops a shell or

485
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:42,780
drops a bit of malware so that then when

486
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:45,810
they log in your RSA attack they log in

487
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:49,470
and get popped it's it's very

488
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:50,790
interesting at that vector I didn't I

489
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:55,020
didn't think of that

490
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:59,129
but but it's it's really it's a well we

491
00:31:55,020 --> 00:32:01,820
don't do illegal things do we are there

492
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:04,560
any other questions

493
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:08,439
nope well in that case thank you very

494
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:11,019
much' Miller round of applause guys

495
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,019
[Applause]
