1
00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:08,580
here we have Scot helm giving his

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,019
presentation called crash burn report if

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,660
you could give him a warm welcome

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:16,710
applause thank you

5
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:19,590
hopefully that won't be my feedback in

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,119
the app after this talk so thank you

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,250
very much for coming my name is Scott

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,539
you may have seen me I'm on the

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,939
Twitter's a lot I talk a lot about

10
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:29,189
information security and various bits of

11
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:31,619
research that I do there I also blog I

12
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:34,260
run security headers you made to me from

13
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:36,660
there and I also have my own little

14
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,739
startup called report your I now I just

15
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:41,790
wanted to start with a little bit of

16
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:43,019
kind of a bit of an outline of what

17
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,239
we're going to talk about today because

18
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:48,090
when I start to talk about new browser

19
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,559
features many people kind of have that

20
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:50,820
little internal sigh where they're like

21
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:52,559
oh great you know there's gonna be like

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,660
bad support or it's gonna be you know

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,430
difficult or not backward-compatible

24
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:59,699
or this is like all of these really

25
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,750
genuine and valid concerns and the good

26
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,649
news is today that what I'm going to

27
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:04,619
talk about something called the

28
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:07,439
reporting API is actually really widely

29
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:09,119
supported some of the features are only

30
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,259
supported kind of you know towards the

31
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,790
left of this diagram

32
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:13,380
some of the features aren't quite

33
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,390
supported to the right side of this

34
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,490
diagram yeah that was perfectly just you

35
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:18,930
know coincidental ordering it was not

36
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,080
like you know good too bad left to righy

37
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:23,159
I'm not saying that but the really good

38
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,360
thing is as we go through what you'll

39
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,220
see is that it doesn't actually matter

40
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,240
if there is no support or poor support

41
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,720
for some of these things it's not

42
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:33,179
actually a problem now I'm sure like me

43
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,750
many of you have some kind of website

44
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:38,640
online could be personal blog could be

45
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:39,570
corporate website may be you know it's

46
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,560
just a little bit of brochure where

47
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,298
maybe you're actually an e-commerce

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,250
platform on your website is like really

49
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,829
really important because that's like

50
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,149
your actual sales platform but it

51
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:50,070
doesn't really matter like I'm pretty

52
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,170
you know pretty confident to say that

53
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:54,419
all of us have something online and like

54
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,860
me I do my blog I have a couple of other

55
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,899
services which are a bit more important

56
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,119
but to me this is really important and I

57
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:02,640
want people to be able to go online and

58
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,290
access it for this to be a good

59
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,390
experience for there to be no errors for

60
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,569
there to be no problems be they

61
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:12,030
performance security availability or

62
00:02:09,568 --> 00:02:12,829
otherwise and this is why I put my site

63
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,840
there because I want

64
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:17,390
you to visit it now in order to help me

65
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,160
do that I have lots of different tools

66
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:21,200
that I use because along comes the

67
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,210
visitor and you know they like hey I

68
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,369
when I go to Scott's website read his

69
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:27,200
latest articles so off goes their

70
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:30,500
request when they type in my domain and

71
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,070
it ones on the server running my

72
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:36,800
blogging application and then hopefully

73
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:39,410
some kind of response will be generated

74
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,820
now there's lots of different things

75
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:42,950
that can go wrong at this first step

76
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,420
already my application could be having a

77
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:47,060
really bad day the server could be

78
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:49,190
overloaded all kinds of different things

79
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:50,630
can go wrong and to help me detect that

80
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:52,760
in - money - that there are lots of

81
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,799
different tools and utilities at my

82
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,500
disposal raising raise your hand does

83
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,720
anyone either use or use something

84
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,370
similar to one of these services who has

85
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,660
something so there's loads like this is

86
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,240
basically everyone in the room right

87
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,250
because we want to be able to see these

88
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,480
errors we want to have visibility we

89
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:10,310
probably centralize them I mean I'm

90
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,410
actually using paper trail I've used New

91
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,390
Relic quite extensively in the past so

92
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:15,920
we want to know when things go wrong at

93
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,420
these platforms these tools these

94
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,399
services will help us do that that's

95
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,950
fantastic hopefully nothing goes wrong

96
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,480
we generate the response we send the

97
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:25,540
response back over to the browser and

98
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,590
you get to read my article read my blog

99
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:29,840
purchase your thing on Amazon whatever

100
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:30,890
it was that you came here to do but

101
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,930
again there are things that can go wrong

102
00:03:30,890 --> 00:03:34,339
on the client-side and fall out there's

103
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,720
lots of monitoring solutions that we can

104
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:37,519
use on the client side

105
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,470
now again like quick show of hands

106
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,390
either one of these awesome equivalent

107
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,940
service who uses something like this on

108
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:46,369
the client-side okay so that's a lot

109
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:48,320
what small percentage that's very very

110
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:50,750
usual trend but the point here is that

111
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:53,540
there are lots of things to help us make

112
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:53,959
sure that things are going according to

113
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:56,030
plan

114
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:57,590
I want users to come to my site read my

115
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:00,080
blog you want users to go to your site

116
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:02,200
and to buy things or to to read your

117
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,250
blog's but that doesn't always happen

118
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,540
there are lots of things that can go

119
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,900
wrong and that's why we have so many

120
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:11,260
tools and utilities to help us but what

121
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,260
about this one

122
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:17,060
this browser has tried to go to my

123
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:18,829
website now this is an intentional area

124
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,420
that I've made it make okay I've gone to

125
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:22,340
a subdomain on my website that doesn't

126
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:25,330
exist so if you try to go to this

127
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,950
subdomain there is no DNS entry for it

128
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:29,390
so it will not resolve there for a page

129
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:31,070
will not load and the browser will throw

130
00:04:29,390 --> 00:04:34,640
kind of one of these full-page warning

131
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:35,930
messages that we see here now the really

132
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,289
interesting thing goes let's just say

133
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:40,160
this was my actual site this was my www

134
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:41,930
brain

135
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,060
there is something that has gone quite

136
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,190
wrong and the user has not been able to

137
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:49,310
come to my website as they intended as

138
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,870
they wanted to but if we think about all

139
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:52,940
of the the monitoring that we just

140
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:57,350
talked about which one of these things

141
00:04:52,940 --> 00:05:00,230
is going to help me here right and we

142
00:04:57,350 --> 00:05:01,670
kind of have this gap where if something

143
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,840
happens that actually prevents that

144
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:03,860
initial connection we're going to talk

145
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,260
about all the different things that can

146
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:07,790
go wrong but there was no DNS lookup or

147
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:09,230
they did the DNS lookup in the domain

148
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:10,970
didn't resolve ok great there was no

149
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,230
request but there's no request then

150
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:13,280
nothing on the service I can help us

151
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:15,290
because what's it going to look at

152
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,299
nothing arrived if there's no request

153
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:20,030
there's no response and nothing on the

154
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,830
client side can help us so now we have

155
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:23,719
like this invisible arrow from our

156
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,280
perspective as as the people running the

157
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,770
website where someone's trying to come

158
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:33,440
and visit us and they've not been able

159
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:35,599
to do that but we don't know that this

160
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,370
is what the reporting API will help us

161
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,950
solve it will help us see these

162
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:42,350
invisible people these invisible errors

163
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:44,060
these invisible failures in our

164
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:46,490
infrastructure our applications whatever

165
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:49,130
it may be because the reporting API

166
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:51,830
allows you to introduce an out-of-band

167
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:53,300
reporting mechanism so when the

168
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:54,830
communications breakdown between the

169
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,229
browser and our infrastructure our

170
00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:00,020
servers wherever that might be and these

171
00:05:57,229 --> 00:06:01,640
two things cease to exist the browser

172
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,919
can now send that telemetry that

173
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:06,380
reporting information out-of-band and

174
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,030
incidentally full transparency one of

175
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:10,040
the services that I run is designed to

176
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:11,809
ingest this data because if you think

177
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,640
about this if you can't make a

178
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:15,470
connection to the host we can't send the

179
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,630
telemetry to the same location it has to

180
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,950
go external because I can't connect to

181
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:20,659
there the host that I was trying to

182
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,940
connect to so we have to have some kind

183
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:24,590
of third party and that can be a third

184
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,240
party infrastructure that you also own

185
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,119
but it

186
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,160
has to be third party has to be

187
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,650
out-of-band to the failed connection on

188
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,940
the way in now this sounds really good

189
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:36,159
it's like okay great I can learn about

190
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,270
all of these invisible errors that I

191
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,120
couldn't see previously all these

192
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:42,190
failure cases now to turn on the

193
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,530
reporting API this is pretty simple

194
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:47,020
first of all the first step of the

195
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:49,448
configuration is to add the report to

196
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:51,008
header here now these are HTTP response

197
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:52,900
headers you're probably familiar with

198
00:06:51,009 --> 00:06:54,550
most of the ones up there if you want to

199
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:57,068
indicate to the browser that I would

200
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,830
like you to send me this telemetry this

201
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:01,930
is how you configure it there is no code

202
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:04,090
to deploy there's no agent there's

203
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:07,389
nothing like that that you have to do

204
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:09,068
this is built in native functionality in

205
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:10,780
the browser and you're essentially just

206
00:07:09,069 --> 00:07:12,789
kind of hooking that so that this is a

207
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,138
really simple deployment and all you

208
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:15,880
have to do is put the configuration you

209
00:07:14,139 --> 00:07:17,380
can see the report two headers JSON so

210
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,650
we'll just open that out and you can see

211
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:22,810
what you would put inside this header so

212
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:23,979
you have to create a reporting group so

213
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:26,110
you can see here on the first line my

214
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:27,639
group I've just called it default you

215
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:29,860
can call it whatever you wish so I have

216
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:31,630
a group called default the next one the

217
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,889
max age this is the number of seconds

218
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,840
that the browser should cache and

219
00:07:32,889 --> 00:07:36,550
remember this setting for and this is

220
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,229
kind of where a little bit of the magic

221
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:40,539
happens because you know you connect to

222
00:07:38,229 --> 00:07:43,060
my website now everything's working but

223
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:44,409
you connect tomorrow and it fails the

224
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:46,599
browser obviously has to remember what

225
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:48,699
to do when it fails so this is kind of

226
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:50,949
the the key part here max age the number

227
00:07:48,699 --> 00:07:53,909
of seconds the browser should enable and

228
00:07:50,949 --> 00:07:56,229
cache this policy for an applying

229
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:58,870
endpoints we then pass in an array of

230
00:07:56,229 --> 00:08:00,758
locations where you can send reports to

231
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,169
so again as I just mentioned I have a

232
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:04,060
little demo account and report your eye

233
00:08:02,169 --> 00:08:06,280
and I'm just saying when something goes

234
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:09,069
wrong this is why you should send the

235
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,900
telemetry you can again put any URL that

236
00:08:09,069 --> 00:08:11,949
you would like in here and inside this

237
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,750
array you can actually have multiple

238
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:15,400
when the browser will even do fallback

239
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,440
so if we try to dispatch it to the first

240
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,969
endpoint and it fails we'll fall back to

241
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,099
the second to make sure that you

242
00:08:18,969 --> 00:08:22,659
definitely get this piece of telemetry

243
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:25,090
and then the last one includes

244
00:08:22,659 --> 00:08:27,159
subdomains this is hopefully fairly

245
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:30,068
self-explanatory if you turn this on

246
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:31,569
then I want you to send me the following

247
00:08:30,069 --> 00:08:32,950
information about not just the domain

248
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:34,900
that you're on but all subdomains

249
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,969
underneath it as well

250
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:38,659
so you got like test subdomains def

251
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:40,430
subdomains this would incorporate all

252
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:44,329
those and you would receive the

253
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:46,160
telemetry for them now enabling the

254
00:08:44,329 --> 00:08:48,500
reporting API this is just to tell the

255
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,509
browser where to sent the information

256
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,339
when something goes wrong the the

257
00:08:50,509 --> 00:08:54,139
something that goes wrong is is what you

258
00:08:52,339 --> 00:08:56,360
then need to subscribe to so what things

259
00:08:54,139 --> 00:08:57,980
do you want to know about when they go

260
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:00,649
wrong so this is how and where to send

261
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,480
stuff next we need to think what stuff

262
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:04,189
do we want the browser to send so the

263
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,839
first one we're going to look at is

264
00:09:04,189 --> 00:09:08,240
something called Network error logging

265
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,819
now now as we kind of like casually

266
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,529
refer to it this is one of my favorite

267
00:09:10,819 --> 00:09:13,969
features that uses the reporting API

268
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:16,370
because the information that you can get

269
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:21,110
back from now is something that I just

270
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:22,850
can't see how we would get otherwise so

271
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:26,029
to fix the error that I showed you on my

272
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:29,300
blog just a moment ago now will send you

273
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:30,620
all kinds of reports about various DNS

274
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,508
failures these are just some of the

275
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:35,329
error codes that we're going to look at

276
00:09:32,509 --> 00:09:37,579
what if the client can't reach your DNS

277
00:09:35,329 --> 00:09:39,620
resolver what if the name isn't resolved

278
00:09:37,579 --> 00:09:41,899
the lookup failed or some other thing

279
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,009
went wrong a DNS because if all of your

280
00:09:41,899 --> 00:09:45,230
visitors are trying to get to your

281
00:09:43,009 --> 00:09:47,990
website and your DNS isn't resolving

282
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:49,189
then unless you notice that you know for

283
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:50,329
some reason you have slightly lower

284
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:52,399
traffic you're not going to really

285
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:54,709
receive any information about that now

286
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,930
we'll tell you about various DNS

287
00:09:54,709 --> 00:09:58,758
failures days ok the DNS lookup works

288
00:09:56,930 --> 00:10:00,829
clients got to go to the next step of

289
00:09:58,759 --> 00:10:03,110
the connection then we're talking about

290
00:10:00,829 --> 00:10:04,849
TCP well it turns out there's a whole

291
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,639
lot of things that can go wrong at TCP

292
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:10,759
as well the connection failed it was

293
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:13,550
reset the server refused it the client

294
00:10:10,759 --> 00:10:16,100
can fail again at the point of TCP and

295
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:19,279
then still send you a report about one

296
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:22,189
of these specific incidents if you will

297
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:26,329
ok TCP connection works what comes after

298
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:28,430
TCP for most websites nowadays TLS we've

299
00:10:26,329 --> 00:10:29,989
got to establish the HTTPS connection

300
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,309
the secure connection and there's a

301
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,110
whole heap of stuff that can go wrong

302
00:10:31,309 --> 00:10:36,050
here and this is one of the most common

303
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:37,550
things that we see more specifically was

304
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:40,579
the fact that the certificate is invalid

305
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:42,500
because it's expired so again the the

306
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:44,269
browser comes along you're serving the

307
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,279
wrong certificate it's expired you've

308
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:48,500
somehow misconfigured it but there are

309
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:51,439
lots of different things that can go

310
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,520
wrong at TLS because it's a complicated

311
00:10:51,439 --> 00:10:54,560
thing to deploy and to keep

312
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:56,090
right on an ongoing basis but again if

313
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,589
the browser fails to connect at this

314
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,960
point you still wouldn't get telemetry

315
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:01,940
from any of those other systems but now

316
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:04,130
the browser will dispatch it straight to

317
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:06,440
you and of course in all circumstances

318
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:07,910
if the connection goes well and does

319
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,860
then we can get up to the application

320
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:13,010
layer but there are still things that

321
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:14,420
can go wrong there as well so with

322
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:15,410
Network error logging and this is just

323
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:17,540
one of the things that we're going to

324
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:19,939
look at there's a whole heap of

325
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,680
information that the browser will send

326
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:23,750
to you and if you want any of this

327
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,339
information then all you need to do is

328
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:27,110
indicate to the browser that yes I would

329
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:31,100
like this information and I would like

330
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:34,100
you to send it to me now again super

331
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:37,280
super simple to do this because if you

332
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:39,470
get one of these on your site and we've

333
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,910
got here like a fairly kind of typical

334
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,590
certificate in one of these by the way

335
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,300
everyone has seen one of these usually

336
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,560
usually it's because you're in like an

337
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,849
airport a train station and they're

338
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:49,430
trying to force you to log into the

339
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:52,070
Wi-Fi most often it's because the site

340
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:53,839
has forgot to renew their sir and you

341
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:56,090
know some bad things have happened if

342
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:58,220
the browser sees one of these you want

343
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:00,200
to know about it tell the browser that

344
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,930
you want the information and all you

345
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,700
have to do is issue another header so we

346
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:07,069
had the reporting API header earlier

347
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,930
report too that says where to send the

348
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:11,270
information the network error logging

349
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:13,130
header says okay I want you to send it

350
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:15,079
to the report to endpoint called default

351
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:16,910
remember earlier the group had the name

352
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,230
default so you're basically saying if

353
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:20,240
anything goes wrong with you know this

354
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:21,830
particular set of errors I'd like you to

355
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,260
send it to that group and I'd like you

356
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:26,810
to remember my preference for us

357
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,550
approximately a year in a second so

358
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:31,430
again if the browser comes to my website

359
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:33,020
today it will cache this policy and next

360
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:35,060
Tuesday you come to my website my

361
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:37,130
certificates expired and the browser

362
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:39,229
will say I remember Scott wants me to

363
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:41,090
send this error report over there and

364
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:44,060
I'll get these errors and I want these

365
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:46,430
areas because they're really they're

366
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,890
really useful so to take a look at kind

367
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:51,349
of a common example this is the JSON

368
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:52,340
payload that will be sent so for every

369
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:53,660
single one of these areas that we're

370
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:56,540
going to talk about you go really nicely

371
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:58,969
formatted JSON payload sent as a HTTP

372
00:12:56,540 --> 00:13:00,770
POST request to the specified endpoint

373
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:03,710
so this isn't you know particularly

374
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:05,850
difficult stuff the age if the browser

375
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:07,319
can't connect to the endpoint it

376
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:09,750
cash the report and try and send it

377
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:11,370
later so age will tell you how long ago

378
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:13,079
this problem happened so if you know

379
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,850
this is one hour you know this problem

380
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:17,790
happened one hour ago it's just taking a

381
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:19,440
while to dispatch the report type this

382
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:21,540
was a network error where was the user

383
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:25,170
trying to go here's the URL then the

384
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,219
actual body itself so you can see here

385
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:27,300
these are all you know kind of the

386
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,610
fairly simple things that you would

387
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,019
expect to see sampling fraction if you

388
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:34,170
want to slow down the volume of reports

389
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:36,420
this is really handy for that the values

390
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:38,250
they refer server IP are blank because

391
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:40,319
the connection failed it was a get

392
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:42,060
request elapse time it took the client

393
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:44,430
92 milliseconds to arrive at this

394
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,979
failure this is all the information that

395
00:13:44,430 --> 00:13:48,689
you need to act on the problem because

396
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,490
the type down here is kind of the

397
00:13:48,690 --> 00:13:52,259
ultimate woman

398
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:53,850
TLS error because of the certificate

399
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:55,410
because the date was invalid you're

400
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:57,449
using an expired certificate in

401
00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:00,839
production and this happens a lot

402
00:13:57,449 --> 00:14:02,758
this happens an awful lot so when do you

403
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,230
normally find out about this if you have

404
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:06,569
an expired certificate in production

405
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:08,310
what's your usual channel for finding

406
00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:10,620
out because it happens and it happens to

407
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:12,349
a lot of organizations not just small

408
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:15,480
organizations either it can happen to

409
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:17,850
quite big organizations certificates

410
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,949
expiring in production is not you know

411
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:22,410
some edge case scenario it turns out

412
00:14:19,949 --> 00:14:24,180
that it happens quite a lot and the

413
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:27,630
usual reporting mechanism for this is

414
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:29,609
Twitter it's like hey we've got loads of

415
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:31,170
tweets and you know this was actually a

416
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:34,350
LinkedIn certificate it was all of their

417
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:36,630
country domains so for my particular one

418
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,250
here is like the UK dot subdomain and

419
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:41,069
all of their country level certificates

420
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:42,449
had expired and you usually find you do

421
00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:44,719
usually find out about this on Twitter

422
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:47,849
and it's a very fast alerting mechanism

423
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,410
now interestingly sometimes you know it

424
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:51,480
happens to financial institutions as

425
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:53,250
well this is a large bank in the UK

426
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,259
called Barclays it was for their home

427
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:57,360
insurance Department and I love their

428
00:14:55,259 --> 00:14:58,439
incidentally I love the help down at the

429
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,750
bottom here it's like could you please

430
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:02,490
try using a different browser like

431
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,990
that's gonna fix the problems like are

432
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:06,480
the certs expired use Firefox and you

433
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:08,459
can go back to yesterday I don't know

434
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,449
what they were hoping for there but you

435
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:10,859
know I'm not just saying that this is a

436
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:12,120
big problem because it seems to be I'm

437
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:14,220
saying this is a big problem because I

438
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,779
have the data to back this up one of the

439
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,880
other projects that I run is a crawler

440
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:19,560
and I have this crawler flee I crawl

441
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,630
atop a million websites in the world

442
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:24,300
every day and analyze like whole bunches

443
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:26,460
of stuff about their security it punches

444
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,930
out these raw data files every single

445
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:30,390
day that you can go look at and it

446
00:15:27,930 --> 00:15:32,160
produces lists of the first one here is

447
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:33,720
a list of sites whose certificates are

448
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,250
currently expired in production so you

449
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,260
can grab one of those websites go to it

450
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:39,150
and it will have an expired sir the next

451
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:42,060
one is sites through certificate expires

452
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:43,740
one day or less from when the crawler

453
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,390
looked at it so if you're viewing this

454
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:47,339
like 12 hours after the crawler produced

455
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:49,080
it chances are like half of them have

456
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:50,790
already gone down and I actually did

457
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,470
this tour not so long ago in Norway and

458
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,029
someone has to look at one of the files

459
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:55,950
and I found like oh hey there's an ad I

460
00:15:54,029 --> 00:15:57,270
know a norwegian domain on the one day

461
00:15:55,950 --> 00:16:00,060
list and it's like wow they've got like

462
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:01,589
38 minutes to go and i open the web site

463
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:05,550
at the end of my talk and they were down

464
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:06,930
so it happens a lot the the three and

465
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:11,189
seven day ones there are as you would

466
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:12,540
expect so don't you know Nellie's not

467
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:15,000
going to catch this before that error

468
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:16,680
happens now a carry logging basically

469
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,779
tells you when all else has failed this

470
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,569
is your last line of defense this is not

471
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:23,250
preventative but this is the worst has

472
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:25,770
happened and we need to know about it as

473
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:28,890
soon as that first user hits that first

474
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:31,290
error you'll get the report so you can

475
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:34,589
know about it earlier sooner and respond

476
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:36,540
better but it's not just Network era log

477
00:16:34,589 --> 00:16:39,810
in either there's a whole bunch of stuff

478
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:41,040
that the browser can tell you about so

479
00:16:39,810 --> 00:16:43,140
we've covered network era logging

480
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,640
let's take a look at the next option

481
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:47,339
over which is something called

482
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:50,100
deprecation reports now deprecation

483
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:51,330
reports are really handy and I have an

484
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:54,300
example of where they would have saved

485
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:55,950
an awful lot of organizations now this

486
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:57,630
is a supermarket in the UK they're a

487
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:59,370
fairly big one I think like birth second

488
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,320
third biggest in the country

489
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:03,600
this is Sainsbury's and like many

490
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,760
different websites they have a store

491
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:07,530
locator you go to the store locator you

492
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,819
hit the little GPS button up here it

493
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:11,040
will geo locate your phone on your

494
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,959
device and then it will give you route

495
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:15,420
guidance to the nearest store this is a

496
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,410
useful feature I've used this once or

497
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:19,800
twice especially and I've been

498
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:21,839
travelling in different cities all of

499
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:24,359
these stopped working one day a few

500
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,730
years ago they all just cease to

501
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:30,389
function you would go here you would

502
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:31,380
press the little GPS button and nothing

503
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:35,130
happened

504
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:37,110
can anyone tell me why this would not

505
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:39,799
work why this no longer works why it

506
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:39,799
stopped working

507
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:49,049
louder sorry mm it's more it's more

508
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,179
related to something that you can see on

509
00:17:49,049 --> 00:17:54,090
this screen more specifically we're

510
00:17:51,179 --> 00:18:00,770
using the geolocation API look at the

511
00:17:54,090 --> 00:18:04,678
address bar the geolocation API requires

512
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:07,470
HTTPS correct the geolocation does now

513
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:08,549
require HTTPS because the browser

514
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:10,620
vendors looked at this and they were

515
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:12,360
like well we're sending these as GPS

516
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:15,629
coordinates down to like six decimal

517
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,129
places which is like this fairly

518
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,030
personal information right like who

519
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:20,190
stood in this square

520
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:22,168
well that's Scott because like he's the

521
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:23,789
only person that's where so it's fairly

522
00:18:22,169 --> 00:18:25,500
sensitive data and quite rightly they

523
00:18:23,789 --> 00:18:27,750
said look we're going to disable the

524
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,280
geolocation API and HTTP because we

525
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:32,820
don't want users sending sensitive data

526
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:36,059
in clear now google wrote this on their

527
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:37,379
blog and firefox wrote on their blog put

528
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:43,080
your hands up if you read the Google or

529
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:44,400
Firefox developer blogs to people so how

530
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,870
are you supposed to know that they were

531
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,570
going to turn off this thing that your

532
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,709
production website depends on because

533
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:50,789
apparently the answer is like you're

534
00:18:49,710 --> 00:18:52,530
supposed to read the blog through all

535
00:18:50,789 --> 00:18:53,879
the browser's and know the things that

536
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,918
they're going to do but this is super

537
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,230
difficult and this is why in the UK and

538
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:00,030
it was probably the same here loads of

539
00:18:58,230 --> 00:19:01,260
these websites with the functions like

540
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:02,299
this you'd like to sit there and press

541
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,650
the button and nothing would happen

542
00:19:02,299 --> 00:19:06,450
because they deprecated something that

543
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:07,890
you depend on if the browser vendors

544
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:10,020
going to deprecated something that you

545
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:12,179
do depend on would you like to know

546
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:15,090
about it and with deprecation reports

547
00:19:12,179 --> 00:19:19,440
the answer is yes you can if you wish

548
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:21,629
because had we had deprecation reporting

549
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,990
back then this is the JSON payload that

550
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:26,880
those web sites would have received you

551
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:29,159
get the same JSON payload format we saw

552
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,260
before the type is now deprecation what

553
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:34,679
URL did you go to the body of the report

554
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:36,510
ID okay we're failing on geolocation the

555
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:39,090
anticipated removal day of the feature

556
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:41,429
within the browser basic low message

557
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:44,418
geolocation is deprecated over HTTP and

558
00:19:41,429 --> 00:19:47,220
will be removed in chrome 50

559
00:19:44,419 --> 00:19:49,140
the great thing about this is that as

560
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,320
soon as the browser vendor has decided

561
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:54,210
they're going to deprecated something

562
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:55,439
you will start getting the reports so

563
00:19:54,210 --> 00:19:57,390
they could have potentially had these

564
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,630
reports months before this features

565
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:02,549
stopped working on their side now

566
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:03,870
hopefully like day to day generally

567
00:20:02,549 --> 00:20:06,000
speaking you should get none of these

568
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:07,379
hopefully like the goal is that we're

569
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,850
not using anything that's currently

570
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,440
deprecated or soon to be deprecated

571
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:13,500
however if you do start receiving

572
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,000
reports like for deprecations that's

573
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:16,980
something that you literally need to go

574
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,750
look at because you're using something

575
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,029
that will stop working soon that there's

576
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,649
no scenario in which I can't see how

577
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:25,740
this information would not be directly

578
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:28,049
and immediately useful but it's not just

579
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:30,059
deprecation either we have something

580
00:20:28,049 --> 00:20:32,100
called intervention reports does anyone

581
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:34,049
know what a browser intervention is this

582
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,580
right it's such the wrong term they're

583
00:20:34,049 --> 00:20:36,299
gonna come in and like you know does

584
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:41,789
anyone know what our browser

585
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:43,918
intervention is the browser can choose

586
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:47,010
not to do things that you've asked it to

587
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:49,200
do if it feels that that action is bad

588
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:51,240
for user experience but for user

589
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,760
performance or bad for users of

590
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,929
curiosity so you may ask the browser to

591
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,240
do something and the browser will look

592
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:58,710
at it and say on balance we're not gonna

593
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:02,039
do that for one of those three reasons

594
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:03,779
that's what we call an intervention now

595
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:06,960
like I said reasons can vary user

596
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:08,029
experience performance security let's

597
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,289
take a look at an intervention report

598
00:21:08,029 --> 00:21:11,820
and get a picture of what one of those

599
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:14,250
things might be so here's an

600
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:16,590
intervention report similar JSON form

601
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:19,830
again type intervention you went to my

602
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:22,350
website the ID audio no gesture and the

603
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:24,389
message is a request to play audio was

604
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:26,730
blocked because it was not triggered by

605
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:29,039
user activation who has been to a

606
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:30,870
website that does this and is this not

607
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,190
super or not like I have I don't know

608
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:34,080
time out to my browser in a minute and

609
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:35,970
I've got like 68 tabs open and one of

610
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,860
them starts playing music and have like

611
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:39,029
tap tap tap tap tap where's the audio

612
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,678
icon because they're all so small I

613
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:42,450
can't see them that's super annoying

614
00:21:40,679 --> 00:21:43,950
from a user experience perspective and

615
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,460
browsers are starting to pick up on

616
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:46,830
things like that

617
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:48,419
Auto playing video is another one of

618
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:51,330
them so this is purely for the user

619
00:21:48,419 --> 00:21:53,039
experience side performance what if the

620
00:21:51,330 --> 00:21:55,049
users on a limited connection low

621
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,309
throughput has then ever gone to a

622
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:57,110
website I thought like why did the fonts

623
00:21:56,309 --> 00:21:58,850
look funny today

624
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:00,409
go into the console and there will be a

625
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,480
message saying we're using the fallback

626
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:04,520
font because bandwidth is restricted so

627
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:08,299
the page will load faster if we don't

628
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,830
pull in all 87 font files because again

629
00:22:08,299 --> 00:22:10,700
the browser is trying to protect the

630
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:13,639
user experience

631
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:15,679
it won't do certain things so these are

632
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:17,750
what we call interventions where you're

633
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,940
expecting something to have happened in

634
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:22,309
your browsing experience but the browser

635
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:24,650
has decided no this is not going to

636
00:22:22,309 --> 00:22:26,090
happen so again generally speaking you

637
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:28,730
will hope to not get any of these

638
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:30,918
reports but if you are receiving these

639
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:32,330
reports then it means that your users

640
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:34,610
are not having the experience that you

641
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:35,899
think that you intend now if that's for

642
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:37,459
security or performance reasons you

643
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:39,169
probably really want to look at it user

644
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,070
and is depends on your view and you know

645
00:22:39,169 --> 00:22:42,770
whether you want to keep trying to

646
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:45,139
autoplay video and make people watch or

647
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:48,160
listen to them but again you can ask the

648
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:48,160
browser to tell you

649
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:53,449
intervention reports covered one of the

650
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:55,400
last main ones that we're going to look

651
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:57,679
up is then something called crash

652
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,600
reports so again all goes through the

653
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:02,240
same reporting API however there's only

654
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,520
one particular type of crash report that

655
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,720
you can get right now and this is only

656
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,280
ever going to be triggered by one

657
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,540
browser so let's take a look at a JSON

658
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,000
payload and see if you can tell me which

659
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:13,730
browser is going to send these type

660
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,380
crash report went to my website you get

661
00:23:13,730 --> 00:23:17,540
a unique crash ID from the client which

662
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:21,860
you can go correlate with logs later and

663
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:25,370
the reason is oom out of memory which

664
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:28,699
browser might send lots of these so

665
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:30,199
every was like growling so again the

666
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,250
crash reporting is still quite young

667
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,820
still in its infancy

668
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:36,049
oom out of memory is that only supported

669
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:37,730
the reason that you're going to get for

670
00:23:36,049 --> 00:23:39,950
these at the minute but again maybe you

671
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:41,179
have particularly underpowered clients

672
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:43,460
maybe your application is doing

673
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:44,960
something crazy stupid that you you know

674
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:47,210
you've missed and it's just consuming

675
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,799
all the RAM you know probably cuz users

676
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,360
using Chrome but like that reason aside

677
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:53,418
you know there's something that you can

678
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:56,360
go do about that if you know about it so

679
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:59,419
all of these reports all of this

680
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,918
information is available to you all of

681
00:23:59,419 --> 00:24:03,440
the functionality that I've just talked

682
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:05,300
about is natively built into the browser

683
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,800
you don't have to deploy some code or an

684
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,629
agent or have the user install some

685
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:10,480
extension or thing on their machine it's

686
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:11,799
built into the browser

687
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,540
those two response headers that we

688
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:15,700
looked at earlier they're the only two

689
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:17,110
things that you need to change because

690
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:18,790
basically all you're doing is saying

691
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:20,469
like hey send me this information and

692
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,700
this is where you should send it and

693
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:23,380
that's all that you have to do to get

694
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,330
this working now those are the major

695
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:27,490
kind of things that I'm super interested

696
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:29,559
in right now but there's actually more

697
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:31,150
than this the browser can send you a lot

698
00:24:29,559 --> 00:24:33,340
more information than the ones that

699
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:35,309
we've just looked at and this is still

700
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:39,309
by the way not an exhaustive list

701
00:24:35,309 --> 00:24:41,530
content security policy is an amazingly

702
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:44,080
powerful feature that allows you to

703
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:46,720
essentially whitelist the sources of

704
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,040
content in your application so you can

705
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,750
say to the browser like hey look when

706
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:52,270
you come to my website we only load

707
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:53,620
JavaScript from code jQuery com

708
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:55,360
we don't know JavaScript from anywhere

709
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:57,580
else we just load JavaScript from here

710
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,799
and the browser will say okay great like

711
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:01,360
I know that later on the browser's

712
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:03,580
rendering a page and I'm like hey look

713
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,500
at this there's a there's a JavaScript

714
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:08,530
file here from evil calm funny it's like

715
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:10,179
forward slash keylogger is now the

716
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:11,500
browser with the prime information that

717
00:25:10,179 --> 00:25:13,570
you gave it in content security policy

718
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,340
would be like well Scott told me that

719
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:16,780
he's only gonna load a javascript firm

720
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:19,000
the jQuery CDN so I'm not gonna load

721
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:20,770
this javascript file number one that

722
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,660
uses now protected because the evil

723
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:25,090
kamma keylogger file is not in my page

724
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:27,190
at number two the browser will send me a

725
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:28,990
report and say hey Scott like I came to

726
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:31,179
your website and you told me all of your

727
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:33,130
JavaScript would come from here but I've

728
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:34,870
just found this piece of JavaScript from

729
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:36,940
somewhere else and it will send that to

730
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:38,709
me so if I receive that report I'm gonna

731
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,630
be like oh my god like evil calm slash

732
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:42,280
keylogger Jes like I should probably go

733
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:45,580
check this out and see why I have that

734
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:47,710
on my page it's a hugely powerful

735
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:50,889
mechanism not just a script you can do

736
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:52,660
styles images fonts form actions x-h

737
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:54,370
ours where should we send stuff not just

738
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:56,440
where should we fetch stuff you can

739
00:25:54,370 --> 00:26:00,629
control every aspect of your application

740
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:04,120
that you want to next one over HP KP

741
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:05,590
this mechanisms actually currently going

742
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:07,510
through deprecation in chrome because it

743
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:09,639
was too powerful it's not often that we

744
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:10,900
say that about a security feature it was

745
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,200
too powerful and it was too difficult

746
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:15,250
for people to deploy so Chrome and

747
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,809
Firefox are the only browsers that

748
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:19,090
support it chrome is currently pulling

749
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:22,299
it which will leave just Firefox behind

750
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:24,350
but this is a an ultra strong protection

751
00:26:22,299 --> 00:26:26,570
if you deploy HTTPS on your website

752
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:28,639
- essentially bind your website to the

753
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:31,850
encryption keys on your servers such

754
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:34,039
that no one else can ever have a viable

755
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:37,100
option for impersonating your website

756
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:38,570
online but lots of people configure this

757
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,250
wrong because it's very technical very

758
00:26:38,570 --> 00:26:42,470
difficult and we actually have this

759
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:43,640
thing called HP KP suicide which is when

760
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:45,919
you deploy this and you deploy it wrong

761
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,720
and then you just break your website so

762
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,070
this is very controversial if you're

763
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:51,440
interested you should read this off just

764
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:55,490
for the controversy certificate

765
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:56,690
transparency is an unheard of CT okay

766
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:59,870
everyone I was in my course two days ago

767
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:01,190
put your hands down so I did a two day

768
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:02,689
course just before the conference it's

769
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:04,490
like an advanced 2-day course on

770
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:06,320
encryption stuff certificate

771
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:08,090
transparency is the ability for you to

772
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,158
know about every certificate existence

773
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:12,139
issued to your website with the idea

774
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,159
being but if you look at the list of all

775
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,169
the certificates you should recognize

776
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:16,190
them all and I saw one over here is

777
00:27:15,169 --> 00:27:18,580
gonna go to a certificate for your

778
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:21,200
website that shouldn't have one now

779
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:23,449
whether or not you know about CT all of

780
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:25,700
your websites right now must be what we

781
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:28,309
call CT qualified they must meet the

782
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,630
certificate transparency criteria now

783
00:27:28,309 --> 00:27:30,860
the vast majority of people in this room

784
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:32,450
didn't raise their hands and they don't

785
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:34,760
know about it but your websites will be

786
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:36,289
compliant because your certificate

787
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:39,200
authority and the browser's can take

788
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:39,890
care of this however that doesn't always

789
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,659
go right

790
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:43,250
browsers are made by people who aren't

791
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:46,429
perfect see aids are made by people who

792
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:48,200
aren't perfect if your website is not CT

793
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:50,120
qualified the browser will not load it

794
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,549
and they'll get a big red error message

795
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:54,110
in the browser you can have a report

796
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:55,730
about that hey I'm trying to go to your

797
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:58,010
website and I refuse to load it because

798
00:27:55,730 --> 00:28:00,049
you've not met these criteria great I

799
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:02,990
would love to know about that because I

800
00:28:00,049 --> 00:28:05,570
need to go fix that problem button left

801
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:07,309
here feature policy feature policy is a

802
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:08,870
much more recent introduction but it's

803
00:28:07,309 --> 00:28:11,389
one that I'm particularly fond of again

804
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:13,158
because you can control a lot more

805
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,960
powerful API including things like

806
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:17,570
geolocation the camera API the

807
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,770
microphone API let's say you have an

808
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,210
advert on your website

809
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:21,830
you got your page you got like a fairly

810
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:24,620
basic google ID or whatever it might be

811
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:26,178
down at the bottom that advert requests

812
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:27,590
microphone permission the user will get

813
00:28:26,179 --> 00:28:28,610
a pop up in the top life saying this

814
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:31,158
website would like to use your

815
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:33,350
microphone that doesn't look

816
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:34,940
particularly good because it's not you

817
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:36,678
requesting it perhaps it's just the

818
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:38,529
advert but there are a series of

819
00:28:36,679 --> 00:28:40,820
powerful api's like this in the

820
00:28:38,529 --> 00:28:43,759
that script on the page can request

821
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:45,769
access to with feature policy you can

822
00:28:43,759 --> 00:28:47,690
declare which api's are allowed to be

823
00:28:45,769 --> 00:28:49,849
used on your website so if you go to my

824
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:51,799
website in my blog you will see that

825
00:28:49,849 --> 00:28:54,109
things like the geolocation API aband on

826
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:55,668
my website i say to the browser look if

827
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:57,859
you come to my website I don't need

828
00:28:55,669 --> 00:28:59,749
geolocation so let's turn that feature

829
00:28:57,859 --> 00:29:02,029
off because then it can't be abused

830
00:28:59,749 --> 00:29:04,279
let's turn off the microphone permission

831
00:29:02,029 --> 00:29:05,509
the camera permission localstorage all

832
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:07,669
of these things that we don't need let's

833
00:29:05,509 --> 00:29:10,339
just turn them off because we don't need

834
00:29:07,669 --> 00:29:12,379
them then if something comes along and

835
00:29:10,339 --> 00:29:14,119
tries to request that let's say I have

836
00:29:12,379 --> 00:29:16,158
that advert and it tries to request the

837
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:18,289
microphone the browser will send me a

838
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,519
report and say Scott you told me that

839
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:20,899
you weren't going to use the microphone

840
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:23,450
on your website so I've blocked to this

841
00:29:20,899 --> 00:29:25,008
attempt and I'm also going to tell you

842
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:26,719
and let you know so I can know that

843
00:29:25,009 --> 00:29:29,149
there is something on my website trying

844
00:29:26,719 --> 00:29:31,339
to access powerful features like the

845
00:29:29,149 --> 00:29:34,789
microphone for users to visit in my site

846
00:29:31,339 --> 00:29:37,668
so this is a fantastic kind of attack

847
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:39,139
reduction mechanism you can reduce the

848
00:29:37,669 --> 00:29:41,179
attack surface by taking those powerful

849
00:29:39,139 --> 00:29:42,708
features away and maybe it's one of your

850
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:43,789
developers maybe it's like hey you know

851
00:29:42,709 --> 00:29:46,099
we've deployed this new thing into

852
00:29:43,789 --> 00:29:47,719
production and you know we don't want

853
00:29:46,099 --> 00:29:49,549
some developer to start like sucking

854
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:51,499
down geolocation data from the browser

855
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:53,899
from our clients because in the UK like

856
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:55,549
we have this gdpr thing so like we have

857
00:29:53,899 --> 00:29:57,320
to be super stringent especially with

858
00:29:55,549 --> 00:30:00,859
potentially personal data like

859
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:03,408
geolocation next one over cross-site

860
00:30:00,859 --> 00:30:04,908
scripting auditor who knows what the XSS

861
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:06,889
auditor is I know I'm familiar with the

862
00:30:04,909 --> 00:30:08,839
auditor I can like two or three people

863
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:10,339
this is a fascinating thing because this

864
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:12,168
is built into chromium so things like

865
00:30:10,339 --> 00:30:14,418
chrome and and all other browsers like

866
00:30:12,169 --> 00:30:16,369
that cross-site scripting attack would

867
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:19,070
be the keylogger example that I gave

868
00:30:16,369 --> 00:30:20,658
just a few minutes ago someone gets a

869
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:22,158
script tag in your page and loads in

870
00:30:20,659 --> 00:30:23,989
that key logger maybe it's an advert

871
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:26,359
maybe you know someone's like to come in

872
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:28,219
a review section on your website best

873
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:30,529
site ever and we pasted a script tag

874
00:30:28,219 --> 00:30:32,019
goes onto the page loads the script that

875
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:35,389
would be a cross-site scripting attack

876
00:30:32,019 --> 00:30:39,079
now the auditor in chrome and like soon

877
00:30:35,389 --> 00:30:41,269
edge as well will try and detect attacks

878
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:43,969
similar to that if the browser can look

879
00:30:41,269 --> 00:30:45,469
at the page and say we think there's a

880
00:30:43,969 --> 00:30:48,079
reasonable chance that this user is

881
00:30:45,469 --> 00:30:49,969
currently under attack the browser will

882
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:51,408
take steps to mitigate that it may

883
00:30:49,969 --> 00:30:51,830
remove the script from the page it may

884
00:30:51,409 --> 00:30:53,360
even

885
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:54,918
refused to load the page and say look

886
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,019
there's something on this page that we

887
00:30:54,919 --> 00:31:01,640
really don't think that you should go

888
00:30:57,019 --> 00:31:03,440
see this is on by default in Chrome if

889
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:05,390
this is happening on your site your user

890
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,519
is already seeing those big warning

891
00:31:05,390 --> 00:31:09,500
messages if you enable the reporting

892
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,149
mechanism you can have the browser send

893
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,679
you that and it will actually send you

894
00:31:11,149 --> 00:31:14,600
the attack payload that's really cool

895
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:16,760
because you actually get the hostile

896
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:19,279
JavaScript that chrome thinks is trying

897
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:21,110
to attack your user as well now whether

898
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,460
or not you you want that it doesn't

899
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:24,019
matter this is there and it's turned on

900
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:25,490
by default all you're doing here is

901
00:31:24,019 --> 00:31:28,070
subscribing to receive the information

902
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:29,690
back now for me that that's kind of like

903
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:32,000
a no-brainer because this thing may

904
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:34,279
already be happening and you don't know

905
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,659
about it so all we're changing here is

906
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:38,600
the fact that you will you will know

907
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:41,480
about it and then the last one down on

908
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:43,908
the bottom right here OCSP expects they

909
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,620
pull OCSP stapling is a really great

910
00:31:43,909 --> 00:31:47,720
performance feature that every website

911
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:50,268
should turned on that you have turned on

912
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,220
because if you're using HTTP this can

913
00:31:50,269 --> 00:31:53,840
help you make things go faster the

914
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:56,059
online certificate status protocol if

915
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:58,309
you'd like to do some further reading on

916
00:31:56,059 --> 00:32:00,049
that but again you may turn on this

917
00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:00,500
performance and privacy protecting

918
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:01,850
feature

919
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,559
I don't think great you know like we

920
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:06,500
should have this on for these two

921
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:08,000
particularly great reasons what if you

922
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,220
have it misconfigured what if you have

923
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,769
it broken what if you have it not

924
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:14,690
switched on one day the browser will

925
00:32:12,769 --> 00:32:16,279
tell you if you and this is the thing

926
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:19,039
with the browser nowadays it's not just

927
00:32:16,279 --> 00:32:20,269
a portal to which we send HTML and the

928
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,460
user looks of it that's kind of the old

929
00:32:20,269 --> 00:32:25,070
view of a browser it's like yep there's

930
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:26,240
some HTML let the user show it and like

931
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:27,620
you know come back later and do

932
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,320
something the browser is now a very

933
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:32,928
active participant in the delivery of a

934
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,120
secure browsing experience if you ask it

935
00:32:32,929 --> 00:32:38,480
to help you and ask it to give you this

936
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,549
information it will do every single

937
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,350
thing on here and on the previous slide

938
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:44,360
and all of the ones that I've not had

939
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:45,949
time to talk about they're all native

940
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:49,490
browser functionality they're all built

941
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:52,970
in and all you have to do is ask for

942
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:55,450
this information from the browser thank

943
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,450
you very much

944
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:02,860
so I left just a couple of minutes

945
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:05,050
before lunch for questions first of all

946
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:06,850
are there any before I start on my spiel

947
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:08,440
if you do wish to leave please do I

948
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:11,399
won't be offended I will take some

949
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,400
questions now though yes

950
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:18,669
just wondering how old that what was the

951
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:20,380
header called the reporting one their

952
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:22,660
reporting API one reporter so the

953
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:24,040
reporting API it was sometime in

954
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:25,750
September last year when the first

955
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:28,780
version of Chrome with support came out

956
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:31,120
so like seven months ish eight months

957
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:32,649
now okay that's cool so that kinda led

958
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,290
on to my second question which was gonna

959
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:37,120
be tracking their old clients that are

960
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:38,260
incapable of doing your version to tell

961
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,889
this but they're not gonna have that

962
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:43,510
header anyway yeah so we kind of coming

963
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:45,130
back to the old client thing there and

964
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:46,390
this is this kind of ties into another

965
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:47,980
points that I made about not worrying

966
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:50,620
about support too much for pretty much

967
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:52,390
most of the errors there we actually

968
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:54,850
don't need all of our clients to tell us

969
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:56,470
we have a problem if like if only one

970
00:33:54,850 --> 00:33:58,419
percent of our clients tell us we have a

971
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:00,940
problem we know we have the problem so

972
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:02,890
in in most scenarios it's actually like

973
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:04,390
well if everyone here can see my website

974
00:34:02,890 --> 00:34:06,070
is broken and just you three people tell

975
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:07,720
me I've still kind of learned the thing

976
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:09,670
that I need so for the vast majority of

977
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,350
these we don't need a hundred percent

978
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:13,060
support we don't need a slight edge in

979
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:14,319
Safari don't support this yet well

980
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,330
that's great but as long as Chrome users

981
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:18,600
tell us our website is screwed then like

982
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:21,929
I'm okay with that

983
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:24,100
any more questions right at the back

984
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:26,469
Josh do you feel brave to shout or do

985
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:27,429
you on a wing for the mic they're gonna

986
00:34:26,469 --> 00:34:31,409
wait for the mic cool

987
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:31,409
that's alright I'll put you on the spot

988
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:39,670
how do you go with false positives and

989
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:43,239
do you get a lot like if I do you handle

990
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:45,070
false positives Dome coat UK and refresh

991
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:48,429
a bunch of times do you get spammed a

992
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:50,530
lot so I'll try not so the question that

993
00:34:48,429 --> 00:34:51,730
I think you're asking and and just to

994
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:53,890
talk about report your eye a little bit

995
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:55,750
so as a service provider like as a

996
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:57,310
website operator I don't really try and

997
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:59,020
deal with the false positives but that's

998
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:01,180
kind of one of the purposes that I built

999
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:03,400
report your eye for in that we will

1000
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:05,710
handle false positives for our clients

1001
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:07,360
so you know this is just JSON ingestion

1002
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,840
and everyone is welcome to light you

1003
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,880
know ghost

1004
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,890
an Alex that can AWS and and just like

1005
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,510
suck all this data in but there is

1006
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:14,799
always like little quirky things

1007
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:16,270
happening on the internet and you and

1008
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,150
you do get like this baseline level of

1009
00:35:16,270 --> 00:35:20,680
noise and false positives so you do kind

1010
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,670
of have to refine that data a little bit

1011
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,069
but that's one of the things that we

1012
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:26,170
were really trying to focus on was you

1013
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:29,200
know how to just end up with the truly

1014
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:30,310
essential reports but we're just to put

1015
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,319
that in context we're doing about

1016
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:33,820
eighteen point six billion reports a

1017
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,590
month for our customers of the minute so

1018
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:37,870
we're basing our false positive

1019
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:43,050
detection on like a fairly big pool of

1020
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:45,790
data every month any more questions

1021
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:46,960
now if there are come find me now come

1022
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:50,640
find me at lunch I'm here for the rest

1023
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,640
of the event and thank you very much
