1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:06,569
I'm going to jump straight into it we

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:09,480
have Steve Clement and Christian Student

3
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:12,300
amiss threat sharing platform a platform

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,759
for sharing storing and correlating

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,609
indicators of compromises of targeted

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:26,689
attacks if you give him a warm welcome

7
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:30,570
applause guys thank you very much the

8
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:32,399
overarching title is rather generic so

9
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,579
we might be a little bit flexible in the

10
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,870
in the beginning basically my name is

11
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,140
steve clemons I'm an information

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,390
security engineer for team circle I have

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,370
been working for circle for over 10

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:46,980
years I've been in InfoSec for more than

15
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:50,879
20 years and currently I am working out

16
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:54,510
of out of Tokyo and mainly I do miss

17
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:59,430
related stuff from orchestration of the

18
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:03,180
thing to documentation translations a

19
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:06,570
lot of testing so that's my my core task

20
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:09,810
at this moment it would be two-parter so

21
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:12,059
we will have a tag-team relationship

22
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:14,580
during the next few minutes with you

23
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,740
we're Christian we'll go through the

24
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,600
basics and what is missed why is missed

25
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,908
and then I will take it further with a

26
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,229
couple of example weather examples what

27
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:24,960
it actually looks like and then

28
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:26,100
depending on what you what you're

29
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,470
interested in

30
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:31,740
we might either go into a more

31
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:35,420
philosophical discussion about how do we

32
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:40,320
actually decay data when is data dead

33
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:42,659
including how can I put a data into a

34
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,689
value system how valuable is data and

35
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,759
perhaps people who participate in

36
00:01:44,689 --> 00:01:51,449
sharing that data so first up is

37
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,909
Christian good afternoon my name is

38
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:58,170
Christian I'm working for a circle

39
00:01:53,909 --> 00:02:00,479
mostly as software developer I am the

40
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:04,020
one behind the all the interactions

41
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:07,049
between mists and the Stix format today

42
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,840
we are going to speak about information

43
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:13,379
sharing and more specifically about the

44
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:20,079
malware information sharing platform

45
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:23,290
so circle circle is Monday to Monday at

46
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:27,900
8:00 Monday did sorry but the ministry

47
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:32,230
of economy and acting as the national

48
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:37,689
cert in Luxembourg for private sector we

49
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:42,060
are also developing miss p-- and many

50
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:47,019
different open source software's for

51
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:50,370
miss we run multiple instances multiple

52
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:54,879
communities performing active

53
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:57,670
information sharing every day I want to

54
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,670
mention that for miss wheels who are

55
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:06,010
co-financed by the ministry sorry by the

56
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:10,720
European Union speaking about the

57
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:12,970
communities so circle operates many

58
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,250
different large communities one of the

59
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:19,109
biggest one is the one for the private

60
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:22,569
sector hosting more than a thousand

61
00:03:19,109 --> 00:03:26,049
organization this one is actually open

62
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:29,048
every organization who wants to join us

63
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:33,930
can just send us a request there are

64
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:39,069
also many other communities hosted by

65
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:43,359
Caesars NATO some security vendors or

66
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:47,018
researchers for the most active ones we

67
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:52,569
have usually an average of 4,000

68
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:55,919
indicators shared every week so let's

69
00:03:52,569 --> 00:04:01,328
speak a bit about history of MIS p--

70
00:03:55,919 --> 00:04:03,940
everything started around 2012 one of

71
00:04:01,329 --> 00:04:07,319
our colleague attended a malware

72
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:11,650
analysis workshop and actually all the

73
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:14,918
different attendees realized they were

74
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:20,380
all working kind of all working on the

75
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:24,310
same malware analyzes so they wanted to

76
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,820
figure out a way of duplicating of avoid

77
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:29,510
duplicating

78
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:33,670
word and find an automated way of

79
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:36,590
sharing the information they gathered

80
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:39,860
Christophe on the bluff working at that

81
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:43,849
moment for the Belgian cert and working

82
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:47,360
of our NATO then worked on platform

83
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:52,220
which was some of the first versions

84
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:55,240
that would became later become later

85
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:58,450
missed know as you know MASP is a

86
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:04,580
community driven platform led by

87
00:04:58,450 --> 00:05:07,610
underdevelopment is led by circle so you

88
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:12,080
could basically find many different

89
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:15,080
usage for a mass as an analyst you would

90
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:19,820
be interested in sharing information

91
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:25,250
with your colleagues sharing indicators

92
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:27,640
in operational security also gathering

93
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:31,070
information about specific address

94
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:33,830
adversary groups or if you're more in

95
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:39,830
the financial sector share financial

96
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:45,370
indicators here is a standard overview

97
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:48,530
of our governance model we as the main

98
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:54,880
developers of mist we are also some of

99
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:59,059
the main users we have so the MIS

100
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:02,510
features we want to present we want our

101
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:06,140
users to feel comfortable about so we

102
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:09,590
give many trainings during the year all

103
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:13,310
around the world we also have yearly

104
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:15,859
summit during our conference in

105
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:22,070
Luxembourg called hat dot Lu in October

106
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:26,390
and you can also use gator github to

107
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:29,210
raise any issue you have we use a gator

108
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:33,740
which is a chat application to keep

109
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:36,560
contact with our users and also to and

110
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,800
also for users who want support about

111
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,800
miss

112
00:06:38,809 --> 00:06:47,030
so Miss B is a modular piece of

113
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:48,499
open-source software we have everything

114
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:54,558
[Music]

115
00:06:48,499 --> 00:06:58,439
related to the software so the Miss core

116
00:06:54,559 --> 00:07:02,339
would basically yeah the code related to

117
00:06:58,439 --> 00:07:06,839
the platform itself the Miss modules for

118
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:13,020
people who want to enrich data shared

119
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:15,629
and MASP we also have a powerful API in

120
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:21,240
Python called pi miss if you want to

121
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:25,110
automate some request recipes also miss

122
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:28,770
paths also some templates that can be

123
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:31,589
used to give more context to your data

124
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:34,159
so the taxonomies and the galaxies I

125
00:07:31,589 --> 00:07:36,930
will present it later

126
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:41,248
also the notice lists and a warning

127
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:43,949
lists to avoid false positive Steve will

128
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:47,479
speak about it what is important is we

129
00:07:43,949 --> 00:07:51,770
want to provide an open source standard

130
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:58,699
we do think that sharing information

131
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:58,698
should use open yeah open standard so

132
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:12,439
what could you miss used for basically

133
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:16,919
you would use it as a detection matter

134
00:08:12,439 --> 00:08:21,749
perhaps you see some IP addresses you

135
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:28,919
want to feed your detection systems with

136
00:08:21,749 --> 00:08:32,449
or you see some malicious I IPS you want

137
00:08:28,919 --> 00:08:32,448
to feed your

138
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:46,330
firewalls with to block them but also

139
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:49,330
you may want to know who is Tariq

140
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:54,070
targeting you who are your adversaries

141
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:59,080
and you can also use Mizpah to perform

142
00:08:54,070 --> 00:09:02,110
intelligence in that sense what is quite

143
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:05,050
beautiful by design is that all all

144
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:08,770
these data flows can be exported and

145
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:12,959
ingested into third-party applications

146
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:16,480
for example for the entire intelligence

147
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:19,120
analyzes if you have a multi go license

148
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,800
you could just install a small plug-in

149
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,800
and it will actually just enrich now

150
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:27,069
multi go with all the data that might be

151
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:29,109
in your in your threat sharing platform

152
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:31,540
the other thing I wanted to mention

153
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:35,260
earlier is for the use case of law

154
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:37,390
enforcement or other more legally strict

155
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:40,030
entities where the data actually might

156
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:44,110
need to be notarized or might need to go

157
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:45,670
in front of a judge we are living in a

158
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:48,340
world where this becomes more and more

159
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:51,160
important that things are legally safe

160
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:53,200
and sounds judges have understood that

161
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,079
cryptography actually might even give

162
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,570
you a good legal basis on on the

163
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:02,020
authenticity of certain pieces of data

164
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:05,080
and as it stands now the data points

165
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:07,270
that might be in our platform they are

166
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:09,570
not notarized so if someone goes into

167
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:13,060
the database and kind of tweak something

168
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:15,640
that is a problem and this is one of the

169
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:17,199
challenges we also face for the future

170
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,030
what what are we going to do how can we

171
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,540
make sure that this is actually legal

172
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:25,510
data and there

173
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:27,490
dare I to say technology like blockchain

174
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:29,380
might be very interest a very

175
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,910
interesting use case where you would put

176
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:34,210
all that stuff into the blockchain and

177
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:35,410
well now it's in theory cannot be

178
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:39,930
changed or at least it gives you a

179
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:39,930
certain amount of insurance

180
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:48,849
so one of the features about miss p-- is

181
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:54,089
you can totally have your own miss

182
00:10:48,850 --> 00:11:01,330
instance totally offline where you share

183
00:10:54,090 --> 00:11:07,270
data with USB sticks whatever or you can

184
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:09,580
have it online synchronizing data from

185
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:12,490
the other instances and so on

186
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:16,290
another feature very important is the

187
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:21,460
ability of is the ability to share data

188
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:26,040
through different formats sticks for

189
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:28,570
example you also may want to figure and

190
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:35,620
antivirus systems with some error rules

191
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:40,780
and so on important characteristic here

192
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:45,220
is we want it to be modular we want it

193
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:48,760
to be customizable so it fits your

194
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:51,580
workflows yeah and just to reiterate the

195
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:54,160
the island mode or rather an air-gapped

196
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:56,380
use case by now you might have seen that

197
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,420
this is really flexible and maybe

198
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:59,980
overwhelming but I'm fairly sure that

199
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:02,310
depending on which sector you actually

200
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:04,870
work in you might already now have

201
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:06,130
identified a certain use case how you

202
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:09,270
could use it

203
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:12,910
the air-gapped one might be I have to

204
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:15,730
make a digital forensics acquisition of

205
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:18,550
a very high-profile case and this is

206
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:21,970
classified data this can only be done on

207
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:24,280
a system that is not connected to any

208
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,260
external networks and because again of

209
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:29,939
the modularity if you only have a Mis

210
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:32,920
Pro installation it does not rely on any

211
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:36,570
up links to to the Internet but you can

212
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:39,969
just quite easily in offline mode just

213
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:42,490
populate your your instance and then be

214
00:12:39,970 --> 00:12:44,980
more or less sure that the data just

215
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:48,090
really stays where you think it

216
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,090
physically is

217
00:12:50,810 --> 00:13:01,699
so we have a pretty basic way of sharing

218
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:07,060
information it's a data structure called

219
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:11,570
an event an event is events are

220
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:17,660
basically the data that are shared among

221
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:23,120
the among the different instances here

222
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:26,959
is a more here is the what an event

223
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:30,320
looks like so basically it's some meta

224
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:35,300
data that can be understandable by a

225
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:38,270
human so with a name describing what

226
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:41,329
we're dealing with you can also add some

227
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:45,050
context to it with some tags it has a

228
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:48,260
certain distribution because you you

229
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:52,040
want to distribute it to your community

230
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:53,050
to all the communities wherever we still

231
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,839
will speak about it

232
00:13:53,050 --> 00:14:01,010
we got regular questions about the best

233
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:03,440
practices when it comes to to threat

234
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:05,300
intelligence and the only thing we

235
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,340
really can say it it highly depends on

236
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,349
your use case if you have humans in

237
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:11,420
front of a computer that need to make

238
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:14,150
sense out of a couple of hundred events

239
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:16,040
then for example if they are the

240
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:18,560
operators who input the data the

241
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:21,520
information what the event is about

242
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:24,500
needs to be human readable and your

243
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:27,770
community needs to understand what you

244
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:29,600
mean if it is a computer to a machine to

245
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:31,160
machine laying obviously then that field

246
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,250
doesn't really become that important

247
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:36,250
anymore but I would actually argue for

248
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:39,350
always having a human readable

249
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:41,810
information field that that you can

250
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:44,600
analyze afterwards because it's I think

251
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:46,520
it's a fallacy to think that the theory

252
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,800
the machines will eventually take over

253
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:50,780
and we're just gonna put it into a black

254
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,280
box that puts some algorithm on stuff

255
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:55,100
and then we all are going to be happy

256
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,900
that is that is that is a bad bad

257
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,400
approach to things and the other thing

258
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:01,000
you see here is from the get-go you see

259
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,810
what is related to this particular event

260
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,060
and that becomes

261
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:08,150
the most interesting if you have very

262
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:10,130
unique indicators like that as human you

263
00:15:08,150 --> 00:15:10,520
say uh this IP address looks really

264
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:13,939
weird

265
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:16,160
it smells but I'm not really sure and

266
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,410
then if you see that in your data set of

267
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,750
a couple million data points it is not

268
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:23,030
being flagged but you are sure it is

269
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:26,500
malicious that is that gives a certain

270
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:29,720
value to to such to such an attribute

271
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:32,210
but of course if you see well this is on

272
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,800
in thousand other events you know okay

273
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:39,050
well it's maybe something more generic

274
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:43,849
than that well having evens is cool but

275
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:49,240
how is the actual data stored well we

276
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:53,830
have this pretty standard data model of

277
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:58,420
attributes describing IP addresses

278
00:15:53,830 --> 00:16:03,470
hashes and many different types with

279
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:07,750
their value also as for the event you

280
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:15,350
can attach some tags to give some more

281
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:19,790
context it's yeah with a problem with

282
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:23,210
that it's a pretty simple way of

283
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:27,170
describing things but also in this

284
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:31,250
example we might care in troubles if we

285
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:34,939
had to represent more hashes more files

286
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:38,660
and we would not know which hashes

287
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:42,800
belongs to each file so for this kind of

288
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:47,030
situation we also had have objects that

289
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:49,400
are basically simply containers or all

290
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:54,260
attributes describing the context

291
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:59,870
between each of them

292
00:16:54,260 --> 00:17:02,650
basically same features than the

293
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:09,140
attributes they can have tags they have

294
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:11,839
distribution and also an alias flag want

295
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:14,189
to see about the I will talk about that

296
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:18,579
look in a minute

297
00:17:14,189 --> 00:17:23,290
then with an event you can kind of tell

298
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:28,000
a story with some objects and their

299
00:17:23,290 --> 00:17:30,070
references references are basically the

300
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,600
relations between all the objects you

301
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:40,090
can have in an in an event references

302
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:42,340
can also be between objects and between

303
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:48,790
an object and an attribute we will just

304
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:54,699
see here's a more visual representation

305
00:17:48,790 --> 00:18:01,030
of these objects that are provided again

306
00:17:54,700 --> 00:18:04,510
with the event basically more

307
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:09,360
comfortable with this graph to see that

308
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:12,970
we have a file object and IPE object and

309
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:16,270
all the different relations between them

310
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:19,540
also some relations with external

311
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:22,300
attributes single attributes now the

312
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:24,850
main question here obviously is how do

313
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:26,169
these relation relations come to be are

314
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,120
they a manual thing are they an

315
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:34,150
automatic thing and the underlying

316
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:37,178
philosophy of our platform is you can

317
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:41,500
have both worlds but ideally you sort of

318
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:43,750
automate it also to stimulate the

319
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,720
community at large to think about

320
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:50,050
complex problems in a more algorithmic

321
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,340
way again not the biggest fan of

322
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:53,260
artificial intelligence and machine

323
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:57,280
learning yet I really think that there

324
00:18:53,260 --> 00:19:00,910
is a potential to to use those concepts

325
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:04,270
and then and and all all these quasi

326
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:06,790
philosophies to make thread Intel

327
00:19:04,270 --> 00:19:09,520
sharing a way way better tool then than

328
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:11,610
what it is it's a it I don't want to say

329
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,660
our tool is barebone but it's just so

330
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:15,580
complex that you can really do

331
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:19,320
everything with it you really just have

332
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:19,320
to have to do it

333
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:28,880
well having data is fun but what is

334
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:34,610
really important is the context behind

335
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:37,670
what makes the data actionable so what

336
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:41,330
can the data be used for what who can we

337
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:44,179
give the information to what concerns is

338
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:47,600
the information trying to address and so

339
00:19:44,179 --> 00:19:51,470
on for those concerns we have multiple

340
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:55,159
flexible ways of adding context such as

341
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:59,630
the tags the galaxies so basically the

342
00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:03,679
tags are simple way of data

343
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:13,030
classification for an event or an

344
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:17,630
attribute mappings cludes around 80

345
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:21,830
existing tax enemies you can also create

346
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:27,380
your own ones imagine with this example

347
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:29,919
of TLP you can also filter data with

348
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:33,320
using those tags perhaps you want to

349
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:36,080
synchronize data that is only TLP white

350
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:40,460
or you want to restrict exporting data

351
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:43,580
that is TLP red for that purpose

352
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:47,179
classification must be used globally to

353
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:49,100
be efficient and I really motivate you

354
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:50,780
to check out all the taxonomies that are

355
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,270
out there because you will also see that

356
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:55,129
it doesn't only include technical

357
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:58,720
taxonomy but it might actually have a

358
00:20:55,130 --> 00:21:01,540
drugs taxonomy where you have a certain

359
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,679
type of chemical substance

360
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:05,750
classification so it's really a taxonomy

361
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,570
at large and that shows you that the

362
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:10,580
broader picture of what this information

363
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:13,070
sharing platform is really about it's

364
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,990
about information the am again christian

365
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:18,500
explained it's sort of a historical

366
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:21,320
thing but it's not only about technical

367
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:23,360
attributes but it can be about any any

368
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,330
information any data point you can sort

369
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:30,870
of enrich with with with in this case

370
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:34,199
with with tags another

371
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:37,500
way of giving context is what we call it

372
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:45,710
galaxies that are basically describing

373
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:51,000
if the event is has some attack patterns

374
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:55,640
attached those indicators are actually

375
00:21:51,000 --> 00:22:00,230
describing a certain tool we're also

376
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:04,490
supporting the matter attack matrix

377
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:09,179
which is basically a kind of list of

378
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:12,840
Iraq pattern that you can visually and

379
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:20,580
graphically attach to an event or an

380
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:25,159
attribute so I'm going to show you after

381
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:27,800
Steve's demo the rest client we

382
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:32,780
implemented in Mis

383
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:32,780
next slide all right

384
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:46,830
I will give you a quick rundown on what

385
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:49,350
all of that theory looks like in in

386
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:53,100
practice first off if you want to test

387
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:58,620
it like really follow later what I show

388
00:22:53,100 --> 00:23:01,139
you now we have automatically generated

389
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:03,239
virtual machines in VMware and the box

390
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:09,180
format that get generated each time

391
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:11,100
there is a commit in github site notes

392
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:13,470
that is really neat if you need to do

393
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:16,350
testing or if you have a large user base

394
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:19,650
that sometimes says hey this broke

395
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:21,620
between commit a and commit B now I have

396
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:24,870
an more or less easy way of just

397
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:28,439
downloading a self-contained and in

398
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:32,610
theory working image of of our fairly

399
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:35,850
complex software with yesterday someone

400
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:38,219
explained it as a dependency hell which

401
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:40,560
I must admit yes it partially is

402
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:45,810
nevertheless it is it is powerful as

403
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:47,970
such so if you boot up the the virtual

404
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:51,690
machine for the first time you're asked

405
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:54,300
to log in the standard password is admin

406
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:57,270
at admin dot test the password is admin

407
00:23:54,300 --> 00:24:04,169
and you will be asked to change that

408
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:07,650
password fun fact I wrote buggy code the

409
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:11,220
generator used as a username and

410
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:13,920
password combo for SSH miss password one

411
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,780
two three four at the last conference

412
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,640
someone tried to install it on the live

413
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:20,550
server on the internet it took 30

414
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:23,130
minutes to be owned with Miss password

415
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:26,180
one two three four I'm not too proud

416
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:28,710
about the oversight but its historical

417
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:31,260
nevertheless this shows you how how fast

418
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:33,480
it is and yeah there's our combo and

419
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:36,629
some database where they do automated

420
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,790
attacks obviously also meaning because

421
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:43,140
the password is still miss one two three

422
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:45,930
four in the VM don't deploy the VM on a

423
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:48,030
public IP address sounds obvious but

424
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:50,730
sometimes you just deploy by mistake

425
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:51,810
once you logged in you see the the first

426
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:54,750
screen that tells

427
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:56,610
who you are which-which your user is and

428
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:59,190
straightaway you also see oh there's an

429
00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:02,790
authentication key this key generally is

430
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:06,960
used for automation for your PI miss a

431
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:09,030
API calls be careful it matters which

432
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:12,570
user you use create a synchronization

433
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:14,490
user or an API user that is strictly

434
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:17,010
limited to whatever data it should get

435
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:19,860
got at because now I am the site

436
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:22,980
administrator meaning if I have 500

437
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:25,520
organizations on my instance I can see

438
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:28,500
all these organizations and their data

439
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,760
which is for obvious reasons because you

440
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:33,660
do need in a community one site

441
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,750
administrator that can actually just

442
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:38,670
manage everything whereas an

443
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:41,130
organizational admin would only see his

444
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:44,810
organization the site admin sees all the

445
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:48,120
organization's the home screen is very

446
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:50,159
sad and empty in the beginning this is

447
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:51,719
your main view especially as an analyst

448
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,910
where you would also you would see all

449
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:57,000
the events that are are being added

450
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:58,980
either manually or automatically I will

451
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:02,130
now show you how you can quickly just

452
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:06,210
populate an empty an empty mis instance

453
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:08,400
with a feed we have a plethora of feeds

454
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:11,580
already included they are all open

455
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:13,800
source intelligence feeds ideally if you

456
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:16,439
ingest a feed you would ingest it with

457
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:18,389
the Mis format because it is lossless

458
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:21,990
and you will have all the information

459
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:24,960
but of course you can also use other

460
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:27,420
sources like if you have only a CSV feed

461
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:31,200
or something you can also inject ingest

462
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:34,520
that from third-party vendors so I just

463
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:38,700
need to select and enable my feed and

464
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:41,430
once I have enabled it I I just download

465
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:43,890
it so if I now say this enabled feed

466
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:46,800
fetch all events what this does it will

467
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:49,070
now populate my my information sharing

468
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:54,389
platform with whatever data is already

469
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:58,770
included in in that feed a cool thing we

470
00:26:54,390 --> 00:27:01,830
have is the feed overlap matrix meaning

471
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:03,840
imagine you have five data feeds one or

472
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:06,449
two are commercial you pay

473
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,939
thousand bucks a month for it and they

474
00:27:06,450 --> 00:27:11,370
promise you very very very unique feed

475
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:14,460
with very unique indicators how can you

476
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:20,489
check that you cannot really but what

477
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:22,920
you can do is use the the overlap matrix

478
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:24,450
because then you will see okay here are

479
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:28,680
all the feeds that are for example

480
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:31,500
activated on miss proof oh there's some

481
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:32,880
that are 50 percent overlapping with

482
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,190
each other or maybe 20 percent

483
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,290
overlapping with each other it's an easy

484
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:40,500
test to see whether you you get value

485
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:43,440
value for your for your data when you

486
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:45,480
when you have such such feats let's see

487
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,730
if it has actually populated anything

488
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:51,090
and yes you see now slowly but surely

489
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:54,090
data is coming in this synchronization

490
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:56,399
process is very timely if you have a

491
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:58,980
slow internet connection so this will

492
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:03,620
now take quite a while and you see the

493
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:07,650
second event here already has way over

494
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:11,780
1,700 attributes so I would suggest we

495
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:16,170
quickly create an small event ourselves

496
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:19,410
for example we might have seen an apt 32

497
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:25,560
thing on the paste side you would then

498
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:27,630
generally add a good descriptive a name

499
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:30,810
to it and then the most important thing

500
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:32,610
because again think sharing how how do I

501
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:35,669
share it do I share it only with

502
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:39,090
organizations that are being are logging

503
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:40,860
into this miss instance or do would I

504
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:42,330
also share it with organizations that

505
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:44,219
have other missed instances

506
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:46,340
automatically synchronizing my with

507
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:49,440
myself and what if these organizations

508
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:51,780
have other organizations behind them who

509
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,780
synchronize so the distribution level

510
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:58,470
would be the first and foremost a place

511
00:28:54,780 --> 00:29:00,660
to sort of select how far does this

512
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:03,600
event want to travel through the network

513
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:06,870
in our case if I say your organization

514
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:10,230
only if my organization would be assured

515
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:14,520
I would only share it with the Oster

516
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:16,590
organization on on my Mis

517
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:19,670
installation if I say this community

518
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:22,649
only that means well whoever is

519
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:25,440
connected onto this platform they will

520
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:27,750
get that event if I if I share it with

521
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:30,210
them and then connected communities is

522
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:33,990
basically one hop further if there is a

523
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:36,390
company that syncs with me just directly

524
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:38,190
one-to-one I will sync it there as well

525
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:40,650
but it will stop there and then

526
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:42,450
basically all communities means it will

527
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:46,680
go through the entire network if there's

528
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:49,850
50 machines connected it will basically

529
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:51,710
travel travel towards all those

530
00:29:49,850 --> 00:29:55,620
connected machines

531
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:59,340
okey-dokey this is my first event best

532
00:29:55,620 --> 00:30:01,860
practice okay let's add a tag I would

533
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:05,220
say that maybe i want to t LP classify

534
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:07,020
this this might be an event that is TLP

535
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:09,090
white worthy because i found it in a

536
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:12,180
paste side so maybe i want to share that

537
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:13,649
to everyone so i add this tag and i

538
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:15,870
again bear in mind if i would be

539
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:18,480
synchronizing i could say on my sync

540
00:30:15,870 --> 00:30:20,250
link i could say okay if you try to

541
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,990
synchronize something tagged with TLP

542
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:25,590
right don't worry about it just push it

543
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:28,380
through if it's TLP red discard it now

544
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:30,810
how do i populate it there's a fairly

545
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:37,350
simple but effective free text import

546
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:39,960
tool where if I now have my my paste

547
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:42,919
with all these indicator of compromising

548
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:47,940
I would just simply copy paste it and

549
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:54,570
submit it to miss what it does now is it

550
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:56,970
will offer me some presets by what it

551
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:59,100
thinks it is for example here mood or

552
00:30:56,970 --> 00:31:03,660
JPEG URL thing oh that's the network

553
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:06,120
activity of type URL or Big Mac to JPEG

554
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:09,930
that might be actually a file and now I

555
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:12,989
can basically find you how I want this

556
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:17,280
to be attached to my event the IDS flag

557
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:22,110
means that if this is set it will be

558
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:25,789
exported to for example my my surakarta

559
00:31:22,110 --> 00:31:28,879
rule set or the rule set that I used to

560
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:31,610
to fine-tune my firewalls so you want to

561
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,559
be careful here and as as a colleague

562
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:36,020
pointed out for example we have a very

563
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:38,029
generic thing down here Big Mac dot JPEG

564
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:39,799
and that is already marked by default

565
00:31:38,029 --> 00:31:41,870
that might not be good that might be a

566
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:43,820
false positive and here you see this is

567
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:46,370
a rather manual job where you need

568
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:48,529
people who kind of understand more or

569
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:49,908
less what's what they are doing once

570
00:31:48,529 --> 00:31:52,010
this is done you submit all the

571
00:31:49,909 --> 00:31:54,230
attributes what it does now it sort of

572
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:56,059
ingests them but it will go into a

573
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:58,669
background job where does all the

574
00:31:56,059 --> 00:32:01,039
enrichment so for example there is a URL

575
00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:02,990
and you want to get the Whois data of

576
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:04,908
that URL it's gone of that a domain name

577
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:08,210
it's basically now doing all these looks

578
00:32:04,909 --> 00:32:09,289
lookups oh it is actually a domain hmm

579
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:11,450
does it have an IP address

580
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:14,090
it's a Bitcoin address does it actually

581
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:15,440
have any activity on the Bitcoin address

582
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:17,449
and so on and so forth so that is

583
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,760
happening now in the background and as

584
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:24,830
we reload we should see that now we have

585
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:28,629
an an event with a main event ATT 32

586
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:31,189
blah and then with the relevant

587
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:33,770
attributes attached to that event and

588
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:38,320
now and you will see this is what it is

589
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:45,320
complex I say okay well this particular

590
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:49,730
URL is actually TLP green so now I can

591
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:53,230
tag only that URL as TLP green and again

592
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:57,020
all my filtering rules around that which

593
00:32:53,230 --> 00:33:02,240
would act accordingly okay how many

594
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:05,720
minutes do I have five more okay great

595
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:08,059
so we'll show the the rest client next

596
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:11,690
because obviously now we have a lot of

597
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:15,168
data in our instance but what can I now

598
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:17,029
do with that data and this is also our

599
00:33:15,169 --> 00:33:20,149
our our stick where we want to motivate

600
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:22,370
you to try and just automate it as much

601
00:33:20,149 --> 00:33:23,899
as you can use Python use it in scripts

602
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:25,760
and so on and so forth Kristin's gonna

603
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:27,879
show you how that is done in a few easy

604
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,879
steps

605
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:51,549
so you have our home page we go to resk

606
00:33:46,029 --> 00:33:54,909
client so with the rest clients you can

607
00:33:51,549 --> 00:33:59,279
basically do many different things such

608
00:33:54,909 --> 00:34:03,100
as add attributes are events edit them

609
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:06,940
what we want to show here today is the

610
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:12,969
rest search where you can filter some

611
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:17,770
data with some and export it for

612
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:22,500
instance as so one of the format's here

613
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:26,770
so what is important is we have some

614
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:30,960
mandatory field obviously the written

615
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:38,009
format is important we will choose Jason

616
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:45,909
because it's the one we like with miss

617
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:48,790
type okay I want some IP sources and I

618
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:57,070
will also not want to show all the IP

619
00:34:48,790 --> 00:35:02,369
source fit but the last ones from the

620
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:07,180
last two days what show the reason

621
00:35:02,369 --> 00:35:14,130
okay then we have the results okay what

622
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:18,629
is interesting here is we have program

623
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:18,630
programmatic away of doing it

624
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:26,050
automatically with curl or either with

625
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:28,839
the Python API Primus and all the

626
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:32,770
commands are shown as well if you have

627
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:37,980
troubles building your own queries we

628
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:46,870
also have query builder helping you

629
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:54,880
doing it so just have the same one here

630
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:59,910
and I care in the last two days and here

631
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:02,890
we can inject it and have the exact same

632
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:05,950
result like that kind of stuff you can

633
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:07,750
also bookmark because again well maybe

634
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:09,460
you have an operator that wants to use

635
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:13,690
this but it's not necessarily very

636
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:17,260
versed in in writing and thinking

637
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:19,840
dreaming Jason then the the bookmark

638
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:22,750
queries are fairly handy but you see

639
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:24,640
like with the Python snippet we have

640
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:26,680
there it's very easy to kind of get

641
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,480
started you use the query builder to

642
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,799
make something more or less interesting

643
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:33,610
of the data you want to get out and then

644
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:36,160
you can use the the the script snippet

645
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:39,700
that that gets produced further on of

646
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:43,210
course the Primus API has a plethora of

647
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:46,359
examples it is close to obscene how much

648
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:48,670
FLV know who is the main API developer

649
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:51,160
has included and there's also a Jupiter

650
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:53,230
notebook that is really fun because it's

651
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:55,240
way more visual and it also is all

652
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:58,090
tested so that's also one way if you

653
00:36:55,240 --> 00:37:00,430
want to get into automating all that

654
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:02,740
stuff I have a couple more minutes left

655
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:07,839
I guess okay

656
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:09,339
so I can show you something more what

657
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,960
you prefer to do you want to go a little

658
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:13,480
bit off track and do something a little

659
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:18,850
bit more experimental or shall we go

660
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:19,590
with the usual shtick I don't know not

661
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:23,529
too much

662
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:28,650
two minutes okay okay well then let's go

663
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:28,650
off the deep end sound

664
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,090
no sound

665
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:45,899
no sound that is very disappointing

666
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:48,910
because it doesn't work without sound

667
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:52,780
well maybe it does well basically this

668
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:55,149
is a flim bus and they now show how the

669
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:57,670
flim bus is actually made and what the

670
00:37:55,150 --> 00:38:03,339
different steps are to create such a

671
00:37:57,670 --> 00:38:06,160
very high precision device and the

672
00:38:03,339 --> 00:38:09,400
overall idea was how valuable is what we

673
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:14,770
see there what's what do we take from

674
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:21,130
this it's informational maybe how good

675
00:38:14,770 --> 00:38:26,710
this information is doubtful at best so

676
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:29,220
yeah basically the granddad wondered he

677
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:33,550
was always interested to know how these

678
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:35,560
plum buses are being made and this is

679
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:38,200
sort of the self criticizing part of the

680
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:40,299
talk where if you have four thousand

681
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:43,450
organizations sharing data with each

682
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:46,540
other it might just be a big pile of

683
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:48,399
trash I'm not saying the data is trash

684
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,290
but I'm saying that is an issue and that

685
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,540
is an issue we need to sort of solve and

686
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:54,750
if there are big vendors out there who

687
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:56,890
say they have sold it for you with some

688
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:59,140
flim bus device where you don't really

689
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:02,500
know how it works well I don't know

690
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:06,609
think again we are now working on a

691
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:08,050
decaying model where we say okay you

692
00:39:06,609 --> 00:39:10,720
have certain indicators like IP

693
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:12,940
addresses phishing URLs how does not

694
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,649
decay it's easy with milk it's more

695
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:16,330
difficult with a with a phishing address

696
00:39:14,650 --> 00:39:19,150
because even if it's gone is it really

697
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:21,848
gone or has it moved same with IP

698
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:23,740
addresses so basically which we're

699
00:39:21,849 --> 00:39:26,800
trying to implement some fancy

700
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:28,180
mathematics to sort of say okay these

701
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,220
are the source organizations who have

702
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:32,589
had that they have a certain trust

703
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:34,629
relationship they are trusted because

704
00:39:32,589 --> 00:39:36,190
they are for example assert they know

705
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:39,849
what they're doing so that has a

706
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:41,560
different trust level versus this new

707
00:39:39,849 --> 00:39:44,820
company who might share stuff and we

708
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:48,250
don't really know how valuable that is

709
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:50,260
so the combination of decaying

710
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:52,300
indicators of compromise and putting a

711
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:54,850
certain value on it will be extremely

712
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:56,860
important for any information sharing

713
00:39:54,850 --> 00:40:00,190
platform to actually be be useful

714
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:01,960
especially for analysis because you see

715
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:05,830
what happens at the moment attribution

716
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:08,410
is a big fat mess that is being made

717
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:10,720
worse by vendors who want to slap a name

718
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:13,270
on something and and and off you go and

719
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:15,549
the same thing for for exploits for

720
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:17,230
example how valuable is an exploded an

721
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:20,140
exploit becomes less valuable over time

722
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:22,000
and so on and so forth I think my our

723
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:25,660
time is up with that

724
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:30,010
I want to thank Christian very much for

725
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:32,620
for having given us a helping hand in in

726
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:36,040
making this year's presentation that

727
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:37,839
assert happened because Michael who had

728
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:40,720
a couple of other workshops as well was

729
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:43,350
was busy so I thank you very much for

730
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:48,450
this thanks

731
00:40:43,350 --> 00:40:51,040
[Applause]

732
00:40:48,450 --> 00:40:52,509
do we have a quick question very very

733
00:40:51,040 --> 00:41:01,690
short of time but does anyone have any

734
00:40:52,510 --> 00:41:06,190
questions very interested in decay how

735
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:10,060
soon that we can use so there is a test

736
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:14,530
branch a test decaying branch where you

737
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:17,520
basically have an additional field where

738
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:20,560
you can add a decay score that is very

739
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,630
simple at this point of time where you

740
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:25,840
can just give it a numerical value in

741
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:27,670
days but the other more experimental

742
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:30,490
branch has actually also the weighting

743
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:33,700
score included in that so it's it decays

744
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:35,410
not linearly linearly but in a little

745
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:38,319
bit more of a fancy way we wrote two

746
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:39,549
papers about that they are okay they are

747
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,740
not brilliant but they are good enough

748
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:44,020
to have a good idea and we now try to

749
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:45,549
implement our own papers in Intimus

750
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:47,440
which is more challenging than we

751
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:50,950
thought because on paper it's actually

752
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:56,560
pretty clear but in implementation and

753
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:59,290
not so much anything else well if we can

754
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,710
give Steven Christian a big applause

755
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:03,389
thank you very much to us

756
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:03,389
[Applause]
