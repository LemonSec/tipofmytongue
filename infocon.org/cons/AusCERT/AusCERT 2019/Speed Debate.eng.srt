coming up may tell us about capture the

208
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:38,669
flag very popular little event over the

209
00:08:32,759 --> 00:08:40,649
last few days howdy so we had a capture

210
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:44,010
the flag challenge over the last two

211
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:46,050
days so the team I think put in close to

212
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:48,600
about a hundred days worth of effort

213
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:53,609
into it so you know give a round of

214
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:55,949
applause to the complex team and we do

215
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:58,170
have a winner and the team members qut

216
00:08:55,949 --> 00:09:01,550
you Cuba I saw them running out the door

217
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:04,260
so I'll I'll give this prize to them oh

218
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:06,779
I'll talk through the challenge it's

219
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,000
basically you need to compromise a IT

220
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:10,769
network like a Windows domain to then

221
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,990
pivot through it to an OT networks an

222
00:09:10,769 --> 00:09:15,480
operational technology network so what

223
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:18,029
we do there we have series of houses we

224
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,459
have a water plant as well here we are

225
00:09:18,029 --> 00:09:22,529
got we have a water plant and we have

226
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:24,959
traffic light system and we have a

227
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:27,199
series of streetlights as well so if

228
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,579
you're able to compromise all those bits

229
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:32,849
especially their houses and compromise

230
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:34,769
the quote unquote smart smart meters

231
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,360
that are in there it's actually

232
00:09:34,769 --> 00:09:38,310
literally not literally a lot of fire

233
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,740
but mock light of fire and through a

234
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:42,388
series of pipes smoke actually starts

235
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:44,730
pouring out of them so it's so it's

236
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:46,260
really really cool so we are packing it

237
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:47,639
up but I think most of the people have

238
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,610
actually seen it some people have seen

239
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:51,560
in action as well so

240
00:09:49,610 --> 00:10:05,089
we do have the team here fantastic so

241
00:09:51,560 --> 00:10:07,250
that's UQ QUT team wanted a stress just

242
00:10:05,089 --> 00:10:09,380
uke you know environment of QUT

243
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:11,690

244
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,920

00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,839
boots over the last couple of days now

250
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,029
we move to the annual also its plea

251
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:24,290
debate this is a bit of fun debating

252
00:10:23,029 --> 00:10:26,540
like you have never seen it before

253
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,920
unless you've been to all sir any time

254
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,810
in the last 10 years where this has

255
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,819
become an absolute highlight of the

256
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:35,589
event of the calendar what we do here is

257
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,589
we have rather than your old-fashioned

258
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:42,170
minutes each everybody at the end we did

259
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:43,760
a few years ago thought bugger let's get

260
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:46,310
through as many topics as we possibly

261
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,390
can in the space of one session so the

262
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,050
way we do that is we live in every one

263
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,120
to one minute

264
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:51,920
speaking one minute and I will be

265
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:55,399
ruthless on that we're going to go

266
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:58,430
through six topics six count them six

267
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:00,230
topics each one divided by three on the

268
00:10:58,430 --> 00:11:01,819
affirmative three on the negative at the

269
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:05,000
end of it I throw to you guys for a vote

270
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:08,209

00:11:55,689 --> 00:12:00,339
handheld microphones there so as I say

285
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,509

286
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:03,430
sure the handheld microphones are

287
00:12:01,509 --> 00:12:04,240
appropriately passed to them can someone

288
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,800
who's quick can we just grab the

289
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,970
microphones each just a quick word into

290
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,579

291

00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:13,149
good fantastic you've got one there

293
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:15,430
Brian is that microphone working you

294
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:19,209
know yes fanta incorrect answer good

295
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:22,059
eventually MIGO yes okay let's see we

296
00:12:19,209 --> 00:12:24,660
got our first topic our first topic for

297
00:12:22,059 --> 00:12:28,870
this evening personalized ads are

298
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:31,149
morally wrong personalized ads are

299
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:34,600
morally wrong Colby Jesse and Jake

300
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:39,850
versus Mikko Brad and Troy Colby your

301
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:43,540
one minute starts now personalized ads a

302
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:46,180
morally wrong because machine learning

303
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,910
is only as good as your training set is

304
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:51,660
so until like every single person in

305
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:54,790
this audience goes homes and buyers a

306
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:56,730
Amazon Alexa and a Google home and kind

307
00:12:54,790 --> 00:13:00,819
of straps them to their body with like a

308
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:03,699
portable power bank they're not really

309
00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:06,670
gonna know enough about us so when I

310
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:10,149
bought a mountain bike about a few

311
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:13,300
months ago all it did was ask if I

312
00:13:10,149 --> 00:13:15,939
wanted to buy another mountain bike it

313
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:18,189
never really went anywhere beyond that

314
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:20,230
and I think to have such a terrible

315
00:13:18,189 --> 00:13:23,980
training set and still use machine

316
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:25,540
learning is pretty morally bankrupt okay

317
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:28,269
thank very much Bobby give him a round

318
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:30,459
of applause first breaker for the

319
00:13:28,269 --> 00:13:30,970
opposition and negating that topic take

320
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:33,420
it away

321
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,420
Mikko

322
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:25,770
okay thank you very much big on taking

323
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:30,680
the position of personalized ads ah

324
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:30,680
morally wrong over to you Jesse Oh

325
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,020
[Music]

326
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:28,680
[Music]

327
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:32,880
are you guys thinking too much Jessie

328
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:34,800
Owen arguing against the topic to

329
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:39,779
personalize hats are morally wrong take

330
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:41,579
it away Brad Dunkin uh first of all I

331
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:45,260
hired a speechwriter to help me prepare

332
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:51,899
to the statement his name is Harry I

333
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:54,060
watch a lot of porn a lot of porn how

334
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:55,649
else am I going to find out about the

335
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,109
newest developments in my particular

336
00:15:55,649 --> 00:16:01,320
fetish without personalized

337
00:15:58,110 --> 00:16:03,570
advertisements I sure as hell am NOT

338
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:06,450
going to search the internet for some of

339
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:11,690
the things I am curious about

340
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:14,760
I enjoy booths very very cheap booze

341
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:22,200
without personalized ads how can I find

342
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:23,730
the cheapest alcohol I like guns how

343
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,130
else can I find the quickest way to

344
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:30,089
obtain a firearm in my local area

345
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:32,070
without registration when you argue

346
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:34,620
against personalized ads you are arguing

347
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:44,070
against porn addicted hard drinking gun

348
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:45,480
enthusiast like myself which I'll go to

349
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:48,209
now a couple of days ago Brett that's

350
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,339
great so closing the debate for the

351
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:51,119
affirmative personalized ads are morally

352
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:54,019
wrong Jake

353
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,019
Carol take it away

354
00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:54,779
thank you very much Jake and to close

355
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:57,539
the debate for the negative take it away

356
00:17:54,779 --> 00:17:59,880
Troy hunt I don't really understand that

357
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:01,110
the Kobe argument it's like I like bikes

358
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:03,110
I keep seeing bikes like what's the

359
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:05,340
problem and you're there on a website

360
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:07,889
which you're trying to use for free

361
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:09,360
aniss like here's some bikes I don't see

362
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:10,799
the problem let us see Jesse's problem

363
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,209
either because I'd be very happy to get

364
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,889
more personalized ads because I have so

365
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:15,120
much trouble shopping I'd love to be

366
00:18:13,889 --> 00:18:17,158
wandering around the internet and

367
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,320
actually figuring out what I should buy

368
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:21,539
by the site itself it would make my

369
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:22,889
whole Christmas thing a lot easier so

370
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:24,929
the thing is like if we want to keep

371
00:18:22,889 --> 00:18:26,699
getting things for free and we need to

372
00:18:24,929 --> 00:18:28,830
have some targeted information we gotta

373
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,330
get ads one way or the other I'd much

374
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:31,980
rather see stuff that's relevant to me

375
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:34,649
and it's gonna make my life easier I'd

376
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,659
be happy to have more sensors in my home

377
00:18:34,649 --> 00:18:38,189
looking at more of my stuff if it will

378
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:39,600
help me get better things because I'm

379
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:41,759
just useless that actually going out and

380
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,230
buying stuff of my own free volition so

381
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:47,039
I'm more tracking more targeting and I

382
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:50,009
think we'll all be a lot happier there

383
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,570
you go you've heard both sides over to

384
00:18:50,009 --> 00:18:53,759
you now take the app and you've got a

385
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:56,759
few seconds to cast your vote on this

386
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:57,840
first topic personalized ads are morally

387
00:18:56,759 --> 00:19:00,029
wrong did you come down on the side of

388
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,549
strap-on Alexis multiple mountain bikes

389
00:19:00,029 --> 00:19:04,649
and amateur a purists or adult diapers

390
00:19:02,549 --> 00:19:08,269
fetish porn and guns you've got a few

391
00:19:04,649 --> 00:19:08,268
seconds to lodge your vote there

392
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:37,460
a resounding wind or the negative

393
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:38,930
congratulations Mikko Brad and Troy okay

394
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:41,120
now I should have pointed out before

395
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:43,220
that our first debate I will clarify now

396
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,040
I've encouraged all of our speakers

397
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:49,100
today to be provocative it's the last

398
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:51,139
session of the of the conference really

399
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,090
throw it out there if you feel sort of

400
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:55,280
six out of ten on a topic push it out to

401
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:56,360
twelve or thirteen Brad I get the

402
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,560
impression didn't even need that

403
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,629
instruction I love your work in

404
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:01,129
particular Brad

405
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:02,420
but in all seriousness this is this is

406
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:04,280
septum with provoking a bit of thought

407
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:06,620
having a bit of fun nothing that is said

408
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:08,810
here on stage can be taken away as the

409
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,820
actual held position of individuals or

410
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:12,919
the organization's they happen to be

411
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:17,419
from as we move onto our second topic

412
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:20,440
apps need a code worthy certificate much

413
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:23,090
like cars require a Road worthy

414
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,100
certificate should apps have a code

415
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:27,800
worthy certificate just and Heidi and

416
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:30,770
Jesse will be saying they do Kolby Brad

417
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:32,870
and Jake will be saying they don't so to

418
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:34,340
commence absolute a code worthy

419
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:36,320
certificate much like cars require a

420
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:39,429
road were these difficut take it away

421
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,429

[Music]

425
00:21:40,789 --> 00:21:47,969
Justin first speaker for the negative

426
00:21:46,169 --> 00:21:51,379
speaking against code worthy

427
00:21:47,969 --> 00:21:51,379
certificates take it away Kobe Pryor

428
00:21:51,559 --> 00:21:58,979
well I kind of like docker hub I don't

429
00:21:55,499 --> 00:22:00,749
want that to go away but beyond that a

430
00:21:58,979 --> 00:22:03,269
big difference between New South Wales

431
00:22:00,749 --> 00:22:05,879
and Queensland roadworthy certificates

432
00:22:03,269 --> 00:22:09,269
for cars is in New South Wales you have

433
00:22:05,879 --> 00:22:10,939
to get it every single year and someone

434
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:14,549
kind of just walks up kicks your tyre

435
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:17,159
ask for $500 and you see him again next

436
00:22:14,549 --> 00:22:21,059
year in Queensland they just kind of

437
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:26,429
sign up once but and said you pay $3,000

438
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:28,499
and it's kind of good forever so I don't

439
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:31,109
know how that maps out to the the

440
00:22:28,499 --> 00:22:35,399
practical real-world life but if you

441
00:22:31,109 --> 00:22:36,869
gave a a code worthy certificate for

442
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:39,089
some of the apps which were around 10

443
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:41,299
years ago I'd not sure how long they

444
00:22:39,089 --> 00:22:46,019
would live on the Internet today

445
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:47,039
thank you very much Colby now we're

446
00:22:46,019 --> 00:22:49,619
gonna hear from the first time this

447
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,539
afternoon on the affirmative in favor of

448
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:56,039
Cobo exhibits Heidi winner take it away

449
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:57,809
Heidi so apps definitely need a code

450
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:00,089
worthy certificate much like the cars

451
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:01,619
need a Road worthy certificate because

452
00:23:00,089 --> 00:23:03,450
it's definitely more things that we can

453
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:03,750
issue and make money from in the long

454
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,909
term

455
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:11,159
with a cybersecurity benefit so we can

456
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:13,140
afford more conferences like today but

457
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:15,090
let's take it seriously at the end of

458
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:16,860
the day what we actually really need is

459
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:19,260
to understand that the applications are

460
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:21,360
safe so that Brad can watch is out of

461
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,650
porn finish the sites and guns and not

462
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,418
have to worry about that particular

463
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:26,490
information being leaked publicly on the

464
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:28,140
internet so we understand that those

465
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:31,080
billions and billions of records that

466
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:33,299
justin referenced earlier that may or

467
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:35,100
may not have actually been leaked are

468
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:38,158
actually never gonna be happening again

469
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:41,449
so I just definitely need a code worthy

470
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:43,799
certificate but not like the cars as

471
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:45,990
Colby said because it's different in

472
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:48,600
every state we need to understand this

473
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:50,909
at a federal and a national inner and an

474
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,139
international level that code where

475
00:23:50,909 --> 00:23:53,669
these certificates are definitely

476
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:56,480
necessary Oh

477
00:23:53,669 --> 00:24:00,120
bring it in on 59 seconds well Don Hardy

478
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:02,820
guy to negate the concept of the card

479
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:04,590
worthy certificate it's the drunken

480
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:07,168
gun-toting porn fetishist himself brat

481
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:09,299
take it away my friend through an

482
00:24:07,169 --> 00:24:11,340
initial misunderstanding I thought my

483
00:24:09,299 --> 00:24:14,580
speechwriter Harry had graduated from

484
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:16,709
Oxford University but it turns out he

485
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:21,299
merely stated he was proficient in the

486
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:24,600
use of an Oxford comma a code where the

487
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:28,850
certificate is a nice idea but do you

488
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:31,678
know what else is nice ideal communism

489
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:34,350
both communism and these proposed

490
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:36,289
certificates required bureaucracy and

491
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:39,330
this dictatorship of the proletariat

492
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:41,730
will make all our decisions for us as

493
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:45,539
far as this issue is concerned do we

494
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:49,530
really want to mix commie politics into

495
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:51,870
the code worthiness of our apps when you

496
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:56,790

yeah open-source is totally open just

540
00:28:54,340 --> 00:29:01,559
organized plagiarism like every single

541
00:28:57,190 --> 00:29:04,480
time you type out curl paste in a URL

542
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:06,970
endpoint and throw in a dash K because

543
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,630
you're fast and loose and use pipe at

544
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:13,570
the bash that's stealing and every time

545
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:16,480
you do a get cloned you're just stealing

546
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:19,510
off someone else the only way it's not

547
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:22,030
stealing is if money is exchanged that's

548
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:24,879
why we all need to put our all of our

549
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:28,960
API endpoints and our you know github z'

550

all behind some kind of Bitcoin right

551
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:33,250
limited access where we're paying for

552
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,610
what we're getting because that way it's

553
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:38,350
it's a purchase it's not stealing

554

Brian or yours what a crock of shit okay

559
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:54,640
open source is a gift it's a manor it's

560
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,860
a part of what we thrive on in the

561
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,380
Internet it's the world in which we live

562
00:29:56,860 --> 00:30:01,120
this myriad of ions and neutrons

563
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:02,620
bouncing around because we interplay

564
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,090
with it every day you imagine if we had

565
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:05,770
a gatekeeper to go through everything

566
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:07,899
and you think that there's no money

567
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:09,220
being exchanged my god have you look at

568
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:11,020
the Bitcoin the organized crime the

569
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:13,840
cyber crime that's occurring every day

570
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:16,540
it's the the underground economy of what

571
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,240
exists is you know blessed by the virtue

572
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:21,520
of such freedom that we express and

573
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:22,960
jealously guard I mean when you look at

574
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:26,620
the thing is open sources organized

575
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:29,620
plagiarism plagiarism a type of IP theft

576
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:32,100
we have students around the world that

577
00:30:29,620 --> 00:30:35,189
thrive on plagiarism they need

578
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:37,990
plagiarism to get through their studies

579
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:40,150
actually there are industries they

580
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:42,880
support in places like China and in

581
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:44,380
India that it's the economy is supported

582
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,750
by the whole idea of writing assignments

583
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:48,850
for other people but you know what open

584
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:51,100

one hour of the year as much as this

597
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:06,030
where I hear an audience laughing so

598
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:09,810
hard at jokes and I have no fucking idea

611
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:18,880
Brad my speechwriter Harry must be

612
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:22,090
associated with an important government

613
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:25,230
or military organization he has the term

614
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:29,649
4/20 peppered throughout his resume a

615

resume riddled with Oxford commas Harry

616
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:35,110
also agrees that open source is

617
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:37,629
organized plagiarism the reason is

618
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:39,459
because all the good ideas in software

619
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:42,040
development up to this point have

620
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:44,020
already been done operating systems

621
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:46,360
applications we've already discussed

622
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:48,760
part of this already but for any new

623
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:51,219
ideas that will eventually become

624
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:54,640
open-source let the commercial vendors

625
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:58,090
market an application or a novel concept

626
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:01,600
and see if it works and then open source

627
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:04,659
can swoop in and provide an alternative

628
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:07,540

temperature's going down or else we're

664
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:53,200
all gonna choke and die and we're kind

665
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:54,910
of doing the same thing on on

666
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,700
information now we're choking and dying

667
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:58,779
on disinformation on the internet so

668
00:36:57,700 --> 00:37:01,140
anyone being on Facebook or Twitter

669
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:03,400
lately it's like yeah exactly right so

670
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:05,200
this is the problem I'm spending my

671
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:07,090
entire time looking at things at people

672
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,770
at posting and it's taken me like two

673
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:10,930
seconds to fact-check this stuff you

674
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:12,970
know is it on Snopes yes okay job done

675
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:14,770
is it all in capitals yes is it asked me

676
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:16,600
to do something yes okay it's gonna be

677
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:17,800
faked so if I can do it in a couple

678
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,960
minutes so don't know why other people

679
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,370
can't I was just trying to look for some

680
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:23,230
of the worst hoaxes that have been out

681
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:25,600
there and frankly I can't repeat a lot

682
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:26,470
of the ones I just read here but think

683
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,290
about some of the stuff we've been

684
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:30,759
seeing lately kids reading Tide Pods you

685
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:32,259
seen this one because they put out

686
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,570
information on the Internet go this is a

687
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:37,030
good idea let's do this how deep fakes

688
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:38,500
we don't know what to trust anymore one

689
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:40,090
of my favorites here was how you can

690
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:42,280
charge your iphone by putting it in a

691
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:44,980
microwave this is the information that's

692
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:46,240
online we've got to kill this stuff okay

693
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:49,990
thank you very much Troy yeah great

694
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:51,910
stuff okay Colby speak against a Paris

695
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:54,819
Accord for information pollution take it

696
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:56,830
away Colby I feel like you just kind of

697
00:37:54,820 --> 00:38:01,150
listed a bunch of reasons as to why it

698
00:37:56,830 --> 00:38:03,779
misinformation is hilarious and I know

699
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:07,120
as soon as my nephew comes and asked me

700
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:09,400
one day what is the Great Wall of China

701
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:12,940
for I'm gonna tell him it's to keep out

702
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:16,210
the rabbits and if I can't do that I

703
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:17,680
don't want to live in that world the

704
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:20,260
other great thing about like the Paris

705
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:23,649
Accord is it's just so easily

706
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:25,840
enforceable and in the same way that any

707
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:28,120
international law can easily be enforced

708
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:30,430
misinformation will be easily enforced

709
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,880
because everyone's really good at

710
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,859
identifying

711
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:35,920
playing what satire and what isn't

712
00:38:32,859 --> 00:38:39,279
satire and you know the whole thing of

713
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,470
Paris it you know the whole world is

714
00:38:39,279 --> 00:38:45,509
being polluted but the war is only in

715
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:51,399
Paris like what

716
00:38:45,509 --> 00:38:52,839
thank you very much call me Jake you're

717
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:54,369

718
00:38:52,839 --> 00:39:42,009
an Internet Paris Accord take it away

719
00:38:54,369 --> 00:39:45,789
Joe thank you very much Jake powerful

720
00:39:42,009 --> 00:39:47,140
stuff okay now Brian certainly shot out

721
00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:48,039
of the blocks with his last offering I

722
00:39:47,140 --> 00:39:49,598
can't wait to see what he's got on this

723
00:39:48,039 --> 00:39:50,769
one even a speck on the opposition Brian

724
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,480
to the Internet Paris Accord for

725
00:39:50,769 --> 00:39:58,000
information pollution take it away Brian

726
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:59,680
hey what a crock of shit yes have a look

727
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,789
at the Paris Accord it was designed I

728
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:05,379
think in about 2016 if we're now in 2019

729
00:40:03,789 --> 00:40:07,119
and it's just been agreed to by the

730
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:08,740
countries so you know what that tells us

731
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:11,440
that world leaders didn't necessarily

732
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:14,379
agree with it and you know what Donald

733
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:16,900
Trump has just he's already announced

734
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:18,250
he's gonna withdraw I mean mom some may

735
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,450
argue if it's good enough for Donald

736
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:22,420
it's not good enough for us you know

737
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:25,808
what I'm saying and what about pollution

738
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:28,150
if we didn't have pollution we would not

739
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:30,819
have the Greenies movement we would not

740
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:33,029
have global warming think of the

741
00:40:30,819 --> 00:40:38,109
benefits that yields at warmer summers

742
00:40:33,029 --> 00:40:40,420
warmer winters suntan bodies there are

743
00:40:38,109 --> 00:40:42,460
benefits here people now equate the

744
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:44,590
filth in the air to the filth online

745
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:46,930
pornography grew the Internet

746
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:49,930
ladies and gentlemen we should stand

747
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:52,690
proud the free spirit of the Internet

748
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:57,899
rests in the ability to actually have

749
00:40:52,690 --> 00:41:00,240
not have filtering so go for it okay

750
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:02,500
[Applause]

751
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,879
Heidi would you like to close out the

752
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:09,040
argument for the affirmative pleas in

753
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:11,170
favor of an Internet Paris Accord I need

754
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,390
this to be regulated we really need this

755
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:15,340
to be regulated we need to have less

756
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:19,560
flat earthers and more cat memes

757
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:23,530
I need more cheeseburgers I need less

758
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:28,500
flat earth I need less propaganda and I

759
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:31,510
need less tweets from Donald Trump so

760
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:33,910
really in the end this sort of things

761
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:35,800
pretty easy to enforce and all we need

762
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:38,859
to do is to put up some really big

763
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:40,360
firewalls what is it we also need to do

764
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:43,390
make sure people are actually fully

765
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:45,090
curating posts we need to make sure that

766
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:50,259
we're all checking these things and oh

767
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:51,820
wait yeah cuz that's not hard at all but

768
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:53,410
really at the end of the day as long as

769
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:56,740
I can make sure that my Twitter feed has

770
00:41:53,410 --> 00:41:59,460
at least 80% shitposts to 20% actual

771
00:41:56,740 --> 00:42:02,859
factual chrome content I'm ok with that

772
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:05,020
ok thank you very much Heidi our final

773
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:06,730
speaker for the negative arguing against

774
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:09,509
an internet Paris Accord just and

775
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:09,510
Stephen take it away

776
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:36,219
[Music]

777
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:08,620
thank God there you guys toss burner

778
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:10,090

779
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:12,310
affirmative microwaving Mobile's

780
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:13,510
psycholytic sand cat memes we do you

781
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:15,549
support the negative emperor nasi goreng

782
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:17,980
the benefits of global warming and the

783
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:21,370
Adani data mine you had Troy

784
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:25,680
Jake and Heidi on the affirmative Kolby

785
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:28,509
Brian and Justin taking up the negative

786
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:31,620
ten seconds to lodger votes the negative

787
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:31,620
one all three debates so far

788
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:34,960
[Music]

789
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,788
so now starting to worry if there's a

790
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:48,829
Fault in the system not in terms of the

791
00:43:46,789 --> 00:43:49,819
merits of the device but if the negative

792
00:43:48,829 --> 00:43:51,109
one or six that will be interesting

793
00:43:49,819 --> 00:43:55,058
right so the negative again get the

794
00:43:51,109 --> 00:43:57,259
round of applause Kobe Justin and Bryan

795
00:43:55,059 --> 00:43:59,599
now this is going to be interesting this

796
00:43:57,259 --> 00:44:01,960
next topic Valen researchers can do no

797
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,920
wrong they need diplomatic immunity

798
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:05,599
appellant researchers can do no wrong

799
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,369
they need diplomatic immunity exciting

800
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:09,140
for a couple of reasons on the negative

801
00:44:07,369 --> 00:44:12,019
we'll eventually hear from Brad Jesse

802
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:13,700
and Troy but on the affirmative seconds

803
00:44:12,019 --> 00:44:15,649
big is gonna be Mikko third speaker is

804
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:16,729
gonna be Heidi given the way that brian

805
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:18,799
has started

806
00:44:16,729 --> 00:44:19,848
both of these speeches so far by

807
00:44:18,799 --> 00:44:21,979
referring to everything that's happened

808
00:44:19,849 --> 00:44:23,450
previously in the debate as he's gonna

809
00:44:21,979 --> 00:44:24,589
be the very first speaker in the debates

810
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:27,200
it's gonna be varying to see how he

811
00:44:24,589 --> 00:44:28,549
leads off possibly any I'll leave it up

812
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,720
to you take it away Valen researchers

813
00:44:28,549 --> 00:44:32,299
can do no wrong than a diplomatic

814
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:38,118
immunity take it away Brian this is not

815
00:44:32,299 --> 00:44:39,979
a crock of shit we need volatile

816
00:44:38,119 --> 00:44:42,200
researchers vulnerability researchers

817
00:44:39,979 --> 00:44:44,239
okay hackers we need the luck right

818
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:46,819
they're vulnerable to you know don't

819
00:44:44,239 --> 00:44:48,769
welcome they should be enshrined as

820
00:44:46,819 --> 00:44:51,200
national treasures Putin had the right

821
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:52,609
idea he announced that but one of the

822
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,899
national treasures the great treasures

823
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:55,640
of Russia they've got their greatest

824
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:58,670
assets was their covert hacking to

825
00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:01,460
forthright we should actually consider

826
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:03,950
them a protected species we need the

827
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:05,690
freedom of liberalism to be order to

828
00:45:03,950 --> 00:45:07,689
make a difference to give us the cutting

829
00:45:05,690 --> 00:45:09,799
edge in the world that we love today

830
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:13,130
everything of course should be subjected

831
00:45:09,799 --> 00:45:15,170
to rigorous testing and review you start

832
00:45:13,130 --> 00:45:17,719
testing by virtue of guidelines would we

833
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:19,039
actually have the solutions to the

834
00:45:17,719 --> 00:45:21,229
common cold well we don't have that yet

835
00:45:19,039 --> 00:45:23,089
but other things like you know that the

836
00:45:21,229 --> 00:45:24,950
advances in medical sciences they if we

837
00:45:23,089 --> 00:45:27,380
followed strict protocols without

838
00:45:24,950 --> 00:45:29,718
testing and testing the vulnerability

839
00:45:27,380 --> 00:45:31,519
researchers that they do give us the

840
00:45:29,719 --> 00:45:33,589
advantage that puts us on the edge on

841
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:35,689
the roadmap of things good that are good

842
00:45:33,589 --> 00:45:37,749
yeah I think I'll just made shit up then

843
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:40,999
but there you go thank you much Brian

844
00:45:37,749 --> 00:45:42,529
hey Brad's gonna laid us off on the

845
00:45:40,999 --> 00:45:44,598
negative speaking against Vaughn

846
00:45:42,529 --> 00:45:48,140
research is doing it no wrong tackled by

847
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:50,660
Brett my speechwriter Harry has a wide

848
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:53,089
variety of life experiences that have

849
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:54,618
hopefully informed my statements tonight

850
00:45:53,089 --> 00:45:57,700
for example

851
00:45:54,619 --> 00:46:01,369
he lists and part of his experiences

852
00:45:57,700 --> 00:46:03,769
medical testing medicinal testing which

853
00:46:01,369 --> 00:46:08,479
is always for some reason included in

854
00:46:03,769 --> 00:46:10,879
quotation marks in 1984 Libyan embassy

855
00:46:08,479 --> 00:46:13,729
worker in London opened fired a mob of

856
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:16,190
anti-gaddafi protesters outside of his

857
00:46:13,729 --> 00:46:19,368
embassy this killed one police officer

858
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:21,109
and injured eleven others the embassy

859
00:46:19,369 --> 00:46:23,989
staff are eventually kicked out of the

860
00:46:21,109 --> 00:46:27,969
UK and no one was charged with a crime

861
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:30,229
this my friends is diplomatic immunity

862
00:46:27,969 --> 00:46:31,940
additionally diplomatic immunity was

863
00:46:30,229 --> 00:46:35,299
abused by criminals during the movie

864
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:37,099
lethal weapon - which I think resulted

865
00:46:35,299 --> 00:46:38,479
in more deaths but I don't really know

866
00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:41,989
because that wasn't a good movie and I

867
00:46:38,479 --> 00:46:44,598
can hardly remember it anyway an

868
00:46:41,989 --> 00:46:46,729
argument for diplomatic immunity is an

869
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:49,549
argument for murder and vulnerability

870
00:46:46,729 --> 00:46:50,859
researches should not be encouraged to

871
00:46:49,549 --> 00:46:54,259
murder

872
00:46:50,859 --> 00:46:56,779
thank you very much Brad coherent as

873
00:46:54,259 --> 00:47:01,029
always Myka you're on the affirmative

874
00:46:56,779 --> 00:47:01,029

Jesse oh and you're gonna take up the

885
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:12,130
negative saying that valen researchers

886
00:48:10,150 --> 00:48:14,310
do not desert diplomatic immunity take

887
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:14,310

Heidi wrapping it up on the affirmative

895
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:48,710
rollin researchers can do no wrong they

896
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:53,720
need diplomatic immunity take it away

897
00:49:48,710 --> 00:49:54,560
Heidi look if they don't get to come out

898
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,060
of community

899
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:57,650
how are they gonna actually go to DEFCON

900
00:49:56,060 --> 00:50:02,660
get drunk and brag about everything and

901
00:49:57,650 --> 00:50:05,390
not get arrested like but really this is

902
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:07,339
a job imagine going into work one day

903
00:50:05,390 --> 00:50:09,379
and you've just gone and the day before

904
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:10,910
reported some of the stuff that ended up

905
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:14,300
and one of your spam traps or whatever

906
00:50:10,910 --> 00:50:16,580
and people come in after knocking on the

907
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:18,860
door sit you down and go you know it

908
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:20,870
you've done you know why you're here

909
00:50:18,860 --> 00:50:23,260
today it's because you've been knowing

910
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:23,259
your job

911
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:26,770
and we don't have diplomatic immunity

912
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,350
for you because you've been doing your

913
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:31,750
job

914
00:50:28,350 --> 00:50:34,360
look we need people to do these

915
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:36,060
particular pieces of work we need to

916
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:38,110
actually have these vulnerabilities

917
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:39,810
uncovered and we also need to have them

918
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:42,040
reported responsibly

919
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:45,250
they're responsible ones are the good

920
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:47,680
ones of course but at the end of the day

921
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:49,840
we really really need to make sure that

922
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:51,250
we actually treat our vulnerability

923
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:54,840
researchers with the respect they

924
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:58,630
deserve because they can't do any wrong

925
00:50:54,840 --> 00:51:00,700
thank you very much Heidi final speaker

926
00:50:58,630 --> 00:51:01,000
for the debate on the negative take it

927
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:04,480
away

928
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:06,130
Troy stop finding bloody bugs and

929
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,360
everything look at all the problems

930
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:09,040
we're having anything I think about even

931
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:11,140
the eternal blue stuff it was like two

932
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:13,060
years ago this thing is still dishing up

933
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:14,920
the goods if no-one found that it would

934
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:15,730
be fine we wouldn't have the problem in

935
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:18,370
the first place

936
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:19,990
I really don't want to see all the sorts

937
00:51:18,370 --> 00:51:22,210
of vulnerabilities people finding I

938
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:24,100
don't want to say like compromise teddy

939
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:25,810
bears and cars and watches and things

940
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:28,089
like this I mean who really wants to

941
00:51:25,810 --> 00:51:30,100
live in that world if they just let the

942
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:32,260
software developers do their job

943
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:34,720
stop mucking out their code leave it as

944
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:36,430
it is would be a lot better off stop

945
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,109
finding vulnerabilities and sucking data

946
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:39,790
out of systems as well because the last

947
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:41,650
thing you want to do is have more data

948
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:43,540
making ever been poned even bigger and

949
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:45,370
bigger and frankly I would like to break

950
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:46,990
from all that as well so if you could

951
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:48,310
all just stop doing that shit for a

952
00:51:46,990 --> 00:51:52,990
while I think everyone will be a lot

953
00:51:48,310 --> 00:51:54,940
happier thank you they're you God well

954
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:56,770
there you have it compromise teddy bears

955
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:58,750
but pain bug bounty hunters and Luther

956
00:51:56,770 --> 00:52:02,470
weapon two versus hackers as national

957
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:07,870
treasures and protected species log your

958
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:09,640
votes valen researchers Bolen

959
00:52:07,870 --> 00:52:12,330
researchers can do no wrong they need to

960
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,330
keep the money community

961
00:52:19,990 --> 00:52:27,750
Brian amico and Heidi on the affirmative

962
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:27,750
at Brad Jessie Croix on the negative

963
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:41,430
plus away there you go

964
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:45,210
I went for the affirmative ever mickr

965
00:52:41,430 --> 00:52:48,779
party Brian congratulations this brings

966
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:53,390
us to our final topic of the day topic

967
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:56,940
is cyber security is not very important

968
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:58,828
cyber security is not very important

969
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:01,049
Justin Brian and mica will present the

970
00:52:58,829 --> 00:53:03,750
affirmative Troy Jake and Heidi will be

971
00:53:01,049 --> 00:53:05,759
arguing against this our final topic for

972
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:09,260
the day cyber security not very

973
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:09,260
important take it away Justin

976
00:53:58,950 --> 00:54:04,930
okay nice sinister ending from Justin

977
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:06,280
Troy you're gonna lead off the

978
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:09,609
opposition to the topic of cybersecurity

979
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:12,970
not very important well it is that's why

980
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:14,980
you're all here this seems like the easy

981
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:16,330
side of the eggman to be on in a bunch

982
00:54:14,980 --> 00:54:18,460
II you got here because you went online

983
00:54:16,330 --> 00:54:19,480
to book tickets and you kind of hope

984
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:21,220
that you could book tickets where the

985
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,660
cards being sold and then you got on the

986
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:24,009
plane and you came here and it's like ah

987
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:25,629
to be really nice not to crash on the

988
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:27,190
way here and then you got in the car

989
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:28,960
that had cyber things and it'd be nice

990
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:30,580
if the brakes worked and no one else was

991
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,230
only my car or anything like that and

992
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:33,759
then you hear any check into your room

993
00:54:32,230 --> 00:54:34,930
with the electronic card and you're kind

994
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,250
of hoping that other people don't get

995
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:37,690
into your room as well and you come

996
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:38,890
downstairs with your phones and you take

997
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:40,930
your photos and you hope that other

998
00:54:38,890 --> 00:54:42,790
people aren't in that and then you're

999
00:54:40,930 --> 00:54:44,589
going to vote on our side of course just

1000
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:46,180
after this and you're hoping that all

1001
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:47,590
that works and someone hasn't gotten

1002
00:54:46,180 --> 00:54:49,629
into there and oh in that system and

1003
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:51,250
even the lights and the microphones and

1004
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:53,140
the screens and things here all

1005
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:55,270
dependent on this stuff actually working

1006
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:56,830
it is important that's why we just spent

1007
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:58,360
two days of your lives away from your

1008
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:04,299

1010
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:08,160
firm the topic that cybersecurity is not

1011
00:55:06,370 --> 00:55:14,080
very important what he thoughts Brian

1012
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:16,839
cybersecurity is a crock of shit the

1013
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:20,110
biggest fraud perpetrated on the human

1014

world let me take you back in a little

1015
00:55:20,110 --> 00:55:26,290
bit in history ladies and gentlemen

1016
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:28,750
panel members y2k no matter how many

1017
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:32,910
billions were spent on the millennium

1018
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:35,740
bug that didn't exist it set the seed

1019
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:37,930
cybersecurity is a conspiracy by the

1020
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:41,049
vendors to extract money instill

1021
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:42,700
paranoia and leech the lifeblood out of

1022
00:55:41,050 --> 00:55:46,480
the human race in the economy of this

1023

exist

Heidi Wendell what are your thoughts

1047
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:53,420
okay so cybersecurity is obviously very

1048
00:58:48,590 --> 00:58:56,780
important but it's such a new area that

1049
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:59,210
we can't even decide how it's spelt so I

1050
00:58:56,780 --> 00:59:01,100
want some audience participation here is

1051
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:05,120
cybersecurity one word or two words

1052
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:07,610
raise your hand if it's one word all

1053
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:10,910
right and ready hands if it's two words

1054
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:12,850
alright cool so I've got a bit of a

1055
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:19,640
problem

1056
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:21,589
he'll anyhow so it's that of oh it's

1057
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:23,089
that in its early ages in the moment

1058
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:25,310
that we've not even sure as to how it's

1059
00:59:23,090 --> 00:59:28,040
actually spelt correctly and we've got a

1060
00:59:25,310 --> 00:59:29,180
lot of options moving forward as to how

1061
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:31,430
we want to actually shape this

1062
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:32,359
particular industry whether or not you

1063
00:59:31,430 --> 00:59:35,240
actually want to go back to the

1064
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:38,060
traditional cyber can we not that was

1065
00:59:35,240 --> 00:59:39,200
really bad whether or not we want to

1066
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:40,549
actually move forward and make this

1067
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,410
industry the best place that it can

1068
00:59:40,550 --> 00:59:44,120
actually be because we're all here today

1069
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:46,270
for a reason and it's because we

1070
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:49,210
actually believe in cybersecurity

1071
00:59:46,270 --> 00:59:52,070
