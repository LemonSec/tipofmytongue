so it's my great pleasure to introduce

2
00:00:02,419 --> 00:00:10,860
Rick McElroy from carbon black Rick is

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,928
the head of security strategy Rick is

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:14,910

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:16,560
experience educating and advising

6
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,020
organizations on reducing their risk

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,180
posture and tackling tough security

8
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,039
challenges he's held a number of

9
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,470
security positions including the US

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,580
Department of Defense and across

11
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:31,529
industry in retail insurance

12
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:32,570
entertainment cloud computing and higher

13
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:35,489
education

14
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,230
Rick's experience ranges from performing

15
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:40,169
penetration testing to building and

16
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,089
leading security programs as a US Marine

17
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:44,430
Rick worked including physical security

18
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,989
and counterterrorism services his

19
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,629
current role takes him all over the

20
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:50,430
world working with organizations on how

21
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:52,468
to develop their security strategies is

22
00:00:50,430 --> 00:00:56,690
and howling on about security and

23
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:58,920
privacy over to you we appreciate you

24
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,780
alright thanks everybody

25
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,600
first thing I'll say is thank you for

26
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:06,360
taking the time out I know exactly how

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,670
busy all of us are and so I'm always

28
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:10,290
humbled when people show up to hear me

29
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,540
talk so thanks everybody for being in

30
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:13,950
the room and hopefully I'll provide a

31
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,590
bunch of stuff today that will be

32
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,750
educational informal hopefully a little

33
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,000
entertaining and get you to rethink your

34
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,409
security strategies that's what I'm

35
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,450
really hoping to drive as an outcome

36
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,490
right so we're gonna talk about the

37
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:28,560
modern threats Cape we're gonna go into

38
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,990
the defenders advantage right frankly

39
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,659
speaking I'm tired of hearing that the

40
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:35,009
adversary has all the advantages because

41
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,280
that is not true and we're going to talk

42
00:01:35,009 --> 00:01:39,780
about two specific ones today then we're

43
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,670
going to talk about how we use those to

44
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:45,000
tip the scales back in our favor so that

45
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:47,549
sound good to everybody awesome so I

46
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,369
used to present this slide and it was

47
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:52,259
very distinct vertical categories it

48
00:01:50,369 --> 00:01:54,570
started on the left with hacktivism and

49
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,030
then on the right with nation-state

50
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,039
actors well guess what it's all kind of

51
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:01,500
blending right I mean you have wanna cry

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,329
that's using our nation-state tools that

53
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,509
were leaked eternal blue eternal Reds

54
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:08,459
running around on Linux boxes right now

55
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:09,989
you have a bunch of new countries in the

56
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,879
mix right it's like a bunch of toddlers

57
00:02:09,989 --> 00:02:13,250
with shotguns that are just spraying out

58
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:15,840
new code

59
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:18,299
we're getting really close to human

60
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,450
lives being affected 911 emergency

61
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:22,530
systems are being shut down you know

62
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:25,349
there was an incident in Saudi Arabia

63
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:27,390
recently and if you read about it there

64
00:02:25,349 --> 00:02:28,048
was three bad lines of code in this

65
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,638
attack

66
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:31,230
had the attackers got in those three

67
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:33,599
right the whole place would have

68
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:35,790
exploded I don't say that to scare

69
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,439
anybody I don't say that to drive

70
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:39,750
uncertainty or doubt those are just the

71
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:41,700
realities of where we're at right so we

72
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,079
just we see this cyber warfare whether

73
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,418
that's espionage and intelligence

74
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:47,609
gathering whether somebody doesn't like

75
00:02:45,419 --> 00:02:50,280
your country and wants to do some sort

76
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:53,849
of activity to protest against it all of

77
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,069
this stuff right we as defenders have to

78
00:02:53,849 --> 00:02:57,750
deal with when I was building my

79
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:58,980
programs you know a lot of my programs I

80
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,419
never worried about nation-state actors

81
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:02,459
frankly speaking they didn't fit my

82
00:03:00,419 --> 00:03:04,349
threat profile but now I have to worry

83
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:06,719
about techniques tactics and procedures

84
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:08,518
that adversaries and nation-states are

85
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:10,829
building and spending millions of

86
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:14,370
dollars on winding up in commodity

87
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:20,699
malware that's a problem the other the

88
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:22,769
other issues we have is that uh my

89
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:24,209
slides decided that just to go right so

90
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:26,879
we have this constantly evolving

91
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:28,709
environment right I'm sure we've all

92
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,090
felt this in our programs lawyers are

93
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:32,519
involved in telling us what what

94
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,079
technologies deploy cyber insurers our

95
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:35,729
cost to gloat or telling people what to

96
00:03:34,079 --> 00:03:37,979
put in so now a bunch of people that

97
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:40,590
don't actually know security tell us how

98
00:03:37,979 --> 00:03:43,439
to do our jobs right we have new

99
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,479
policies we have new regs all the time

100
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:47,578
in each state and in America is putting

101
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:49,139
one out so we have to deal with all of

102
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:51,509
that in the States you guys have new

103
00:03:49,139 --> 00:03:53,729
privacy laws you guys have new security

104
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:55,589
things like a SD a central 8 we spent a

105
00:03:53,729 --> 00:03:56,759
lot of time at FST gov talking about

106
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:58,470
that yesterday right

107
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:01,319
so these mandates are starting to come

108
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,669
out to help better protect systems but

109
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,899
they're not giving us the bodies to

110
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:06,349
actually come in and implement those

111
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:08,430
things and do them well

112
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:09,810
the other problem we have is time is

113
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:11,340
definitely not on our side does anybody

114
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:14,849
have all the assets they need to do

115
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,079
security in the room they never gave me

116
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:18,810
enough money that never gave me enough

117
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,329
people and certainly it's time right I

118
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:23,940
mean look we're just humans I like my

119
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:26,010
family I like being home I don't like

120
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,730
coming in at 3 a.m. to troubleshoot some

121
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,740
unknown bad

122
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:29,880
that's the current but guess what we met

123
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,730
with all of our Incident Response

124
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,020
partners two days ago and every single

125
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,730
one of them said the same thing when

126
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,890
they present it back to us and then this

127
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:40,320
happened on Christmas and then it was

128
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:42,150
Friday at 5:00 p.m. why because the

129
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,800
attackers know we're all going home and

130
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:45,780
then that's when they're gonna be there

131
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,970
farías stuff but guess what we don't get

132
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:51,119
Christmases we don't get long holidays

133
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,860
and all of that stress all of that we

134
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,660
have to be right all of the time right

135
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,430
it's causing a bunch of us to quit the

136
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,040
industry there's a recent survey that

137
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,420
said 38 percent of all information

138
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,510
security professionals are just walking

139
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:05,880
away that's a crazy number because we

140
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,740
have anywhere from 700,000 to 2.5

141
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:11,070
million jobs depending on the report

142
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:13,530
that you read open in the world so how

143
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,969
do we close that gap with 38% of us

144
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:16,380
walking out the door we got to do a

145
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:18,840
little better as a community right we

146
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,140
got to help each other we need effective

147
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,489
strategies that give us our time back

148
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:26,070
the other issue we're dealing with and

149
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:28,050
you know this is a fairly small vendor

150
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:30,570
floor but I do all of these events if

151
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:32,970
you go to RSA you know there's thousands

152
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:34,469
of vendors in this space so as a

153
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:36,420
professional how do you pick one of

154
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,580
these pieces of technology how do you

155
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,750
have vet it how do you test it how do

156
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,070
you know it's actually driving the

157
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,560
outcome it's supposed to drive for you

158
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:46,409
right well guess what that lands back on

159
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,880
us too we have to have the ability to

160
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:49,560
test these things we have to have the

161
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,150
ability to implement them we certainly

162
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:54,290
have to convince people to go for kirim

163
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:57,239
because these things aren't cheap right

164
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:59,820
so we've spent a whole lot of time as an

165
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,470
industry buying a bunch of stuff and

166
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:04,230
I'll make the argument it hasn't really

167
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:06,690
mattered right last year most number of

168
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:10,200
Records leaked most number of Records

169
00:06:06,690 --> 00:06:11,400
hacked the year before same same same so

170
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:16,440
it's all of this actually making a

171
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:17,909
difference I don't know but let's talk

172
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:21,180
about the things we can control

173
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:24,810
right our biggest advantages defenders

174
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:26,250
is it's our home field the bad guys have

175
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:27,270
to recon us all the time when they land

176
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:28,890
in your systems they don't know where

177
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:31,229
they are they just know they popped a

178
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:33,890
Windows box so they start recon them

179
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:36,450
they're gathering asset information

180
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:39,419
what's on this box what processes are

181
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:40,590
running how can I laterally move is that

182
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:42,900
a database

183
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:44,820
what's in that database can I sell that

184
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,109
on the dark web can i monetize it and oh

185
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:48,750
by the way at the end of their chains

186
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:50,100
what they're doing regardless of their

187
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,590
goal and effort when they get in is

188
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:55,380
they're dropping ransomware their crypto

189
00:06:52,590 --> 00:06:57,330
jackin and there's a huge rise across

190
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,680
the world and destructive attacks so

191
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,969
when you back an attacker in the corner

192
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,680
what are they going to do they start

193
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:03,480
burning your infrastructure there's a

194
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,780
recent attack in America where the

195
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:07,470
attackers went after the backups first I

196
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:09,090
was the first thing they did they

197
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:10,950
deleted all the backups and then ransom

198
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,479
all the systems that sucks

199
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:15,390
like frankly speaking if I was running

200
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,830
that program I don't know how I'd hang

201
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:18,510
my head for a long time I mean that's

202
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:22,050
just that's a crappy place to be and so

203
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:24,030
what we have to do is get our assets in

204
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:26,460
order we have to know what's on our home

205
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:29,070
field right we have to turn our lights

206
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,659
on you know there's this idea in law

207
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:32,849
enforcement right called collective

208
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,770
defense it works pretty much like this

209
00:07:32,850 --> 00:07:36,120
you look at you look at the the

210
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:37,409
statistical information you say there's

211
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,330
a lot of muggings in my neighborhood

212
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:42,180
right like people that people are

213
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:43,440
getting mugged so so the neighborhood

214
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,670
gets together they work with law

215
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,130
enforcement and they all trim their

216
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:49,640
hedges together right they put in more

217
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:51,810
streetlights to provide visibility

218
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,729
collectively as a group we can start to

219
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:56,100
do that as defenders as well we need to

220
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,360
start trimming our hedges together we

221
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:59,100
need to get our assets in order we need

222
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,720
to understand our baselines so that we

223
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,030
can understand what abnormal is when it

224
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,980
occurs right I can tell you when you're

225
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,419
off threat hunting doing incident

226
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,450
response processes or any of these

227
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:10,740
things at the tail end of the breaches

228
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:12,840
you're waiting around a lot to figure

229
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:15,870
out what happens and in a lot of cases

230
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,669
we're wasting a lot of time chasing down

231
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,070
good known applications that do things

232
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:21,750
like the bad actors do right I mean if

233
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,969
you've ever had to go into an

234
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,470
environment with WMI and SCCM and sort

235
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:27,800
out whether that's a bad actor or

236
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:29,820
Microsoft doing what it's supposed to do

237
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,080
you're gonna waste a lot of time and

238
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,970
inevitably you come up with false

239
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,559
positives right you don't even find the

240
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:38,970
bad actor we got to cut all that time

241
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:41,219
down you know where I live and I'm I did

242
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:42,600
some research before I came over you

243
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:44,160
guys have a very similar climate to

244
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:46,170
Southern California right we have

245
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,030
wildfires that are going crazy I think

246
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:49,319
my County is probably already preparing

247
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,870
for the next wave because it's been real

248
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,450
rainy this year but what are we able to

249
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:55,460
do we're able to use data and

250
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,960
Linux we're able to look at fire

251
00:08:55,460 --> 00:09:00,470
conditions they're starting to put in

252
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:03,110
sensors we we move and pre position air

253
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:04,700
assets and firefighters so San Diego

254
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:07,640
firefighters will go up to San Francisco

255
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:09,250
and fight fires right same thing for LA

256
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:12,920
County same thing for San Diego County

257
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:14,570
we pre position those air assets knowing

258
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,420
that at some point that fire is gonna

259
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:19,520
break out right I think it's defenders

260
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:21,199
we need to do a little more that we need

261
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:25,130
to figure out that at some point a

262
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:27,140
breach will happen I don't care how much

263
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,460
of the stuff you stop if it's a term

264
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:29,630
enough adversary they're gonna get in

265
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,730
and I'm gonna talk a little bit about of

266
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:33,170
the adversaries work in a minute and

267
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:35,930
hopefully that gives you a better

268
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:37,280
understanding of why at some point the

269
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,750
defenses are going to break down we're

270
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,199
humans right there's a lot of us

271
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,120
involved

272
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,290
someone's gonna click on a thing you're

273
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,990
not gonna have time to tune the system

274
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:46,670
oh I missed an alert because it was

275
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:49,490
stuck in the middle of thousands of them

276
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,120
in the case of target right that's what

277
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,680
happened to them

278
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,720
target was actually alerted on that

279
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,300
breach but when they went and reviewed

280
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,820
their logs it was like the 3,000 alert

281
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,949
in that log so we have all of these

282
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:03,590
systems telling us things that are just

283
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:05,390
false positives and then we get alert

284
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:07,760
fatigue and miss miss the one that's

285
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:11,990
supposed to happen we got to flip that a

286
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:13,520
little bit so what I like to talk about

287
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,110
is preventing what you can there are

288
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,760
things that you can prevent right we've

289
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,080
done a pretty good job with D doses

290
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,460
even though they're starting to have a

291
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:22,490
comeback right I mean that was a major

292
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:25,400
thing in the early 90s now you know you

293
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:29,090
hear about them once a year right we

294
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:31,850
need to think more like the Spartans so

295
00:10:29,090 --> 00:10:34,010
I'm a huge fan of the movie 300 and the

296
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:34,970
graphic novel I'm a big geek but one of

297
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:37,910
the things I think about what the

298
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:40,520
Spartans write is they chose where they

299
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:42,680
were gonna fight right they knew their

300
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:45,140
terrain also if you look at how they

301
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,599
armed themselves they didn't walk around

302
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:50,180
in plate mail right they had giant

303
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:53,390
shields and how much to protect the most

304
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:54,620
important things right you get you get

305
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,640
hit with a sword in the chest

306
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,610
you're probably gonna fall on the

307
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:00,250
battlefield right oh and by the way they

308
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,520
came up with a thing called the Phalanx

309
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,620
right

310
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:05,360
looks like a giant turtle shell when

311
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,579
they fought their Spears were

312
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,620
designs to reach out over that

313
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:11,870
shield-wall right

314
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:14,600
so they started linking defense and

315
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:16,040
offense together they understand the

316
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,170
technics the techniques and the

317
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:20,209
procedures that their adversaries would

318
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:22,339
use against them they forced them into a

319
00:11:20,209 --> 00:11:25,760
bottleneck and they defended what they

320
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:27,800
need to and the story the 300 still

321
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:30,230
resonates throughout history we're still

322
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:33,229
talking about Leonidas and those guys so

323
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:34,610
pick your areas to defend you're

324
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,990
probably not gonna get enough money to

325
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:38,450
defend all of them so you're gonna have

326
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:40,040
to make some trade-offs in some cases

327
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:41,899
you're gonna have high-value assets and

328
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,640
you're gonna decide we need to figure

329
00:11:41,899 --> 00:11:47,920
out how to make shields for those

330
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:50,510
high-value assets in other areas maybe

331
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,750
you just rely on good detection and

332
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:55,250
response right shops all over the world

333
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:59,120
from the largest shops so the smaller

334
00:11:55,250 --> 00:12:01,579
shops are choosing right a better

335
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:03,769
detection model a better way to respond

336
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:05,300
that's faster to root cause to actually

337
00:12:03,769 --> 00:12:06,890
see the adversaries when they're doing

338
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,990
what they're doing and move to disrupt

339
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:13,519
that activity in real time these are

340
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:16,190
humans on on humans battling detect and

341
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,899
respond where you can't right I fly all

342
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:20,390
over the world when I give this talk in

343
00:12:17,899 --> 00:12:23,839
the UK it's very easy they have more

344
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:25,459
CCTV cameras than anywhere right but

345
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,380
what I'm keenly interested especially in

346
00:12:25,459 --> 00:12:29,390
that market and I was very blessed to

347
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:32,750
travel with the former head of

348
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:35,089
counterterrorism for the UK and he said

349
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:36,890
hey when we have an attack it's very

350
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:39,949
visible right same thing in cyber the

351
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:42,769
westminster attack right people are like

352
00:12:39,949 --> 00:12:44,240
oh that was bad you had a you had

353
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:45,740
someone with a car start running people

354
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,529
over but do you know what the the law

355
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:52,269
enforcement response time was on that

356
00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:55,730
sub 60 seconds that's pretty outstanding

357
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:58,190
they've chosen to take a stance that you

358
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:59,990
can't prevent all of these attacks you

359
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:02,990
can deter some things you can build

360
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:05,810
concrete structures at the sidewalks and

361
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:08,060
around your key locations but what

362
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:10,369
they're really good at is seeing what

363
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,959
happens and responded rapidly and I

364
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:13,250
think that's a better model if they

365
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:15,290
chose to spend all of their money on

366
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:17,610
prevention it's probably not going to

367
00:13:15,290 --> 00:13:20,020
work out in the end right

368
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:22,000
so here's why right when the attackers

369
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:25,360
get inside your environment they are

370
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,920
going to look exactly like you the first

371
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,930
thing they're gonna do when they land on

372
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,329
the box is start popping your

373
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:34,120
credentials so whether that's you know

374
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:36,880
using Mimi Katz to reach into memory and

375
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,700
grab those you know system admin creds

376
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,350
and start moving around that's what

377
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:43,780
they're gonna do right so it's very hard

378
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:47,110
to detect like is that normal sysadmin

379
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:49,300
behavior or is it an adversary we have

380
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:51,040
to have the visibility to see that we

381
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:53,290
have to be able to determine what's the

382
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,980
noise and what isn't and they camouflage

383
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:59,050
themselves very very well but we got to

384
00:13:56,980 --> 00:14:01,240
be able to tell in the end like which

385
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:05,920
one's the adversary and which one's just

386
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:07,150
background noise let's talk about kill

387
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:11,530
change is everybody familiar with the

388
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:14,500
term kill train yes that's awesome so

389
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:17,829
the first name kill chain was Lockheed

390
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:19,320
Martin in 2011 right I think Lockheed

391
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:23,980
did an excellent job

392
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:26,140
publicizing how attacks work right I

393
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:28,120
think one of the issues with it is they

394
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,470
still treat it as a linear process and

395
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,240
I'm gonna talk to you a little bit about

396
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,640
why attackers don't work in a linear

397
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,080
fashion but it was pretty good and we

398
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:37,510
all built upon it and it was great right

399
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:39,100
well boom I'm a bigger fan of miter

400
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:42,100
attack is everybody familiar with minor

401
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:44,290
attack that came out last year so miter

402
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:48,460
for the first time ever it gave us the

403
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:50,020
Bible of TTP's right the techniques the

404
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:52,870
tactics and the procedures that the

405
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:54,520
adversaries use against us so things

406
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:56,320
like credential harvesting how do they

407
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:58,270
do that how do I do that on a Windows

408
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,740
box how do I do that on the Mac they

409
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:01,810
give you a set they give you a list of

410
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:04,420
these techniques right and oh by the way

411
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:06,250
it's rare that a new technique shows up

412
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,959
it's about every 18 months that you'll

413
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,490
see a new technique so once you can

414
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,110
start to look for these techniques once

415
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:13,090
you can start to describe them you can

416
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:16,240
start to build your technology to detect

417
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:18,310
and prevent those and I would argue that

418
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,960
mitre attack has moved the needle for

419
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:21,520
defenders greatly I mean if anybody

420
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,650
wants to go look at the mitre attack

421
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:25,060
testing reports it's amazing how many

422
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:27,579
vendors had to change their gear as a

423
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:28,959
result of that right I can tell you and

424
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:31,030
I'm uh

425
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:32,590
do work for the vendor we didn't have to

426
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,329
change anything our fundamental

427
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:36,670
technology operates on the premise of

428
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:39,790
recording all of the things and not

429
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:42,189
determining what's bad or good right

430
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:43,839
because the bad guys know how our

431
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:45,670
technology works they know how all the

432
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,770
defensive technology works you know if

433
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:49,329
you if you go look at the vault seven

434
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:51,880
and vol 8 releases those were from the

435
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:53,710
Central Intelligence Agency's you can

436
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:56,020
look up two things marble and

437
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:57,940
grasshopper you can start to see how

438
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:59,500
they were doing implants on Mac boxes

439
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,570
you can start to see how they were

440
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,010
invading things like semantics so foes

441
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:05,470
trend all of these traditional

442
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:07,150
technologies and oh by the way that was

443
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:08,500
leaked as well and then those techniques

444
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:10,800
were seen in the wild shortly thereafter

445
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:13,510
right so the bad guys actually by

446
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,010
defensive technologies deploy it to

447
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:16,660
figure out how to work around it and

448
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:20,860
they're very iterative in that process

449
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:23,020
during the attachment we talked about

450
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:25,180
cognitions of an attacker right so how

451
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:26,770
do they think how do they work we know a

452
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:28,989
lot of this because our background from

453
00:16:26,770 --> 00:16:30,250
the company is offensive hackers that

454
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:32,710
came out of the US government that were

455
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,330
trained to do this professionally we

456
00:16:32,710 --> 00:16:36,790
understand how they work and they

457
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:39,550
generally work like this they're gonna

458
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:40,959
do some sort of recon once they do the

459
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:43,120
Recon they're gonna infiltrate into your

460
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,680
systems once they infiltrate they're

461
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,450
gonna start to do all kinds of things

462
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,270
but most people think of this as a

463
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:52,390
linear progression like I have to do

464
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:53,949
recon to get to manipulation and then I

465
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:56,860
got to do manipulation to get to exfil

466
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:59,910
it's not actually true it's everybody

467
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:03,340
familiar with Udo loops observe orient

468
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:06,670
detect and act so it actually came out

469
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:09,160
of World War two right when we started

470
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:11,380
dogfighting the pilots that could make

471
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,540
decisions faster and that particular

472
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:15,310
loop we're better able to take down

473
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:17,349
their adversary right it's been adopted

474
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:20,349
for cyber security but the OODA loops

475
00:17:17,349 --> 00:17:21,639
work more like this inside of each one

476
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:22,780
of those phases they're gonna change

477
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,330
what they do depending on what the

478
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,950
previous phase was if you treat these

479
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:29,230
things as a point in time decision like

480
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:30,040
a lot of the technologies do you're

481
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,510
gonna miss it

482
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,460
you got to chain all of those events

483
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:35,740
together they see them over time because

484
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:38,230
they can skip steps they can go back to

485
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:41,650
step one they can iterate through three

486
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:42,130
so we look at it more of a lifecycle of

487
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:44,679
the attack

488
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:47,200
we think of it more as a prevention loop

489
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:50,590
not a one-time prevention a detection

490
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,299
loop a response loops there's inputs

491
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:54,280
there's outputs and things you should

492
00:17:52,299 --> 00:17:56,379
change as a result of what the attackers

493
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,970
are doing if you can start to build your

494
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,929
detection strategies and prevention

495
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,850
strategies that way

496
00:17:58,929 --> 00:18:03,429
you can get a whole lot more agile in

497
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:10,209
battling and and performing Oda loops

498
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:16,570
against the adversary so when we used to

499
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:18,340
do things it was very rare that someone

500
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:20,500
would stop us from doing things but when

501
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:22,899
they did typically what occurred is this

502
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:26,679
and I'll overlay it over the miner kill

503
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:27,970
chain for now to simplify it so it

504
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:29,200
starts at the front we get initial

505
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:31,530
access we then move the execution

506
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,640
persistence all the things right

507
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:35,440
generally speaking what happens in

508
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,799
almost all the technologies in this

509
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,690
space work at the end of the chain when

510
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,600
the data is being exfilled when the

511
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:45,220
execution is occurring we believe that

512
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,530
if you drive that visibility up that

513
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:49,390
kill chain what you can actually do is

514
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:51,190
start to make the attackers work harder

515
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:53,860
their job is way too easy they are not

516
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:55,150
writing new code NSA says they haven't

517
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:58,090
seen a zero-day in twenty eight months

518
00:18:55,150 --> 00:19:00,700
you know why everybody familiar with

519
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:02,230
Imhotep this piece it's a number one

520
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:03,880
piece of malware in the world it

521
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,980
actually came out in 2012 as a banking

522
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:08,169
Trojan now it's pretty cool it's like

523
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:09,760
the Swiss Army knife of apt actors so

524
00:19:08,169 --> 00:19:11,650
Imhotep is still running around the

525
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:14,620
world and we haven't stopped it it's a

526
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:16,120
little crazy to me right once you can

527
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,639
start to drive this up the chain what

528
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:21,280
you can actually start to do is stack

529
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,570
detectors and prevention together right

530
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,139
to provide that better chance of

531
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:28,389
stopping the attackers because look

532
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:30,580
during the Recon phase and initial

533
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:32,890
access sure it's a compromise but it's

534
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:34,240
not horrible you're not gonna have to go

535
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:36,039
on the headlines or disclose a breach

536
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,650
but once it gets to the end of that

537
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:40,330
chain that's where it's really bad right

538
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:42,970
that's where sis o--'s are getting shot

539
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:44,289
in the leg they didn't know about I'm

540
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:47,309
glad everybody saw the keynote this

541
00:19:44,289 --> 00:19:50,830
morning so look when we talk about

542
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:52,540
disruption and depth with Windows does

543
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:53,918
anybody know how many techniques are

544
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:55,678
associated with lateral movements on a

545
00:19:53,919 --> 00:20:00,970
Windows box

546
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:03,669
it's 37 it's only 37 things it's not

547
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:05,080
infinity things write on a Windows box

548
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:08,739
there's only so many things you can do

549
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:12,728
to credential harvest PW dump me me cats

550
00:20:08,739 --> 00:20:14,710
are the most prevalent so once you can

551
00:20:12,729 --> 00:20:15,909
start to overlay and again if you want

552
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:16,899
to go check out minor tack it's pretty

553
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:18,700
awesome but once you can start to

554
00:20:16,899 --> 00:20:19,959
overlay that over the portions of the

555
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,820
kill chain what you can actually start

556
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:24,039
to do is stack this stuff together so in

557
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:25,629
this particular instance what is

558
00:20:24,039 --> 00:20:26,830
ransomware actually look like from a

559
00:20:25,629 --> 00:20:30,369
techniques tactics and procedures

560
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:31,869
perspective looks a bit like this you're

561
00:20:30,369 --> 00:20:33,820
gonna get a spearfishing attachment

562
00:20:31,869 --> 00:20:36,220
there will be a link link to the

563
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:38,109
spearfishing hey someone's gonna touch

564
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:39,190
volume Shadow Copy on that end point

565
00:20:38,109 --> 00:20:41,559
that happens with every piece of

566
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:42,879
ransomware that's out there oh and oh by

567
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:44,590
the way ransomware is gonna start to

568
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:46,748
grab credentials so it can lateral move

569
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:49,599
it'll do something like pass the hash or

570
00:20:46,749 --> 00:20:51,549
pass the ticket meaning I grab your hash

571
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:52,960
password out of memory and then now I'm

572
00:20:51,549 --> 00:20:56,679
passing that around the network to other

573
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:59,019
boxes if you if you loo have system

574
00:20:56,679 --> 00:21:00,190
administrators but have local admins on

575
00:20:59,019 --> 00:21:02,559
your boxes I would just tell you you

576
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:03,789
gotta get like do that right now if you

577
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,399
have one effort when you go back either

578
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:09,099
MFA or or start getting rid of your

579
00:21:06,399 --> 00:21:14,799
admin accounts locally to systems and

580
00:21:09,099 --> 00:21:17,200
you'll be in much better shape so they

581
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,979
often say this we have to be right 100%

582
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,419
of the time

583
00:21:17,979 --> 00:21:21,580
right the attackers only have to be

584
00:21:19,419 --> 00:21:23,169
right once I hate that because it's

585
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:25,509
actually not true we get multiple

586
00:21:23,169 --> 00:21:27,759
at-bats there are a chain of events that

587
00:21:25,509 --> 00:21:30,070
occur over a breach in this particular

588
00:21:27,759 --> 00:21:31,809
case and this comes from our good good

589
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:34,330
partner red canary so if anybody's

590
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:36,158
interested in learning more about this

591
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:39,849
stuff their blog is amazing right I love

592
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:42,009
the canary guys but look out look up and

593
00:21:39,849 --> 00:21:44,019
word no big deal how many times does

594
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:45,789
that happen in a day probably across the

595
00:21:44,019 --> 00:21:47,950
globe millions of times I mean users are

596
00:21:45,789 --> 00:21:51,609
always open and Word docs right but then

597
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:52,289
word spawns a command shell well that's

598
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:54,549
weird

599
00:21:52,289 --> 00:21:56,529
why would word ever spawn spawn a

600
00:21:54,549 --> 00:21:59,918
command shell and then that command

601
00:21:56,529 --> 00:22:03,789
shell calls PS exec power shell is

602
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:05,559
everybody familiar with power shell it's

603
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:08,640
oh by the way on every Windows box and

604
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:09,899
then Windows just added a new shell

605
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,090
and they're bringing PowerShell to Linux

606
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,320
like that's a thing now so now we have

607
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:15,600
all these shells for attackers to

608
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:18,360
interact with PowerShell happens to be

609
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:20,490
the most prevalent but if you wanted to

610
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:24,899
take a look into your air into your

611
00:22:20,490 --> 00:22:26,940
organization's from a system privilege

612
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:29,010
misuse perspective go look at PowerShell

613
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:31,110
go look at WMI so the number one thing

614
00:22:29,010 --> 00:22:32,280
that attackers are doing but look when

615
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,320
we can stack this stuff together we

616
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,480
actually get four shots of stopping this

617
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,480
not one so it's one attack we get four

618
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:42,990
shots they get one shot and I hate I

619
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:45,630
hate that we're not having a bigger

620
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:47,100
impact on them right so I know I've

621
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:49,620
covered a whole lot I know I've talked

622
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:53,310
about a lot of things mitre attack TTP's

623
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:55,020
all of these things look we have to

624
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:58,889
simplify we have to go back to what

625
00:22:55,020 --> 00:23:01,500
works what works is visibility response

626
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:03,120
and oh by the way that visibility is

627
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:06,780
also going to make better prevention

628
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:08,239
decisions upstream as an example a user

629
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:11,540
clicked on a link

630
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,950
was it because Adobe wasn't patched

631
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:15,720
right did my content filter and let me

632
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:18,060
down on that did my spam filter let me

633
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:19,470
down you can actually get into iterative

634
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:21,690
tuning loops on all of the other

635
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:23,040
technology that you have every attack

636
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:24,720
should make us better collectively as a

637
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,280
group we should learn from all of those

638
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,230
attacks and we should make changes as a

639
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:31,260
result we're not fast enough and making

640
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:34,230
those projecting production changes and

641
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:37,350
this speed is how we're eventually gonna

642
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:39,240
catch up to the attackers because look

643
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:40,590
in the end when they're inside your

644
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:44,160
environment you only have to be one step

645
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:45,840
faster right and they do make mistakes

646
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:48,300
all the time they make mistakes and

647
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:50,939
codes they're noisy sometimes not

648
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:53,070
everybody is a ninja not everybody is a

649
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:54,150
nation-state actor right there's a whole

650
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:55,740
lot of script kiddies still out there

651
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:58,620
that are just grabbing things from

652
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:59,490
github plugging them together so

653
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,159
remember you don't have to be one step

654
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:04,020
faster right

655
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:06,900
but it's really about this they only

656
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:08,840
have to be successful once that's a

657
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:11,070
horrible premise like as an industry

658
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:12,689
right like think about the pressure and

659
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:14,159
stress that comes with security leaders

660
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:15,660
and people that care about their

661
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,360
security programs where it's like we

662
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:20,040
missed one thing like we did a great job

663
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,270
for 20 years and this one thing and we

664
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,870
got walked out the Builder and fired

665
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:25,150
right and

666
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:27,059
a hard time getting the next job I say

667
00:24:25,150 --> 00:24:29,710
we need to flip this when they are in

668
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:32,559
side my environment when they're on my

669
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:35,290
field I'm gonna demand that there they

670
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:36,490
have to be a hundred percent right and I

671
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:38,800
can guarantee you the number of people

672
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:40,809
in the world that would that could be a

673
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:43,540
hundred percent right is very small very

674
00:24:40,809 --> 00:24:44,830
very small you know the the the groups

675
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,909
that are out there publishing these new

676
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:47,889
techniques I mean they're spending

677
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:51,370
millions of dollars and they have entire

678
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:53,910
wings behind them right when they're

679
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:56,770
inside your house turn the lights on

680
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:57,940
right if an attacker comes into your

681
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,270
home what's the first thing you do at

682
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,380
night

683
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:02,139
you're probably gonna turn your lights

684
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:03,760
on and get some visibility then you're

685
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:05,380
probably gonna move to respond right

686
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,700
maybe that's you get out of bed maybe

687
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,760
that you pick up the phone and call

688
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,960
emergency services in the police right

689
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,790
it's the same thing we should be doing

690
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,650
with our systems when they're inside we

691
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:16,450
should know about it and we should move

692
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:18,690
to disrupt them as fast as possible and

693
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:22,300
here's what happens from a macro level

694
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:25,600
think about that kill chain if I make an

695
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:27,760
attacker take manual steps along every

696
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,620
single one of those and have to iterate

697
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,350
his code to get to the next step

698
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:34,840
guess what happens generally speaking

699
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:36,550
unless again they're a very persistent

700
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:39,189
threat they're gonna move on to an

701
00:25:36,550 --> 00:25:40,780
easier target they just are the

702
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:43,390
attackers are concerned about their time

703
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:45,370
and their ROI as well so I like

704
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:47,830
frustrating attackers right I like to be

705
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:49,540
able to disrupt them do things like

706
00:25:47,830 --> 00:25:51,928
deception slide them out of the other

707
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:54,399
environments dictate the battlefield

708
00:25:51,929 --> 00:25:56,080
right that's one thing we're really not

709
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:01,330
good at is dictating the battlefield but

710
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:04,389
they are from a macro sense it's a one

711
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:05,500
trillion dollar economy we spend about a

712
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,040
hundred billion as security

713
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:11,350
professionals

714
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:12,850
it's like 10x right the only way we're

715
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:14,800
gonna make a dent in this is to make

716
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:17,860
their jobs harder is the waste their

717
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:20,710
time is to frustrate the attackers it's

718
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:22,949
too easy think about this there are

719
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:25,090
people paying rent to ransoming systems

720
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:27,640
like they're paying their rent doing

721
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:30,129
that they're not always a cartel they're

722
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:31,660
not always a nation-state you can go on

723
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:34,050
YouTube right now and look it up to

724
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:35,620
people in Romania with two servers

725
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,250
that's what they're doing

726
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,050
there's

727
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:39,580
our communities around the globe that

728
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:41,200
are fostering this type of activity

729
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:44,679
because no one's gonna stop them and

730
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,850
they are oh is too easy right we have

731
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:48,040
the ability to change this as a

732
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:51,040
community we can start to disrupt the

733
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:52,659
economy behind cybercrime and attacks

734
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:55,750
and if we can start to do that I think

735
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:58,690
we have an actual chance of flipping the

736
00:26:55,750 --> 00:27:00,400
scales back to the defenders so with

737
00:26:58,690 --> 00:27:09,400
that I'll take questions and thank you

738
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:13,980
very much for listening yes sir yes sir

739
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,980
in that particular attack yeah yeah oh

740
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,540
no in this particular case what they did

741
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:22,150
is provide visibility into the actual

742
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:24,040
kill chain right so one outlook spawned

743
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:25,930
word you have to be able to record that

744
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:28,810
data and look at it word then kicks off

745
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:31,150
command execution what what is that

746
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:35,050
command execution doing the visibility

747
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:37,300
of that correct correct and it's gonna

748
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:40,030
bury per attack right like it depends on

749
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:43,169
the techniques of tagging yep correct

750
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:49,270
correct yeah that makes sense Oh

751
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:53,970
questions oh man I answered everybody's

752
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:53,970
questions yes sir

753
00:27:57,390 --> 00:28:02,380
yes sir so what's Microsoft doing about

754
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:04,960
this right I think it's a fair question

755
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:08,530
they're they own a whole lot of the

756
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:11,200
attack surface I have to say I used to

757
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:13,570
bash Microsoft horribly over the head in

758
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,980
my talks I can't quite do that anymore

759
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:17,320
they've sort of made a lot of progress

760
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:19,000
so so if you look at Windows 10 as a

761
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,879
platform compared to Windows 7 and

762
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:23,950
Windows 8 the the level of effort to

763
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:26,320
actually own a thing on a Windows 10 is

764
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:28,090
much harder so there's thinning out the

765
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,320
attack service other things that they're

766
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:32,199
doing they're providing better

767
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:33,909
visibility into things like process

768
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,500
hollowing on the end point which is a

769
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:38,020
prevalent technique that the attackers

770
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:39,430
do they bought hexa di't which gives

771
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:43,389
them the ability to orchestrate some of

772
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:45,280
this stuff on a 365 they're there they

773
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:47,320
have a sim right

774
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:50,139
they've got data analytics they've got

775
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:51,669
threat Intel so I would tell you

776
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:53,860
all of the folks in the world Microsoft

777
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:55,420
probably represents the biggest ability

778
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,979
to thin them out right I mean I think I

779
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:58,680
think Mac and Apple have done a pretty

780
00:28:56,980 --> 00:29:01,240
good job with it

781
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:02,860
iPads are pretty hard to pop iPhones are

782
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,770
pretty hard to pop but a Windows box is

783
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:06,939
pretty easy so so yeah so I say give

784
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:08,170
Microsoft another two years and they

785
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:10,030
might put us out of business who knows

786
00:29:08,170 --> 00:29:12,820
maybe not because it's Microsoft right

787
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:15,040
but I like the progress yeah and they've

788
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:17,830
hired an amazing amount of good people

789
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:19,510
on the problem and they get a lot of

790
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:21,310
data right I mean they get to agar that

791
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,960
aggregate that all in the cloud and the

792
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:25,240
better data the more you can understand

793
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,460
the behaviors and then drive change on

794
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:30,930
the endpoint so yeah certainly they're

795
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:34,080
not the old Microsoft they used to be

796
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:34,080
yes sir

797
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:50,190
gotcha so so the question is what what

798
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:52,530
do you do as as compute becomes

799
00:29:50,190 --> 00:29:54,030
prevalent right and your environments

800
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:58,230
disappearing because there's no longer

801
00:29:54,030 --> 00:30:01,080
data centers we're all in the cloud yeah

802
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:04,140
so you have to provide protection where

803
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:06,000
the data lives in transit and where

804
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:07,260
people interact with it right so that's

805
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,090
why we focus on the endpoint not on

806
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:10,650
network stuff because that's where the

807
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:13,409
gate is and that's what the bad guys are

808
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:15,090
going to go so as we continue to have

809
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:17,040
mobile devices as we continue to have

810
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:19,320
laptops you know people want to work

811
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:21,000
wherever they do and and we all have

812
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,320
cloud services but you got to put that

813
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:24,300
as defenders we have to put that whole

814
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,260
picture together right so it's not to

815
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:27,149
say you're not going to need a

816
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:29,700
technology stack it's just got to be an

817
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:32,340
effective one for your particular use

818
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:34,020
case right so as you're designing your

819
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:36,330
solution you have to really think about

820
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:38,040
that mobility is an issue and having the

821
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:40,080
visibility and prevention down there to

822
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:42,420
to stop that stuff that's occurring it's

823
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,220
why the endpoint has become prevalent

824
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:45,720
over the last five years for an attack

825
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:47,070
perspective used to be networks right

826
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:49,680
everybody want to get into the network

827
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:59,460
now it's the endpoints because data

828
00:30:49,680 --> 00:31:01,440
centers are gone yeah yeah I think

829
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:08,250
that's generally good for security right

830
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:10,020
now I would tell you I would argue we're

831
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:12,810
moving as fast as we can and some of

832
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:15,330
it's not our fault yeah like if you take

833
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:17,669
an IOT as an example right when you have

834
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:20,250
competitors that are competing on cheap

835
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:22,650
fast and easy security usually takes a

836
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:24,540
backseat so if anybody works for chip

837
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:26,190
manufacturers or madam we'd love to talk

838
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:27,950
to you about partnering up and helping

839
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:30,330
the problem so some of it's like

840
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:31,950
providing the footprint on an end like a

841
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:33,419
mobile endpoint to actually do something

842
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:36,660
like streaming prevention or streaming

843
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:38,220
detection to you right so so a lot lots

844
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:40,710
of vendors in the space we're talking to

845
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:42,270
manufacturers for sure so I know that's

846
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:43,380
not a quick answer I know that's not

847
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:45,840
something you can take back to your

848
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,410
program tomorrow but it's gonna take us

849
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,050
a while as a community on that one for

850
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:52,060
sure for sure for sure yeah and even

851
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:53,980
Chromebooks right I mean Chromebooks

852
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:55,480
represent a good way for executives and

853
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:58,210
people who don't have to do a lot of

854
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:00,250
things to be protected right you could

855
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:01,990
you can look at application whitelisting

856
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:04,150
products that are out there right and go

857
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:06,820
with A+ security model only known good

858
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:09,070
runs I mean that's that's generally what

859
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:11,409
Apple's done right unless you unless you

860
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:13,689
jailbreak that device you can only get

861
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:15,340
an approved app from the store and they

862
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:16,810
do a pretty good job betting there's you

863
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:18,220
know bouncer with Google's a little

864
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:20,649
wonky sometimes you know they still

865
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:22,360
let's up to slip through but apples

866
00:32:20,650 --> 00:32:25,330
pretty good so if you have executives

867
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:26,709
tell them we use an iPad why not chances

868
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:29,679
of them getting pwned with an iPad is

869
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:30,910
pretty low and I know it concerns us

870
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:32,530
right because we can't control them in

871
00:32:30,910 --> 00:32:34,570
that stuff but if I have a concern about

872
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:42,430
one of my executives being targeted I

873
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:44,379
move over to an iPad other questions all

874
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:45,790
right with that again I will thank

875
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:48,220
everybody for their time I know exactly

876
00:32:45,790 --> 00:32:49,570
how important and how little time you

877
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:50,830
