1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,980
really exciting afternoon session for

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,199
you here ladies and gentlemen this next

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:09,210
gentleman he's going to talk on the

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,139
concept of the data breach pipeline

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,840
there are a few people better qualified

6
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:15,360
in the world to do so he knows so much

7
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,759
about the subject he's testified before

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,930
US Congress on the impact of data

9
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,050
breaches on knowledge based

10
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,250
authentication authentication um I think

11
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,050
I probably only had to watch that

12
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,759
footage of Mark Zuckerberg being grilled

13
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,529
by the US Congress to think they those

14
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,269
guys really know what they're talking

15
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,500
about that must have been a tough day at

16
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:34,469
the office for this guy who is the

17
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,519
founder of the data breach monitoring

18
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:38,520
and notification service

19
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,649
have I been paid we all know the site

20
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,780
that's the site that millions of people

21
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:43,940
have gone to when they have received

22
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,870
that email

23
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,329
suggesting they've been watched doing

24
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,160
that sort of stuff your race off to this

25
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:52,079
website and hypothetically I've been

26
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,000
told suddenly feel a lot better about

27
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,370
yourself and your ongoing employment

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,690
prospects and relationship with family

29
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:59,038
members anyway

30
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:00,780
let's give him a big round of applause

31
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,609
going to stage Troy hunts eh Evan Troy

32
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:08,760
this is all yours the data breach

33
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:10,500
pipeline seems like that was a nice

34
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:13,830
intro thank you

35
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,780
so normally I'd sort of start off by

36
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,060
saying that does anyone know this

37
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,140
website but it's probably not much point

38
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,939
now who has used this out of interest

39
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,170
Wow okay I've got stickers for all of

40
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:27,929
you to you want to come and get them

41
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:28,880
later on so this is a recap have I been

42
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,150
point is a data breach notification

43
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,860
service when we have large data breaches

44
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:37,049
Dropbox LinkedIn Ashley Madison stuff

45
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,720
like that data gets spread out all the

46
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,159
way around the world I a grenade it load

47
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,170
it into that system then you can go and

48
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:44,220
figure out where being exposed our

49
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,960
companies can go and do things like

50
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,320
domain searches figure out who in the

51
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,548
organization has say a Dropbox account

52
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,479
it's kind of interesting for a lot of

53
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:57,360
companies and the the interesting thing

54
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,060
about this service is it started off as

55
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,520
something very little back in 2013 so

56
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,829
this was like the first tweet ever and I

57
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,098
thought this would be good like a few my

58
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:09,389
mates will use it it'll be interesting

59
00:02:07,099 --> 00:02:10,950
not everyone thought it was always going

60
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:13,619
to be a good idea they thought I was

61
00:02:10,949 --> 00:02:16,920
gonna be like running as spam harvesting

62
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,349
site but the funny thing about is is

63
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,089
like Adam said it kind of took on a bit

64
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:24,179
of a life of its own and and became

65
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:27,450
something much bigger to the point where

66
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,920
it it ended me up over here and you know

67
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:31,798
like he made it sound very serious and

68
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,629
it was kind of serious I had to get

69
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:36,390
dressed up everything you see me wearing

70
00:02:33,629 --> 00:02:38,280
there I had to buy so I'm dressed up but

71
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,779
today because I live on the Gold Coast

72
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,510
but I had to put clothes shoes on and

73
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,129
things like that and I kind of didn't

74
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,929
want to make it too serious either like

75
00:02:44,129 --> 00:02:48,000
it's it's a big event but you know let's

76
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:51,810
have some fun and I thought I should get

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,310
some cool socks and I actually tweeted

78
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,900
out I said has anyone got some nice

79
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,170
socks they want to send me so so Foss

80
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,569
sent me these socks for those about the

81
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,220
code we salute you and I thought I'll

82
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:05,760
it'll be a bit of fun and it'll just you

83
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:07,739
know lighten the mood a bit and it turns

84
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,870
out that the socks were quite popular

85
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:12,870
and you can even now go and buy a stock

86
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:16,680
photo of my socks 199 dollars off

87
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:18,239
Shutterstock and that the sort of thing

88
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,859
that struck me the other day is like how

89
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,269
did this like little project somehow end

90
00:03:19,859 --> 00:03:24,540
me up in Congress with people taking

91
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:26,940
photos and selling my socks so several

92
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,560
years on the thing keeps growing growing

93
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,239
because we do have so many different

94
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,530
data breaches happening pretty much

95
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,480
every day like every day I look at my

96
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:35,549
Twitter feed as a bunch of people saying

97
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,840
hey Cece Troy hunt have you seen for

98
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:37,680
example today it's Flipboard

99
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,230
everyone's getting Flipboard

100
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,169
notifications that was canva a couple of

101
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:44,459
days ago there's always something now

102
00:03:43,169 --> 00:03:46,380
thought of interest sort of have a look

103
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:47,549
at who is behind a lot of these breaches

104
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:49,888
as well because I think there's a

105
00:03:47,549 --> 00:03:52,200
perception which is often really

106
00:03:49,889 --> 00:03:53,819
different to the reality and I'll give

107
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,328
you a good example of this so this is

108
00:03:53,819 --> 00:04:01,380
Talk Talk now Talk Talk is a massive UK

109
00:03:57,329 --> 00:04:05,250
telco and they had a breach in 2015 but

110
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:09,359
they said customs 77 million pounds like

111
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:12,150
a massive massive amount of money now at

112
00:04:09,359 --> 00:04:14,579
the time when they had the incident it

113
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:17,370
was a detective who came out and he was

114
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:20,519
quoted as saying we think it is Russian

115
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:23,099
Islamic cybg Huttese this is a true

116
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,040
statement and it like it just kind of

117
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:30,330
feels like he just picked scary words

118
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:32,190
and put them all on the page and as best

119
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:34,289
I know it is none of these things other

120
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:37,530
than maybe cyber which let's face it is

121
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:40,860
a little bit generic so it turns out it

122
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:44,039
was actually this guy and he's leaving

123
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,100
court here after having to answer for

124
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:51,270
his actions you can't see his face

125
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:53,310
because it's a 17 year old child 77

126
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:57,659
million pounds of damage 17 year old

127
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:59,340
child now he was actually 16 when he

128
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,320
broke in to talk talk

129
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,320
using sequel map freely available sequel

130
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,900
injection software did the 77 million

131
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,840
pounds with the damage the lawmakers

132
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:12,929
there took it quite seriously

133
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:14,669
they took his iPhone away which like in

134
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:17,670
fairness for 17 year old is probably

135
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:19,500
like hell right but the thing that

136
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:21,570
strikes me is how often it is like

137
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,310
children who are breaking into these

138
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:25,800
systems even great big multinationals

139
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:27,540
and that the thing about kids and

140
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:30,060
hacking these days is they have access

141
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:32,760
to so much material to be able to do

142
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:34,620
this and I want to give you an example I

143
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,430
went over to YouTube and I thought look

144
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,510
all I'll pull a video that demonstrates

145
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:42,150
hacking and there's a gazillion of them

146
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:45,240
on YouTube I thought I'll pull one which

147
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:47,479
is probably shows how simplistic the

148
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:51,030
threat actor for one of a better term is

149
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,650
have a quick listen to this guy let's do

150
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:56,130
a professional video let's actually show

151
00:05:52,650 --> 00:06:00,419
you how the concept works and I'm using

152
00:05:56,130 --> 00:06:05,280
them the SQL or school method here a

153
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:06,990
school injection it's like as me all

154
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,309
right is this and I don't know if it's a

155
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:13,140
squirrel or a chipmunk but I know it's

156
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:15,450
not a sequel so you've got kids creating

157
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,650
videos about how to break into systems

158
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:18,479
you gonna see what he does next in the

159
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:21,299
moment and they literally can't even

160
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,740
pronounce sequel so anyway he starts

161
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,210
doing this tutorial and he goes off and

162
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,730
he does his google dork and he wants to

163
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:28,200
find websites that have a query string

164
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:31,020
parameter in them that he can then take

165
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,460
and put into automated software so he

166
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,219
ends up on this site here and this is a

167
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,530
gold bullion trading site so have a look

168
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,800
at what he does once he gets over here

169
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:39,840
okay

170
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,440
with this extension what we do is put a

171
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,888
little posture fee here no comma ish put

172
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,280
it there

173
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:49,590
press ENTER and there we go so this

174
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,840
means that we have an error in the

175
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:56,068
database so there's an error in their

176
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:59,280
database so and their database is my SQL

177
00:06:56,069 --> 00:07:02,849
server there yeah so a because it to my

178
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:08,849
skill Hall my skew out we can target it

179
00:07:02,849 --> 00:07:10,500
and grab all the info now one thing to

180
00:07:08,849 --> 00:07:11,849
think about here as well is what do you

181
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,770
think it's like for kids sitting at home

182
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:15,300
watching this stuff right like they

183
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:17,250
don't have that moral compass yet of

184
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,720
what it means to do what he's beginning

185
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:20,490
to do because he's just started

186
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,380
parameter tampering he's put an

187
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:24,150
apostrophe in there somewhere some are

188
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:25,979
in the application they concatenate in

189
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:28,318
whatever that crew string value is into

190
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:30,870
a sequel query obviously not doing any

191
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,650
sanitization parameterization he's

192
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:37,050
established to proof he grabs the URL

193
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:39,419
goes and throws in a cabbage free sequel

194
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,740
injection software shows you how to pull

195
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:44,159
out all the email addresses all the

196
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:46,620
passwords and then he logs in to the

197
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:47,880
site with them now like I was watching

198
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,039
this and going that's one thing to do

199
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:54,000
this it's another thing to video

200
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:58,050
yourself doing it and put it on YouTube

201
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,310
as a tutorial for other people so once

202
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:02,370
he's authenticated he can pull out

203
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:04,529
banking data and this is a child whose

204
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:08,729
voices probably just break in can't yet

205
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:09,990
pronounce sequel it's just too easy so

206
00:08:08,729 --> 00:08:12,090
one of the things that I think the

207
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:14,819
industry's starting to focus on a little

208
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:17,369
bit more is how do we tackle this like

209
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:20,789
how do we start to think about getting

210
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:23,370
kids on the right pathway and the NCAA

211
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:24,330
in the UK is starting to focus on this

212
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:26,340
quite a bit as well

213
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:27,900
so I want to show you this a little

214
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:30,258
short clip yet I got this advertisement

215
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:32,309
of how they're trying to reach parents

216
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:35,010
it's a little bit of fun but have a

217
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:37,859
think about how representative this is

218
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:39,240
of most parents out there whose kids

219
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,890
hacking away in their bedroom and the

220
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,640
parents that have absolutely no idea

221
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:43,640
what they're doing

222
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:47,269
such a clever boy such a careful boy mr.

223
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:51,019
Queen

224
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:53,480
spends all night oh listen how smart is

225
00:08:51,019 --> 00:08:55,100
this you know them shooter games the

226
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,779
other day he was losing so he crashed

227
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:59,199
the server Papa was good

228
00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:02,290
it's amazing what kids can do these days

229
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:04,969
not only or what did they call it

230
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:07,219
ddossing that's it I saw it on the telly

231
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:10,160
he's no dasa they were only a hundred

232
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,810
percent in maths every single exam for

233
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,670
the last two years not to mention his

234
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:18,170
GCSE coursework that's gonna go a long

235
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:21,939
way valium eleven to Cambridge Computer

236
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:24,380
Sciences degree top career in computing

237
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:27,190
internet billionaire by the time he's 25

238
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:31,509
the next Steve Gates

239
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:31,509
he's very clever but there's money too

240
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:43,790
we only give him a tenner a week doubles

241
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:45,670
he robbed a bank and that the thing is

242
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:48,860
like it's very close to the truth right

243
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:51,130
most parents have got no idea about the

244
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:53,360
technology that their kids are using and

245
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:54,680
then the kids don't yet have that moral

246
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,800
compass and we end up with things like

247
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:59,388
what we saw just before now cause a lot

248
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,949
of these breaches impact passwords we

249
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:02,449
saw passwords on the previous screen he

250
00:10:00,949 --> 00:10:04,758
used them to then go and authenticate to

251
00:10:02,449 --> 00:10:07,310
the app so I thought it'd be worthwhile

252
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:08,569
just recapping on on passwords briefly

253
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,800
in terms of where we've come from and

254
00:10:08,569 --> 00:10:12,040
where we're going as well because

255
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:14,329
there's a lot that is actually changing

256
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:17,870
and on that first bit the bit where

257
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:19,130
we've come from this is MIT in the 60s

258
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:21,350
and this is believed to be the

259
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:23,569
first-ever case of having a password on

260
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:25,610
a computer system so this was a

261
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:28,579
compatible time sharing system you'd go

262
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:30,079
into this room of computer and you'd log

263
00:10:28,579 --> 00:10:31,790
in and then you would have access to

264
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,689
whatever it is you did with a computer

265
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:35,899
that filled up a room

266
00:10:32,689 --> 00:10:39,680
back in the 60s now if we think about

267
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:41,680
the threats we had then and the threat

268
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,489
actors and the access that they needed

269
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,199
first of all I had to have physical

270
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,639
access you had to be in the room this

271
00:10:45,199 --> 00:10:49,880
was not a connected system you couldn't

272
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:51,259
go home and dial in when you got in

273
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:53,959
there you need a sophisticated knowledge

274
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:55,370
I don't know what you do when you get in

275
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:56,760
it maybe take Miko's punch card from

276
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,200
this morning and put it in something

277
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,689
who knows but you've got to know what

278
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,750
you're doing which is really different

279
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:05,160
to today there's no password reuse

280
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,570
because it was the first system that had

281
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,990
a password so there's that problem gone

282
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:13,460
and you could use basic passwords

283
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:16,170
because your risk surface was so small

284
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:18,720
but the way passwords worked back then

285
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:20,310
the first time ever it's still pretty

286
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,540
much the same as they work today you've

287
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,920
got two strings in your head once a

288
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:24,060
username one's your password if the ones

289
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:28,740
in your head match the ones in your

290
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:30,390
system you get to log in job done but

291
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,210
the 60s is very very different to today

292
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:36,990
yet the same mechanism is how pretty

293
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:38,280
much every system we use today works so

294
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,690
that was the sixties now we move forward

295
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,550
go forward a couple of decades get to

296
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:44,730
the 80s we start getting connected

297
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:47,160
systems so this was a press tell and

298
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:50,310
press tell was used by about 90,000

299
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,900
people you'd plug this computer India TV

300
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:53,969
because we didn't have computer monitors

301
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:57,360
in the home at the time you'd plug it

302
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:57,990
into a modem and you dial in once you

303
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:01,320
dialed in

304
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:04,830
you'd authenticate this is a little BBC

305
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:07,260
clip which shows how to log in to the

306
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:09,830
press tell the press tell computers now

307
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:13,220
ask we twins my own personal password

308
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:13,220
which I've now done

309
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:22,249
everyone get that let's zoom it enhance

310
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:22,939
see what's going on right like one two

311
00:12:22,249 --> 00:12:25,249
three four

312
00:12:22,939 --> 00:12:26,868
so what we're sort of seeing here is

313
00:12:25,249 --> 00:12:28,610
humans taking the path of least

314
00:12:26,869 --> 00:12:30,170
resistance it's like ah something's in

315
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:32,179
my way how quickly can I get around this

316
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:34,279
thing not much quicker than one two

317
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:35,869
three four I assume the minimum length

318
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:36,860
of the password was four otherwise it

319
00:12:35,869 --> 00:12:39,829
would have been one two three or

320
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:42,410
something like that so this is now more

321
00:12:39,829 --> 00:12:43,758
problematic than MIT in the 60s because

322
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:46,249
it's a connected system you've got

323
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:48,980
people remote you've got more people

324
00:12:46,249 --> 00:12:52,490
with enough knowledge to use the system

325
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:53,689
compared to the 60s we go forward

326
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:55,550
another couple of decades get to

327
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:58,309
internet era get to the 90s we've got

328
00:12:55,550 --> 00:13:01,729
millions of websites billions of people

329
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:03,679
using them and people are using bad

330
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,610
passwords like in the Presto so we said

331
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:07,160
all right we're going to fix this the

332
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:09,170
way we're going to fix this is we're

333
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:12,110
going to create password complexity

334
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,610
rules now we've got a bit of file

335
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:14,899
footage of Bob here that Bob's trying to

336
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,519
create an account on a website and the

337
00:13:14,899 --> 00:13:19,339
website says to keep your password

338
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:20,779
secure it must have at least one

339
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:22,970
lowercase character at least one

340
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:24,860
uppercase character it's got to have a

341
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:26,660
number it's got to have a non

342
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:29,149
alphanumeric character it's got to be at

343
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,799
least eight characters long you can't

344
00:13:29,149 --> 00:13:35,559
have used it in any of the last three

345
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:38,149
passwords and now Bob is losing his mind

346
00:13:35,559 --> 00:13:41,449
because he can't create a password and

347
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:46,309
we have all been there right it is

348
00:13:41,449 --> 00:13:49,008
painful so what do we do we create

349
00:13:46,309 --> 00:13:55,189
passwords like this and this is a good

350
00:13:49,009 --> 00:13:57,410
password cricket's okay it is a good

351
00:13:55,189 --> 00:14:00,230
password by the mathematical definition

352
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:02,118
of what most people think makes a good

353
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:04,459
password because think it through right

354
00:14:02,119 --> 00:14:05,869
you got upper case lower case number non

355
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:09,559
alphanumeric that's actually 15

356
00:14:05,869 --> 00:14:12,040
characters long too yet we look at this

357
00:14:09,559 --> 00:14:15,559
as humans and we recognize patterns and

358
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:17,449
we think we'll know maybe maybe there's

359
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:20,959
more to password strength than just

360
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:23,779
mathematics yet still it meets that

361
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,369
basic criteria and any one of you could

362
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,689
go back to your places of work on Monday

363
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:30,800
and create this

364
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:34,089
word at the office now if you did that

365
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,920
what is going to happen 90 days from now

366
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:40,009
got a retainer right what are you gonna

367
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:43,759
do 90 days from now you gonna put a 1 on

368
00:14:40,009 --> 00:14:45,139
the end and the funny thing is every

369
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:46,699
time I do this talk there's always

370
00:14:45,139 --> 00:14:48,170
everyone just going yeah just put a 1 on

371
00:14:46,699 --> 00:14:52,430
the end cuz you all do it I know you do

372
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:55,370
it I've seen your passwords so so we do

373
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:58,849
this and again it's humans circumventing

374
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:01,610
the controls that get put in place we

375
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:03,110
know this the hackers know this like I

376
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:07,040
hate to break it to you they have worked

377
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:08,589
this stuff out and time goes by and we

378
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,040
just keep incrementing the number

379
00:15:08,589 --> 00:15:14,300
because this thing is in our way and

380
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:15,620
there's a fun trick you can do so take

381
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,109
the number that's at the end of your

382
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:18,970
password right now divide it by 4 that's

383
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:23,029
how long you've been at the company

384
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:24,740
works doesn't it so this is all very

385
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:27,560
very predictable we know what's

386
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:29,389
happening but what happens is when we

387
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:32,300
enforce arbitrary complexity rules and

388
00:15:29,389 --> 00:15:35,269
we force rotation people take shortcuts

389
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:37,699
they do things to try and remember what

390
00:15:35,269 --> 00:15:40,279
the password was which actually weakens

391
00:15:37,699 --> 00:15:43,670
it I'll give you a perfect example of

392
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:45,290
this remember last year in Hawaii that

393
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,219
emergency response system went off and

394
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,719
everyone thought I were going to get

395
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:50,360
bombed because their phones started

396
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:52,430
getting all the messages they went and

397
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,959
interviewed this guy afterwards and he's

398
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:56,209
here in this Emergency Response Center

399
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:57,649
and they're kind of interviewing me know

400
00:15:56,209 --> 00:16:00,439
like what happened why did the thing go

401
00:15:57,649 --> 00:16:01,670
off where they're real any bombs and

402
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:04,189
he's standing in front of the screens

403
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:07,759
there and there's there's something

404
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:10,339
alarming down here they're still using

405
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:13,339
Internet Explorer and he's got his

406
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:16,009
password pasted on screen and this is

407
00:16:13,339 --> 00:16:17,660
what happens and again is people trying

408
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:19,970
to find the shortcuts around the

409
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,680
controls that are standing between them

410
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:25,279
and doing the thing that they're there

411
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:27,378
to do in the first place so this is

412
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,579
changing and here's where it gets sort

413
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:30,350
of interesting there's a couple of

414
00:16:28,579 --> 00:16:31,609
really interesting things that are

415
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:33,199
starting to come out from industry

416
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:35,660
bodies about how we should do this

417
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,769
differently and the first one I thought

418
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,719
we'd touch ons from NIST

419
00:16:36,769 --> 00:16:40,080
so in this came out a couple of years

420
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:43,470
ago and said

421
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,640
we should not impose composition rules

422
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:48,089
for memorized secrets

423
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:50,330
so verifiers applications shouldn't say

424
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:53,149
uppercase lowercase off in America

425
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:55,230
because it's such a predictable result

426
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:56,279
yeah you think about if you went and

427
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,630
tried you just use a lowercase

428
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:59,399
pass-through and it says now you got to

429
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:01,079
have an uppercase as well okay so your

430
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:02,339
uppercase the first character got to

431
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:03,329
have a number as well you put a 1 on the

432
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:05,309
end got to have a non alphanumeric

433
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:07,948
character you put an exclamation mark on

434
00:17:05,309 --> 00:17:09,530
the end it is so predictable time and

435
00:17:07,949 --> 00:17:11,910
time and time again

436
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:16,319
stop requiring this because people take

437
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:20,250
shortcuts make things worse the NCSC in

438
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:21,839
the UK around the similar time said you

439
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,550
should only ask users to change their

440
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,520
passwords on indication of suspicion of

441
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:28,919
compromise unless you think the password

442
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:32,790
has been compromised stop forcing people

443
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:34,650
to rotate it now they don't just say get

444
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:36,178
rid of stuff either they say look stop

445
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:37,950
doing that but there are other things

446
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:41,730
that we can do now that we couldn't do

447
00:17:37,950 --> 00:17:43,920
before we have almost ubiquitous 2fa

448
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:45,660
we've got things like u2f tokens we've

449
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,840
got user behavioral analytics we can see

450
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:50,130
deviations from the norm we've also got

451
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:52,290
more encrypted networks than ever as

452
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:54,390
well so the exposure of passwords is

453
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:58,440
different to what it was say even just

454
00:17:54,390 --> 00:18:00,000
10 years ago lent 20 years so this is

455
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,500
how passwords are evolving and how we

456
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,679
need to start thinking differently about

457
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,970
them and over time these will start to

458
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:07,260
filter through more Microsoft just

459
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:10,200
recently updated a bunch of their

460
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:12,600
baseline guidance for Windows Server and

461
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:16,350
for desktop PCs so look we're going to

462
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:19,770
remove the rotation requirement things

463
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:23,250
are progressing now also on the Soviet

464
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:25,679
passwords we're seeing huge exposures of

465
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:30,840
them in numbers that we've never seen

466
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:32,850
before this was in January and there

467
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:35,370
emerged what was referred to as

468
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:38,610
collection 1 and collection 1 was a list

469
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:39,989
of usernames and passwords peers often

470
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:43,250
referred to as a credential stuffing

471
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:45,150
list someone sent this data to me and

472
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,980
turned out there were seven hundred and

473
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:49,169
seventy three million email addresses in

474
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,059
there there were more than a billion

475
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,980
passwords because many email addresses

476
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:53,760
had more than one password and this was

477
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,050
an amalgam

478
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,320
nation of different breaches from

479
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:59,520
different services I was in there

480
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:02,939
including a password I'd used in the

481
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:08,040
past and people take these lists and

482
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:11,040
then exploit the victims why I picked it

483
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:13,680
up seen it picked it up 21 million

484
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:14,639
unique passwords also do the math seven

485
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:16,710
hundred and seventy three million emails

486
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,840
but only 21 million unique passwords

487
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:22,200
what does that tell you I'm not so good

488
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,399
with the passwords fortune I always find

489
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,350
the fortune stuff interesting because

490
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,460
now it's like consumer mainstream media

491
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:27,659
this is not just technical people

492
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:31,260
anymore the sort of thing my parents

493
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:32,400
would read here's how to find out if

494
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,020
your email address was one of them they

495
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,190
sent people to have I been part I got 10

496
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:39,180
million people come to the site in the

497
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:42,480
day that was fun I don't think I've

498
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:44,580
recovered quite yet now often you see

499
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,510
this sort of stuff and a combination of

500
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,669
the press and I think a lot of the

501
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:49,170
masses they go are must have been on the

502
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:50,580
dark web because I keep hearing about

503
00:19:49,170 --> 00:19:52,290
the dark web the dark web sounds very

504
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,550
scary this is where the criminals go and

505
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:56,430
they distribute the data and they sell

506
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:59,159
the drugs and everything now a lot of

507
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:02,100
this is on the dark web it's also on

508
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:04,530
Twitter and this is the reality of it

509
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,659
most of the time when people send me

510
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:08,190
data is floating around the clear web I

511
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,570
know it doesn't sound as scary and I'm

512
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,800
so sorry for the vendors who are trying

513
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:12,149
to sell stuff just based on what's on

514
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:15,690
the dark web but a lot of it is just

515
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:17,010
floating around in the clear so this

516
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:20,310
says you can see his collections 1

517
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:23,100
through 5 I had collection 1 773 million

518
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:28,200
unique email addresses that was about 8%

519
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:30,000
of all the collections combined so this

520
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,680
float around Twitter it's on mega dens

521
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,210
add a lot of the data I see gets

522
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:37,410
redistributed on mega because it's a

523
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:38,520
good file-sharing service raises the

524
00:20:37,410 --> 00:20:40,980
question what do people do with this

525
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:43,080
right so imagine you've got let's say

526
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,940
round numbers you've got a billion email

527
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:48,270
address password combinations what do

528
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:50,070
you then do with them I won't put a bit

529
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:54,060
of a clip there's another tutorial about

530
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:55,710
how to abuse credential pairs so what

531
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:59,669
we're going to see is how to mount a

532
00:20:55,710 --> 00:21:01,710
credential stuffing attack or what is

533
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:03,030
going on with these no welcome back to a

534
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:05,040
brand new video here on

535
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:07,530
in this video I'm gonna be showing you

536
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:09,300
guys a checker of me for Spotify account

537
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,960
so you can check if the accounts are

538
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:12,930
valid

539
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,670
now Spotify really really frequently

540
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:15,990
features as the target of credential

541
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:17,940
stuffing attacks I get emails from

542
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:19,410
people all the time they go hate you see

543
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,420
Spotify had a data breach because a

544
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:24,630
whole bunch of credentials have appeared

545
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:27,570
on pastebin now this is not generally

546
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:29,220
what has happened and we're gonna see as

547
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:32,639
this guy goes through the process how

548
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,660
Spotify has a air quotes data breach so

549
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,970
let's have a look at the checker he's

550
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:37,500
made but before we start I just want to

551
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:38,490
say that this is for educational

552
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,410
purposes only

553
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:42,420
hey this is obviously not made for

554
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:43,800
checking cracked accounts you guys know

555
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,260
what I mean this is for checking your

556
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,180
own accounts if you guys got multiple so

557
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,670
you guys don't have to check one by one

558
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:51,450
and this will make it a lot easier

559
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:52,040
alright so let's just be clear about

560
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:56,370
this

561
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:58,490
you have so many Spotify accounts you

562
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:01,320
can't remember which ones work anymore

563
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:04,350
so you need this script to go and check

564
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,360
your credentials keep this in mind it

565
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:09,120
will also tell you guys if the account

566
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:12,780
is a Spotify Premium Spotify family or a

567
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,159
Spotify student whatever you have so

568
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:17,100
many you also can't remember what type

569
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,510
of account you created but you'd like to

570
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,120
know it would be nice if there was a

571
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:23,129
tool to help you establish this but

572
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,290
before you open this actual program I'm

573
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:26,340
gonna make sure you have combos all

574
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:28,770
right now as we start to get to the

575
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:31,590
pointy end of it so combos are username

576
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:32,970
password combinations and we're seeing

577
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:34,560
like one tiny tiny little bit of a

578
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:36,510
snapshot of what a credential stuffing

579
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,730
list looks like email address password

580
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:42,120
over and over and over again a billion

581
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:44,490
times so let's have a look at what he

582
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:47,280
does with the combo you're gonna type in

583
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:49,740
combos and it dreads let's do four this

584
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,480
time so it goes a bit faster so as you

585
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:53,310
guys can see already we got eight hits

586
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,799
as he gets to see it keeps getting here

587
00:22:53,310 --> 00:22:56,649
it is

588
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:58,269
accounts are high-quality aka HQ as you

589
00:22:56,649 --> 00:22:59,439
guys can see we keep getting hits I

590
00:22:58,269 --> 00:23:01,779
don't care if you guys steal these

591
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:06,129
accounts I have about 9,000 at the

592
00:23:01,779 --> 00:23:10,029
moment all his - it's rather miraculous

593
00:23:06,129 --> 00:23:12,009
isn't it now all he's done here is his

594
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:13,629
script he's gone to Spotify and he's had

595
00:23:12,009 --> 00:23:15,369
a look let's ask the Spotify API for

596
00:23:13,629 --> 00:23:16,809
example sits behind the mobile app he's

597
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:18,699
looked at it he said okay what's the

598
00:23:16,809 --> 00:23:20,408
HTTP request pattern which logs on

599
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:22,029
that's a post request to this path

600
00:23:20,409 --> 00:23:23,980
there's a field called password and a

601
00:23:22,029 --> 00:23:25,720
field called username I'm just going to

602
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:27,129
automate that and then I'm going to

603
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:29,350
multi thread it and I'm going to pass in

604
00:23:27,129 --> 00:23:31,529
a big list go outside and play Bob's

605
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:34,629
your uncle now he's got 9,000 accounts

606
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:37,179
the challenge for us and challenge for

607
00:23:34,629 --> 00:23:39,639
you guys is how do you defend against

608
00:23:37,179 --> 00:23:41,470
that how do you defend against a request

609
00:23:39,639 --> 00:23:43,149
coming to your site legitimate username

610
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:45,970
legitimate and password but not the

611
00:23:43,149 --> 00:23:48,549
actual person that owns it and this is

612
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:50,830
becoming a really really big problem and

613
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:52,509
there are so many tutorials like this

614
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:54,100
out there I wrote a blog post recently

615
00:23:52,509 --> 00:23:56,200
about the fact that most of these

616
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,488
Spotify breaches I say just successful

617
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,950
credential stuffing and I embedded a

618
00:23:57,489 --> 00:24:01,299
video and then it got taken offline so

619
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:03,879
embedded another one it got taken

620
00:24:01,299 --> 00:24:05,470
offline so I embedded this one and it's

621
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:08,590
still there there's just a heap of them

622
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:10,899
they're all over YouTube so data

623
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:14,799
breaches and passwords are a massive

624
00:24:10,899 --> 00:24:18,309
thing data breaches and connected things

625
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:21,100
are also becoming a massive thing and I

626
00:24:18,309 --> 00:24:23,230
thought I'd touch on a few which have

627
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:25,570
hit either have I been pwned or my radar

628
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:28,570
in recent times and the first ones this

629
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:31,869
one has anyone got one of these thank

630
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:33,970
God okay so here's the value proposition

631
00:24:31,869 --> 00:24:36,759
this is a cloud pet so imagine you've

632
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:38,499
got a kid in bed you know wanting to

633
00:24:36,759 --> 00:24:40,450
talk to Mum cuz she's working late and

634
00:24:38,499 --> 00:24:42,549
phones are boring so why not get them a

635
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:45,549
connected teddy bear with a microphone

636
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:48,580
in it and put it in their bed I know so

637
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:49,869
anyway this is what they were they're

638
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:51,609
basically dead now the company's gone

639
00:24:49,869 --> 00:24:52,840
bankrupt but they're connected teddy

640
00:24:51,609 --> 00:24:54,369
bears they've got a little light that

641
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,480
flashes when a message comes in they've

642
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:56,759
got a button in the poor they've got a

643
00:24:55,480 --> 00:25:00,159
microphone I've got a speaker

644
00:24:56,759 --> 00:25:02,980
now when you record a message through

645
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:06,549
this it goes up into the magic of the

646
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:07,360
cloud and it's stored up their cloud

647
00:25:06,549 --> 00:25:11,410
pets store

648
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:16,840
all of their data in a MongoDB publicly

649
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:19,900
facing without a password and then it

650
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:21,370
looked like this your database is backed

651
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,320
up in our servers send one Bitcoin to

652
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:27,429
this address and send your IP to that

653
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:28,929
email address now there are about five

654
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:31,240
hundred and sixty odd thousand accounts

655
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:33,180
and there someone did grab them sent

656
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,820
them to me for ever been pwned

657
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:38,140
but then it later got ransomed like this

658
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:39,250
now we know that this is what it looks

659
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,630
like because we pulled logs at a

660
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:42,130
showdown and we can go back and actually

661
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:45,400
see the state of the database at the

662
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:47,290
time we also know that to other people

663
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:50,890
subsequently came along and changed the

664
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:52,629
Bitcoin address to their own which okay

665
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:54,100
it is kind of alright you know you don't

666
00:25:52,630 --> 00:25:59,410
have to do the crime maybe you get some

667
00:25:54,100 --> 00:26:01,600
of the proceeds incidently no way it's

668
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:03,940
backed up either it's just been Newt and

669
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,629
the thing is is that this happened and

670
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:10,060
then the cloud pets came back online and

671
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:15,730
nobody got told so these are the company

672
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:18,040
new continuing the IOT thread we're

673
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:20,440
seeing IOT in all sorts of places we

674
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:22,750
never had it before in cars for example

675
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:25,900
so this is an S and leaf the Ness and

676
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:27,280
leaf has a companion app so that you can

677
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,590
do things like pull back the battery

678
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:32,920
status it's an Eevee you can pull back

679
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:35,590
the trip history you can also control

680
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:38,920
features of the car so you can turn the

681
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:41,199
heating on I was in Norway doing a

682
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,850
workshop and we do this exercise where

683
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,890
you you take your phone you route it

684
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:46,270
through your PC you have a look at the

685
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:47,980
traffic going backwards and forwards

686
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:49,450
just by naturally using an API and

687
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:51,640
actually using an app that hits api's

688
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:53,650
and you draw certain conclusions about

689
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,090
the security posture and one of the

690
00:26:53,650 --> 00:26:57,280
blokes in my workshop

691
00:26:55,090 --> 00:27:01,899
had one of these cars and he was curious

692
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:03,940
he said I wonder how my phone knows

693
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:05,890
which car to turn the heater on

694
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:06,970
because in Norway it's so cold you've

695
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:08,290
got to be able to turn the heater on

696
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:11,080
before you get into or you freeze to

697
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:13,149
death or something like that so he's all

698
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,949
right there's must be some sort of API

699
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:18,190
cue but maybe as a bearer token or

700
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:19,570
something stored within the app and then

701
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:20,830
when I go and turn the heater on sends

702
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:22,600
the bearer token over a secure

703
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:25,600
connection turns on my car doesn't mess

704
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:27,399
with anyone else's car so he proxies his

705
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:30,010
phone through his PC he looks at the

706
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:33,489
traffic and he discovers that the API

707
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:36,789
key so the secret that allows you to

708
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:40,059
control features of a car is printed in

709
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:44,830
the windscreen of the car they used the

710
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:46,029
VIN number as the API key now not only

711
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:47,439
is it printed in the windscreen of a car

712
00:27:46,029 --> 00:27:49,149
so you can walk around and start taking

713
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,809
photos of cars and go in my car my car

714
00:27:49,149 --> 00:27:52,750
my car

715
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:54,190
you can also enumerate them because the

716
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:55,630
last five digits you can just keep

717
00:27:54,190 --> 00:28:00,639
guessing numbers and finding more cars

718
00:27:55,630 --> 00:28:02,500
and this was another example of how hard

719
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:03,939
it is also to get organizations do the

720
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,529
right thing so after he found this I got

721
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:07,899
in touch with ness and privately and

722
00:28:05,529 --> 00:28:09,870
said look I think you should kind of fix

723
00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:13,000
your cars because this isn't real good

724
00:28:09,870 --> 00:28:15,459
and I said yeah we'll fix it this is

725
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,840
very important and eventually they just

726
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:20,080
grew a bit tired of it they stopped

727
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:21,908
answering my emails and it took a month

728
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,529
before I discovered that someone else

729
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:25,419
had found the same vulnerability and the

730
00:28:23,529 --> 00:28:27,340
way I discovered this is there's a forum

731
00:28:25,419 --> 00:28:29,799
where people were commenting on how

732
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:31,928
terrible the mobile app is and someone

733
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:33,190
reverse engineered it and said hey look

734
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:34,929
all you got to do is go to this URL

735
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:37,210
replace the VIN number with yours put

736
00:28:34,929 --> 00:28:39,100
that as a favorite in your browser and

737
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:40,630
then when you get up in the morning you

738
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:45,219
just go to the bookmark job done heaters

739
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:46,840
on so that had to go public because they

740
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:48,519
wouldn't fix it they decided it was

741
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:51,580
important after it went public amazing

742
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:53,799
thing and this is one of the issues we

743
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:57,010
see organizations having trouble dealing

744
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:59,889
with security incidents as well we had

745
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:02,710
an issue just locally only a couple of

746
00:28:59,889 --> 00:29:04,178
months ago similar sort of deal there's

747
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:07,110
a company called tick tock track and

748
00:29:04,179 --> 00:29:09,399
they make a GPS tracking watch for kids

749
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:10,779
in fact they don't actually make the

750
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:13,330
watch the watch is made by a company

751
00:29:10,779 --> 00:29:14,740
called Gaeta they make the application

752
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:18,070
layer that sits on top of it they make

753
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:20,500
the mobile app they make the api's and a

754
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:23,168
mate of mine in the UK a guy from a pen

755
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,220
testing firm called Ken Monroe Ken

756
00:29:23,169 --> 00:29:26,340
reached out and he said look we've been

757
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:29,110
looking at a bunch of these watches and

758
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:31,000
they're kind of as terrible as what you

759
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:32,889
would expect a really cheap internet

760
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,390
connected device to be

761
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:36,160
and they'd found a whole bunch of

762
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:38,320
problems in late 2017 in fact that found

763
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:41,140
so many problems that we had things like

764
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,169
Norwegian consumer protection council

765
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:45,250
saying just don't get these things

766
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:46,870
Germany banned them they're just like

767
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,460
nope destroy them they literally said

768
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:49,870
destroy them because they're also sharp

769
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:52,780
- she's listening devices you'll see

770
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:54,250
this in a moment so he believed that

771
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:56,889
there was a security vulnerability in

772
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:59,140
these he needed someone in Australia so

773
00:29:56,890 --> 00:30:01,810
he called me and wen and got one of

774
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:03,220
these and I had to go to the website in

775
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:05,110
order to purchase it so I went to the

776
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:09,390
site and then I saw there was a padlock

777
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:11,860
and I felt much better no not really

778
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:14,590
also noticed in that second power there

779
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:16,419
it says we take the security of your

780
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:19,300
data seriously now normally when I see

781
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:20,800
someone say that it's in the breach

782
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,740
notice which is explaining how they just

783
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:27,159
didn't so it's not really a good leading

784
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:28,570
statement in my experience so anyway I

785
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,920
thought I'll go and get one anyway

786
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:32,320
because this is interesting right like

787
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,700
we want to see is this vulnerability

788
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,280
which Ken believes is in the watch

789
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,890
actually there so I want to got one and

790
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,510
I put it on my six-year-old daughter

791
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:42,310
so this is our and as you can see it's

792
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:44,290
it's branded gaiter it's made by Gator

793
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:47,679
in China and then tick tock Trek put

794
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:50,470
there a player on top and we started

795
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:54,820
having a look at the api's and we found

796
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:55,930
an api like this and it says yeah get

797
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:58,060
users this is going to pull back

798
00:30:55,930 --> 00:31:00,970
information about the family and all you

799
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:05,260
do is pass through an ID now because

800
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:07,480
Kansas smart guy and he can count he can

801
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:10,090
hack so all he did is change the number

802
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:11,230
change the number another family like

803
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:13,629
this is the level of sophistication

804
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:18,250
these are physical devices that we're

805
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:20,470
using to look after our children so when

806
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:22,450
you hit that API response comes back it

807
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:24,970
says here's your family we get a whole

808
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:30,220
bunch of JSON back here there's my email

809
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:32,740
address name then you can start making

810
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:35,200
calls to other eight the eyes so you can

811
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:38,230
go out and actually get yourself a child

812
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,610
and I know this is alarming why is this

813
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:42,370
a post request when you're pulling back

814
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:43,929
an entity this is not right anyway also

815
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:46,758
you can just change the ID and pull back

816
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:49,070
another family now that there was all

817
00:31:46,759 --> 00:31:51,879
earth on this and it went like this are

818
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:55,279
you authenticated yes sweet go for it

819
00:31:51,879 --> 00:31:56,539
it's not like I authenticated also are

820
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:57,529
you actually trying to retrieve the

821
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:59,929
entity that you're authorized to

822
00:31:57,529 --> 00:32:03,109
retrieve so that that bit was kind of

823
00:31:59,929 --> 00:32:04,699
missing and for any of you that actually

824
00:32:03,109 --> 00:32:06,799
tests this stuff and look for it this is

825
00:32:04,699 --> 00:32:08,329
like one of the most obvious things that

826
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,399
you would look for one of the absolute

827
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:13,759
first things in secured direct object

828
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:16,189
references the gift that keeps giving so

829
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:18,949
you could retrieve a child you could

830
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:20,749
relocate a child and this is where it

831
00:32:18,949 --> 00:32:22,549
starts to get weird because parents have

832
00:32:20,749 --> 00:32:25,059
these things in order to track where the

833
00:32:22,549 --> 00:32:27,199
children's our children's our kids are

834
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:28,759
so the problem there is that if you can

835
00:32:27,199 --> 00:32:31,190
start to relocate the child to some

836
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:33,349
arbitrary location it kind of completely

837
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:34,659
destroys the whole premise of having the

838
00:32:33,349 --> 00:32:37,729
watch in the first place

839
00:32:34,659 --> 00:32:40,549
so we tested it we sent hell off to

840
00:32:37,729 --> 00:32:42,649
tennis just over here in Southport and I

841
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:44,449
opened up the app and she was that

842
00:32:42,649 --> 00:32:46,129
tennis and me and my helicopter parent

843
00:32:44,449 --> 00:32:50,289
modem are good I know she's safe

844
00:32:46,129 --> 00:32:52,639
and then Ken dumped her in the ocean

845
00:32:50,289 --> 00:32:55,339
because he can do this because he can

846
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:59,059
put her wherever he wants because Ken

847
00:32:55,339 --> 00:33:01,819
can count got worse than that as well

848
00:32:59,059 --> 00:33:06,019
and that the bit that got worse is that

849
00:33:01,819 --> 00:33:07,879
these Watchers do take a 3G SIM card so

850
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:09,949
they can operate as a phone as well so

851
00:33:07,879 --> 00:33:11,928
the parent can call the child but it

852
00:33:09,949 --> 00:33:14,569
would be weird if just any person could

853
00:33:11,929 --> 00:33:16,429
call the child so there's an API that

854
00:33:14,569 --> 00:33:17,719
lets you set who the parent is and by

855
00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:20,929
now you can probably see where this is

856
00:33:17,719 --> 00:33:22,399
going to be going so Ken gets hold of

857
00:33:20,929 --> 00:33:24,440
the API and he said look we're going to

858
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:28,428
make some changes we want to give you a

859
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:30,379
call so we get out in her bed and he

860
00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:33,019
gets one of his colleagues Vangelis he

861
00:33:30,379 --> 00:33:34,849
said look Vangelis yeah obviously you've

862
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:37,969
found the vulnerability in the API let's

863
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:41,198
let's see what we can do with this so I

864
00:33:37,969 --> 00:33:41,199
have a look at what Vangelis does

865
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:46,450
[Music]

866
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:54,799
[Music]

867
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:02,140
[Music]

868
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:12,179
and when I first saw them I was like

869
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:14,009
holy this is actually feels really

870
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:17,460
scary like our kyle is there videoing it

871
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:19,740
but it just why is this possible and

872
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:22,309
then I remembered what ken can count and

873
00:34:19,739 --> 00:34:24,808
this is what we have where we are

874
00:34:22,309 --> 00:34:27,059
so these vulnerabilities keep popping up

875
00:34:24,809 --> 00:34:28,559
again and again again and to their

876
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:30,990
credit tik-tok track did actually take

877
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:32,250
the service down very very quickly but

878
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:33,658
they had a lot of trouble actually

879
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:35,699
understanding what went wrong and

880
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:37,589
started throwing around blame and things

881
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:39,388
like this and this is one of the

882
00:34:37,589 --> 00:34:41,069
problems we have as well there's so many

883
00:34:39,389 --> 00:34:43,409
organizations out there that just aren't

884
00:34:41,069 --> 00:34:46,589
equipped to deal with the data breach of

885
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:49,289
any kind who don't realize that people

886
00:34:46,589 --> 00:34:50,969
like Ken Monroe is a legitimate

887
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:52,740
straightforward guy who's only there

888
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:55,138
trying to fix broken things like this

889
00:34:52,739 --> 00:34:57,299
and I thought look we should sort of end

890
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:58,770
this on a really good example of how

891
00:34:57,299 --> 00:35:02,390
companies are having trouble

892
00:34:58,770 --> 00:35:05,279
communicating and I saw a recent case

893
00:35:02,390 --> 00:35:08,190
involving this now this is a biometric

894
00:35:05,279 --> 00:35:09,869
padlock and there's a guy called the

895
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:11,640
lock picking lawyer he's got a YouTube

896
00:35:09,869 --> 00:35:13,710
channel where he does physical

897
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,940
penetration testing of padlocks it's

898
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:16,589
really fascinating actually gets big

899
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:18,210
locks and things like you know how how

900
00:35:16,589 --> 00:35:20,970
can either pick them or how much effort

901
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:23,549
does it take to break them so anyway

902
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:25,230
he's picked up this lock this biometric

903
00:35:23,549 --> 00:35:28,500
lock and he's gone I look at that as a

904
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:31,170
screw now

905
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:32,819
the screw does exactly what you're

906
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:34,319
thinking it does right it's like you get

907
00:35:32,819 --> 00:35:35,640
your screwdriver out you undo the screw

908
00:35:34,319 --> 00:35:37,680
and the lock opens up that's not the

909
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,730
good bit the good bit is he's like okay

910
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,440
well we got to do the right thing we've

911
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:41,609
got to disclose this privately so he

912
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,020
gets in touch with them and says look

913
00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:45,270
I've got one of your looks I have a

914
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:50,339
screwdriver I managed to get in there

915
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:51,750
and they replied and they said our locks

916
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:53,320
are invincible to people who do not have

917
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:55,930
a screwdriver

918
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:59,310
and this is pretty much where we are

919
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:59,310
today thanks very much

920
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,609
can I just ask it up fantastic

921
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:10,709
presentation one quick question before

922
00:36:08,609 --> 00:36:12,720
we go I judge about the Zuckerberg stuff

923
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:14,700
but I've heard anecdotally that the

924
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,868
stuff that got online about the you know

925
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:17,430
the guys asked me how do you make money

926
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:19,950
out of it when we run ads and all that

927
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:21,598
but in fact that I believe that

928
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:23,430
testimony kept going and there were some

929
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:25,079
senators while some quite informed

930
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:26,308
pointed questions what was your

931
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:28,319
experience of that did some of those

932
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:31,349
people they really know their stuff was

933
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:33,058
an embarrassing how far off the pace

934
00:36:31,349 --> 00:36:34,769
they work and you summarize it in a

935
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:36,359
generalization or did it vary across the

936
00:36:34,769 --> 00:36:38,058
people you spoke so what I actually

937
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:40,769
learned is when they ask questions

938
00:36:38,059 --> 00:36:42,359
they're not their questions yes oh so

939
00:36:40,769 --> 00:36:43,529
they all have liked it in fairness

940
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:46,200
they're there they are doing like

941
00:36:43,529 --> 00:36:47,759
testimonies on things like the opioid

942
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,109
epidemic the day before so they're going

943
00:36:47,759 --> 00:36:50,549
from like serious health care stuff to

944
00:36:49,109 --> 00:36:51,930
serious cyber stuff so they have

945
00:36:50,549 --> 00:36:53,759
staffers that prepare all the questions

946
00:36:51,930 --> 00:37:01,859
and the questions were actually pretty

947
00:36:53,759 --> 00:37:02,970
good I thought so but so the questions

948
00:37:01,859 --> 00:37:04,259
were reasonably pointed what were they

949
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:06,180
trying to get and what do you think they

950
00:37:04,259 --> 00:37:08,339
came away with what did they come away

951
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:10,319
with there's a benefit from the

952
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:11,788
testimony that you guys provided so the

953
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:13,140
premise was what's the impact on

954
00:37:11,789 --> 00:37:14,730
knowledge based authentication so you

955
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:16,078
know how like your bank calls up and

956
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:17,400
they're like we just want to make sure

957
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,779
you are who you are what's your date of

958
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,089
birth and you're like oh crap it's that

959
00:37:18,779 --> 00:37:22,230
thing that's in all these data breaches

960
00:37:20,089 --> 00:37:24,150
they wanted to sort of understand how

961
00:37:22,230 --> 00:37:26,160
that as a means of authentication really

962
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:28,440
doesn't work so well anymore so yeah my

963
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,788
bit was data is all over the web you

964
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,700
really can't rely on this stuff anymore

965
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:34,380
and I think they got that the trick now

966
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,390
is to see what actually comes as a

967
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:38,519
result so this was about 18 months ago

968
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:40,799
we did that has anything happened yet

969
00:37:38,519 --> 00:37:42,058
where are they on are they moving slowly

970
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:43,609
well we still got a hell of a lot of

971
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:46,410
data breaches so hasn't changed that

972
00:37:43,609 --> 00:37:47,369
look I think organizations are moving

973
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:49,410
slowly because we're getting better

974
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:51,869
means of authentication so stuff like

975
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:53,848
u2f keys are now all over the place and

976
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:56,220
lots of support for that so we're kind

977
00:37:53,849 --> 00:37:57,630
of moving in that direction but it's got

978
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:59,189
to be slow cuz the one thing that

979
00:37:57,630 --> 00:38:01,079
knowledge-based authentication does

980
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:02,369
really really well is everyone has

981
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:04,410
