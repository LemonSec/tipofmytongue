1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,360
here to talk on the topic of how

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:05,370
security teams can evolve to win friends

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:09,500
and influence people from tender min

4
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,500
please welcome the wonderful Jesse Erwin

5
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:23,460
I'm totally terrified thank you hello

6
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,769
everyone thank you so much for the

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,119
wonderful welcome Australia you're kind

8
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:29,549
of amazing and cool and I don't wanna go

9
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,549
home by the way no one tell my husband I

10
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,040
said that and thank you all for getting

11
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:38,760
up after what was quite the party last

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:41,640
night and coming to attend my talk today

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:44,550
I am gonna cover a whole bunch of

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,640
stories and opinions and thoughts and

15
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:50,459
feelings about of what we do is security

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:52,260
teams I think that we're at a point as

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,510
an industry where we really have to step

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,629
back and think about our identity and

19
00:00:54,510 --> 00:01:02,339
our work where we are now and where we

20
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:04,319
want to go so that's what this is so

21
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:06,390
you're probably wondering why you have

22
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:08,639
to listen to me today so I might as well

23
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,130
explain when I have to talk about my job

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,930
the only way I can reasonably explain it

25
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,820
whether I'm talking to a bunch of

26
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,500
engineers or I'm talking to

27
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,380
eight-year-olds who just want me to hack

28
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:21,600
their homework is to say that I protect

29
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:25,199
people from software and I protect

30
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,509
software from people I have an extremely

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,549
non-traditional background to be a

32
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:32,220
security engineer when I was in

33
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:35,340
university I studied foreign language I

34
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,798
studied art history I studied

35
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,820
archaeology I worked in a library I

36
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,960
worked in a museum

37
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:46,110
I'm ground zero for inventory being a

38
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,298
security problem I started working on

39
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:51,270
communications in technology when I

40
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,070
first moved to the Silicon Valley so I

41
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,369
used to be one of those marketers that

42
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:58,289
everyone swears sells the snake oil by

43
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:01,939
the way marketing team is amazing you

44
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:04,530
better be nice to them or I will get you

45
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:07,970
when I did that work I learned quite a

46
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:11,068
bit about risk security controls privacy

47
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:12,870
and generally all of these topics that

48
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:13,599
are really really hard for the average

49
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,760
person

50
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,969
to understand and wrap their mind around

51
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,899
when really all they want to do is make

52
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:22,480
the right phone work

53
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:24,219
or figure out how to stand up a VPN so

54
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,969
they can watch Netflix from Canada

55
00:02:24,219 --> 00:02:28,659
instead of Australia or the u.s. because

56
00:02:27,969 --> 00:02:30,989
of this they have a lot of

57
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:33,939
non-traditional ideas about security - I

58
00:02:30,989 --> 00:02:36,010
am the first person to start standing up

59
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:37,840
and screaming that security is way more

60
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,418
than just finding all of the bugs in

61
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,939
code we're supposed to stop the bugs

62
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:46,840
from getting into the code sometimes - I

63
00:02:42,939 --> 00:02:50,409
thought maybe we know quite a lot about

64
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:52,719
how humans work and I think that we

65
00:02:50,409 --> 00:02:55,719
should start designing security for what

66
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:58,120
we know about people not against them if

67
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:00,549
we know for example people are going to

68
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,189
do awful things with passwords we should

69
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:05,730
probably just plan systems around awful

70
00:03:03,189 --> 00:03:08,620
passwords and see what we get out of it

71
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:11,679
and finally one of my other crazy ideas

72
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:14,199
is that usability is very much a

73
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,719
security problem and more of our

74
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:20,379
security problems that we face stem from

75
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:22,780
IT mishaps than some evil awful sneaky

76
00:03:20,379 --> 00:03:24,879
nation-state adversary getting up in our

77
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:30,189
business and wrecking our Monday through

78
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:31,388
Friday and our on-call weekends so I'm

79
00:03:30,189 --> 00:03:33,668
gonna talk a little bit about a few

80
00:03:31,389 --> 00:03:35,699
things today I want to do a little bit

81
00:03:33,669 --> 00:03:37,840
of a deep dive into what security is

82
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:39,790
because I don't really even know if we

83
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:42,159
know what it is to be honest but it's

84
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,720
been around for a long time I'll talk a

85
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,939
little bit about how we can win friends

86
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:48,250
I mean I did say in the title we

87
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:51,250
probably need to cover this a little bit

88
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:54,430
maybe how to influence people but not in

89
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:55,750
a creepy way in a good way I don't know

90
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,189
what we're gonna do in the middle but

91
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:59,199
somewhere we'll get to the point where

92
00:03:57,189 --> 00:04:01,719
we talk about how we actually improve

93
00:03:59,199 --> 00:04:04,239
outcomes and how we get to make more of

94
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:05,978
a difference and I don't know like maybe

95
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:09,780
go kick everybody's butt and be really

96
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:09,780
competitive and win for a change

97
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:17,829
so okay what is this security thing that

98
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:21,459
we are doing security has existed pretty

99
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:24,010
much since we have as humans it's been

100
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:26,320
around at least 50,000 years longer than

101
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:27,130
computers and a lot of people these days

102
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,380
think that

103
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:33,790
security is a huge technology question

104
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:35,860
it's not actually in my opinion ah those

105
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,540
people who do tell us that it is a

106
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,800
technology problem there are also the

107
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,500
people saying that software is eating

108
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,560
the world news for you

109
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:47,170
we've only had software for like less

110
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,900
than a hundred years there were a lot of

111
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:52,470
us around before that and we engaged in

112
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:55,390
a lot of different behaviors as people

113
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:58,120
that really demonstrate security

114
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,950
principles one thing I've learned in the

115
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:02,050
work that I've done is that our beliefs

116
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:05,229
in security as individuals as

117
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:07,000
practitioners as consumers as people who

118
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:09,340
buy iPhones and want to chuck them out

119
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,560
the window when they don't work they're

120
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:15,549
about as deeply held is our belief in

121
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:18,010
politics and religion our ideas about

122
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:20,950
security are very much a product of our

123
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:23,530
life experiences and because of that

124
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:26,950
what we might consider to be right or

125
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:30,369
wrong or correct in our work is

126
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:33,930
extremely relative to this this is

127
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:36,490
something you know to be a very very

128
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:39,010
self-evident truth if you've ever gotten

129
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:41,590
into a conversation about a password

130
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:46,420
manager on our InfoSec water-cooler

131
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:48,549
named twitter because people i found

132
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:53,680
when i worked at one password would

133
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:55,330
basically choose to reject or accept a

134
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,670
password manager as if they were

135
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:01,120
choosing between the old gods the New

136
00:05:57,670 --> 00:06:03,100
Gods the flying dragon gods or no gods

137
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,530
for me thanks like it's an episode of

138
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:07,840
Game of Thrones what's interesting about

139
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:10,419
this is when you start talking to people

140
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:13,719
online about password managers or you

141
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:16,990
see a discussion going on the moment

142
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:19,660
someone disagrees with a personal choice

143
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:21,610
of which product which tool whether you

144
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:25,900
should even use that class of software

145
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:28,360
or not it turns into an all-out holy war

146
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:30,880
of authentication what's interesting

147
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,490
about this is that the choice of whether

148
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,440
to use a password manager or not is an

149
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:37,450
extremely personal choice and for many

150
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,740
people it's also the most important

151
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,659
decision they're going to make about

152
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:43,810
their online security

153
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:46,410
and if there's one thing that is crystal

154
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:48,730
clear if you criticize the most

155
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:50,890
important choice that someone makes

156
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:53,770
about their security if you make them

157
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:56,080
feel bad for using you know purple pass

158
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:59,140
instead of yellow pass there will be

159
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:01,210
hell to pay it's an insult to the

160
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:03,430
intelligence of most people to the

161
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:05,680
experiences that led them to making that

162
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:08,530
decision or rejecting that decision and

163
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,470
it is all around probably one of the

164
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:15,880
most interesting as technology adoption

165
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:17,710
cases in our industry so okay I

166
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:20,560
mentioned Security's been around for

167
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:22,479
about 50,000 years give or take

168
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:25,570
I mentioned that we've seen lots of

169
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,920
evidence of security behaviors but

170
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,469
there's something that's really

171
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:32,320
interesting that I can never look away

172
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:35,830
from when people started living in

173
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:38,770
constructed settlements about 17,000

174
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:41,289
years ago they started building walls to

175
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:43,570
protect themselves almost instantly I

176
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:45,760
think the first thing I figured out how

177
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:49,180
to break when I started using a computer

178
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:51,330
was called a firewall and suddenly all

179
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:54,340
of these magical things made sense to me

180
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:56,830
when people started living in

181
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:59,140
settlements they also started securing

182
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:01,950
their valuables by hiding them we see

183
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:04,570
evidence of this to this day when

184
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:06,490
archaeologists are going and digging and

185
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:09,730
looking for forensic evidence of past

186
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:11,320
peoples and they start finding coin

187
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,310
hoards with more money than they could

188
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,770
have ever imagined

189
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:17,470
because people had to protect the thing

190
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:19,390
most valuable to them and it's not like

191
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,980
they had a crazy modern banking system

192
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:23,380
and debit cards and all of these

193
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:26,710
fabulous tokens for payment that we get

194
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:29,230
to have now another thing that's really

195
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:32,319
interesting some of the earliest

196
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:35,349
evidence of security comes from locks

197
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:38,560
and there are so many locks when you

198
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:41,250
look in the historical record that come

199
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,909
from as far back as ancient Egypt

200
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:46,480
something I think is really interesting

201
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:48,520
is these days we run around with our key

202
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,360
cards to get into our office building we

203
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:53,920
have our UV keys and our u2f tokens

204
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,920
people use to wear their key

205
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,979
to their locks like a pendant have them

206
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:02,050
made into a ring or put them in a place

207
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,769
close to them for safekeeping so that

208
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:07,060
they were always physically secure and

209
00:09:04,769 --> 00:09:10,660
it was a little bit of an indicator of

210
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:11,949
wealth but really what it said was you

211
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:15,100
were bound to have something valuable

212
00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:17,199
enough that needed protecting if you had

213
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,870
one of these things it reminds me a

214
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:21,699
little bit now of when I see someone get

215
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:23,380
really excited and make a pair of

216
00:09:21,699 --> 00:09:24,729
earrings out of you B keys because

217
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:27,790
that's a pretty good way not to lose

218
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:30,339
them and also the kind of fun and it

219
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:32,980
also reminds me of how we see people

220
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:35,889
hand out business cards that have their

221
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,839
PGP keys on them even though sorry guys

222
00:09:35,889 --> 00:09:40,480
I don't think I've used PGP in a good

223
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,279
five years another thing that's

224
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,820
interesting in terms of security

225
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:47,079
behavior before computers ever existed

226
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:49,690
tamper-evident locks have been around

227
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:51,760
for a really long time when it wasn't

228
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:54,040
good enough to just have a key to get in

229
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,829
or get out because we knew people could

230
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:58,930
probably break into a lock someone

231
00:09:56,829 --> 00:10:01,719
designed locks that said hey actually

232
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:04,390
someone messed with me in the 17th

233
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:06,730
century so think about that for a second

234
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:09,370
we talked a lot about you know

235
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:12,370
authentication bypasses and breaking

236
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:14,649
into things and evil made attacks but

237
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:17,680
these problems existed well before

238
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:19,779
computers did and the reason we had

239
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,000
these particular security behaviors is

240
00:10:19,779 --> 00:10:25,449
because we were trying to overcome human

241
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,790
problems with technology not the other

242
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:29,500
way around

243
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,180
another thing that I think quite a bit

244
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:36,250
about when I'm thinking about security

245
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:37,989
is these seal stones so three to five

246
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:39,970
thousand years ago when people were

247
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:42,760
still sending little bits of paper back

248
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:45,699
and forth long before we ever got into

249
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:48,399
any crypto Wars on any continent and had

250
00:10:45,699 --> 00:10:50,019
computers to worry about people were

251
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,620
sending their little bits of paper or

252
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:56,319
packages that were stamped with wax and

253
00:10:52,620 --> 00:11:00,370
the little mark on there would say hey

254
00:10:56,319 --> 00:11:02,279
this is from Sarah Sarah thank you some

255
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:03,579
nice wine here's how you know it's her

256
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:06,519
there we are

257
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:07,449
it was a form of identification and it

258
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:08,080
was a little bit of a form of

259
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:10,180
authenticate

260
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:13,330
there are also these really interesting

261
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:15,040
seal Scrolls that basically look like a

262
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:18,279
bead they're about this big when you see

263
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,980
them in a museum and you could roll one

264
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:23,800
across hot wax to get a very specific

265
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:26,140
signature it's almost like the ancient

266
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:28,000
version of that Amazon tape that they

267
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:29,620
put on all of those cardboard boxes we

268
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,810
all have to throw out the back door and

269
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:35,440
hope that the recycling man won't pick

270
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:38,349
up so if we think we have it bad with

271
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,500
fishing now if we think we have it bad

272
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:44,620
with trying to make sure that encrypted

273
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:47,050
messages are signed the right way think

274
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:49,720
about how difficult it would have been a

275
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:53,019
few hundred years ago or a few thousand

276
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,000
years ago to verify information to get

277
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:57,940
ahead of someone who's got a forgery

278
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:01,959
scheme to figure out whether something

279
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:04,540
is fake or not letters being intercepted

280
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:06,609
and open we're still a problem we're all

281
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:08,079
freaking out about that with what's

282
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,660
happening with our end-to-end encryption

283
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:13,449
and does TLS do the things we think the

284
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:17,290
TLS does or did somebody do something to

285
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:19,180
it that they shouldn't have and then

286
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,339
finally about a thousand years later

287
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,529
after the seal stones weren't doing it

288
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:25,839
anymore there's another human behavior

289
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:30,540
that popped up that's really interesting

290
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:33,610
so this this is called a letter lock and

291
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:35,680
what it does is pretty simple the person

292
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,959
who would write a letter would actually

293
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,140
end up folding it in a very specific way

294
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:44,260
that they designed to show evidence of

295
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:46,839
tampering it's a little bit like now how

296
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:49,270
when we open up signal and someone's

297
00:12:46,839 --> 00:12:52,029
security Keys changed except in this

298
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:54,699
case the security key would be looking

299
00:12:52,029 --> 00:12:56,980
at whether the wax that would make its

300
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:58,359
way down into the middle of the fold had

301
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,800
been compromised

302
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,079
whether it was grainy whether it had

303
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,760
broken that would be the evidence of

304
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:08,709
whether something's was was messed with

305
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:11,290
or not okay so we went through this

306
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:13,268
whole thing about you know what does

307
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:16,180
security look like before the computers

308
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:19,000
but the thing that's really important to

309
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:22,459
take away is we have a lot of ideas as

310
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:27,140
security people about what security

311
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:29,990
is and they are based pretty much in our

312
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:32,720
political beliefs and almost our

313
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:35,540
religious beliefs it's that serious and

314
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,370
that core of an identifying factor for

315
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:40,069
us when we move forward and we do our

316
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:42,650
work the problem with that is sometimes

317
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:45,050
we get into very big arguments about

318
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:47,449
principles and when we get into those

319
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:49,969
really big arguments about principles we

320
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:52,700
lose sight of the tiny things we need to

321
00:13:49,970 --> 00:13:55,160
be doing day to day to actually get the

322
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:58,280
job done and to actually drive

323
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,449
incremental improvement so now we have

324
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,060
to tell you how to make some friends

325
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:04,600
when some influence get some people on

326
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:07,099
our side so that's this part of the talk

327
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:10,160
one thing that's really important for

328
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:13,730
security teams to think about is where

329
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,380
power comes from there's some political

330
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:17,630
science in here there's some

331
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:19,610
anthropology in here this is all of

332
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:22,130
those classes that lots of people did

333
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:24,170
not want to take at university but a lot

334
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:26,750
of secrets into what makes your team

335
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:28,819
successful come from all of these

336
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,290
squishy human factors that everyone

337
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:32,900
likes to call soft skills

338
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:35,900
protip they are not soft they are

339
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:40,430
extremely hard to get right and very

340
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:42,949
very squishy so if we're asking you know

341
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:45,890
where power comes from as a security

342
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:47,870
team it's interesting to look at the

343
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:50,150
political world because there's a

344
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:54,590
never-ending debate about whether hard

345
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:57,439
power or soft power is what wins among

346
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:59,000
the nation states it's a question of you

347
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,390
know should we be using armies and

348
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,360
weaponry or should we be advancing

349
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:07,699
diplomacy relationships discussions and

350
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,410
scent of alignment writing policy

351
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,740
documents and wooing each other back and

352
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:15,050
forth to see if we can get to where we

353
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:17,720
need to go in our work as security

354
00:15:15,050 --> 00:15:19,760
practitioners it's not quite that messy

355
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:21,650
I don't think any of us have armies that

356
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,290
we roll out when we're about to really

357
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:28,189
go to war with the IT team if you do can

358
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:31,339
I borrow them but in our work the

359
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:33,860
question for us about power really comes

360
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:35,300
from another place and it's this are we

361
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:40,520
a team that says yes

362
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:42,709
are we a team that says no so I live in

363
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:45,079
the Silicon Valley and where I live

364
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:47,330
there are a lot of teams that take pride

365
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:50,240
in the fact that they have the ability

366
00:15:47,330 --> 00:15:52,760
to veto the release of any product that

367
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,680
comes out of their company in fact they

368
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:56,360
get really excited about this if you

369
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,280
interview with them and they start

370
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,000
talking about how security is so

371
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:04,520
important and it's such a top priority

372
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:08,960
except I don't think that's how any of

373
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:11,689
this works because if you as a team have

374
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,430
the ability to rip something right out

375
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:15,110
of the hands of hundreds of people who

376
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:18,530
have been working on it for a really

377
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:21,460
long time just because you said so five

378
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:24,560
minutes before it's going to go public

379
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:27,830
where were you when people were getting

380
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:31,280
started with this work how did you get

381
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:33,530
the ability to roll in and say no if you

382
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:36,170
didn't actually show up at the beginning

383
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:39,500
of the development process with a set of

384
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:41,959
requirements with a set of things to

385
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:44,930
watch out for with information with

386
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:47,330
resources and with all of this security

387
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:50,510
knowledge we have that can help us make

388
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:53,780
the most unbelievable creative bonkers

389
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:56,810
ideas come to life some people think

390
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:59,800
it's amazing to be able to roll in and

391
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:03,290
completely destroy you know an entire

392
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:05,780
revenue generating product stream for

393
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:07,430
two quarters just because they're really

394
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:10,160
not excited about the way somebody

395
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:12,920
rotated a key somewhere never mind

396
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,910
that the key in question is a relatively

397
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:19,610
low-risk asset and development roadmap

398
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:22,850
is gonna have that ripped out within six

399
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:24,199
months of the product shipping something

400
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:26,089
that's really important to think about

401
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:29,630
here is this you know security teams

402
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:31,970
wonder when they're the team of know why

403
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:34,190
no one wants to come and hang out why

404
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:36,230
they have difficulty getting traction

405
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:38,410
within their organizations and the

406
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:40,400
answer is kind of simple in fact

407
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:44,900
something you can learn by playing with

408
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:47,420
LEGOs if you are the team that comes in

409
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:48,540
and you literally take everyone's toys

410
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:50,190
away or

411
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:53,250
tell them that they are playing with

412
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:57,600
their toys wrong or that thing they made

413
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:59,280
for fun is total crap of course they're

414
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,679
not going to want to hang out with you

415
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:04,290
of course they are not going to want to

416
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:06,480
listen to you of course they are not

417
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:09,120
going to share their Legos with you and

418
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:13,500
I don't know what you guys but it sucks

419
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:16,580
to not be part of a Lego party so on

420
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:19,170
another scale we have the issue of our

421
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:22,320
profession globally just not being

422
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:25,140
successful if you look at the

423
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,870
conversations we have and our beloved

424
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:30,360
InfoSec water-cooler named Twitter they

425
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:33,209
look a little something like this more

426
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:36,600
often than not and there's a lot of

427
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:39,210
arguing that comes from this place of

428
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:43,080
security teams thinking to be successful

429
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:45,510
they need to be in control they need to

430
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,149
be playing politics they need to be

431
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:50,490
jockeying for power the problem with

432
00:18:48,150 --> 00:18:53,100
that for anyone who spent way too much

433
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:56,280
time in European history is that

434
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:59,969
eventually absolute power unchecked

435
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:03,149
power ends up being a really toxic hell

436
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:04,470
still it ends up creating an environment

437
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:08,010
where you don't have psychological

438
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:10,680
safety for your team for your colleagues

439
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:13,200
for your ideas and you don't feel like

440
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:15,900
you can speak up or you can actually

441
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:19,170
advocate for the things that will make a

442
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:22,140
real difference no one succeeds in that

443
00:19:19,170 --> 00:19:24,540
environment not on a community level not

444
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:27,180
on a team level and most definitely not

445
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:29,909
an industry level if you've ever worked

446
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:32,100
for a team whose enforcement mechanisms

447
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:33,870
were a bunch of policies that were

448
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:38,189
locked away in a drawer that no one had

449
00:19:33,870 --> 00:19:41,070
access to you've experienced this very

450
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:43,800
very specific exquisite form of pain and

451
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:46,290
it stinks because it's a total double

452
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:49,020
standard security teams can scream all

453
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:51,960
day long about transparency and doing

454
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:54,180
all of this wonderful stuff but then

455
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:56,820
when someone wants to come back and

456
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:59,490
audit they use the control they have and

457
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,260
saying no you can't question us that's

458
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:02,660
not cool

459
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:06,020
especially when most of the time the

460
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:07,640
security team already has visibility

461
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,889
into everything inside of an

462
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,800
organization but they can't even turn

463
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:14,570
around and share their thinking because

464
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,850
they don't want to be questioned and

465
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:20,450
don't want to give away Legos or share

466
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:22,550
them with anyone else if we want to make

467
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,830
friends we're gonna have to learn how to

468
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:27,139
play together nicely with others if we

469
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:29,629
don't want regulators walking in and

470
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:31,250
taking our toys away forever we're gonna

471
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:33,350
have to not only learn how to play nice

472
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:35,480
we're gonna have to learn how to take

473
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:37,370
care of our toys better at the end of

474
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:39,920
the day as a security team it is up to

475
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:43,370
us to define our charter to define our

476
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:45,920
identity and to decide who we want to be

477
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:49,070
as individuals and if we approach others

478
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:52,100
from a place of control and we have a

479
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:55,040
top-down authoritarian point of view we

480
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:56,870
are not going to get anything done which

481
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:01,100
is basically something that we say play

482
00:20:56,870 --> 00:21:03,560
out day to day in our own sphere so

483
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:05,270
another thing that you can do especially

484
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,169
if you don't want to be a control minded

485
00:21:05,270 --> 00:21:11,330
organization switch your charter

486
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:13,400
security should be about empowerment it

487
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:16,879
should be about finding the right way to

488
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:20,350
say yes it should be about helping

489
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:24,560
people make impossible crazy creative

490
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:29,570
bonkers ideas become a reality in a safe

491
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:32,000
way one way that you can do this as a

492
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:34,280
practitioner is to think about your team

493
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:38,270
Charter and find ways to provide

494
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:40,820
expertise and consulting to other teams

495
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:43,070
in your organization but you can also

496
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:46,639
think about how to focus very

497
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:49,280
specifically on your user we all spend a

498
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,470
lot of time at conferences reading

499
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,870
papers going through presentations

500
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:57,830
thinking about attackers we think about

501
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:59,570
attackers all day long however the vast

502
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:01,879
majority of the security incidents we

503
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:03,620
have to clean up aren't because some

504
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,380
teenagers somewhere hacked a mainframe

505
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:09,610
they're most likely because somebody

506
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:11,780
didn't go through a training someone

507
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:14,719
misconfigured something someone

508
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:17,780
a setting that was really important got

509
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:21,680
hidden in a menu that no one ever looked

510
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:23,870
at or quite frankly we just forgot

511
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:26,090
because the process broke somewhere and

512
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:28,129
no one ever reviewed it and figured out

513
00:22:26,090 --> 00:22:30,560
whether the right things were happening

514
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:35,720
to control a particular part of business

515
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:37,790
risk so there's another thing that can

516
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,070
help become help you become more of a

517
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:42,200
sort of service organization there's a

518
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:44,179
really common assumption that security

519
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:46,940
teams are supposed to know everything

520
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:50,870
now I don't know about you guys and gals

521
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:52,880
but I don't anything mostly because of

522
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:54,860
the Socrates guy and his friends

523
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,570
Aristotle and all those other smart

524
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:57,830
people who are just like yeah don't

525
00:22:56,570 --> 00:23:00,620
bother you're never gonna learn

526
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:03,080
everything just put yourself in a place

527
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:06,469
where you are constantly willing to

528
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:09,050
learn and maybe once in a while relearn

529
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:11,260
all of the stuff that you forgot that

530
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:13,460
usually happens on a 10-year cycle

531
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:15,650
something that tends to happen with

532
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:18,200
security teams more often than not these

533
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:20,930
days is they walk into the room and they

534
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:22,700
think that it is their job to be the

535
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:24,830
smartest people there and to show off

536
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:27,770
that they know more than everyone else

537
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:29,210
this is a huge problem because nobody

538
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:32,150
wants to be friends with a know-it-all

539
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:34,280
it's nice to know lots of stuff it's not

540
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:36,920
nice when you demonstrate that knowledge

541
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:39,560
in a way that makes people feel dumb and

542
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:43,340
it makes them not want to work with you

543
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:44,840
as a service organization to be security

544
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:47,240
minded we should actually take a

545
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:50,659
Socratic approach we should be asking

546
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:52,490
questions we should be investigating we

547
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:55,940
should be discovering we should be

548
00:23:52,490 --> 00:23:58,580
learning with our teams but not doing

549
00:23:55,940 --> 00:24:01,490
things for them as if you know we are

550
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:04,669
the maid or we are the janitor and we

551
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:07,880
are always there to clean up we should

552
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:11,000
be step and step with our team's not

553
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:13,640
behind them not sneaking off in a corner

554
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,800
saying ugly things about them it's up to

555
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:18,200
us if our colleagues are actually repeat

556
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:20,389
customers of our organization it's up to

557
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,670
us if we make people feel bad for

558
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:24,760
clicking on a link or installing the

559
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:26,559
malware because if we make them feel bad

560
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:29,049
they don't come back and tell us when

561
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:30,940
they did it by accident again they just

562
00:24:29,049 --> 00:24:33,280
hide it and we have much bigger problems

563
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:37,750
that we have to figure out that are much

564
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:39,190
more costly another way to be a little

565
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:42,820
bit more of a service minded

566
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:45,549
organization is to think about how we

567
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:48,460
educate others I don't know about any of

568
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:51,129
you but I hate to be told you cannot

569
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:53,890
tell me what to do you must politely

570
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:54,970
suggest in the right way it doesn't make

571
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:56,980
it sound like you're bossing me around

572
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,780
like my mom did or you're gonna be in

573
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:01,020
trouble

574
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:03,190
possibly a personal leadership flaw but

575
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:06,760
practically everyone I work with is the

576
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:09,880
same way so what that means for me as an

577
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:11,980
individual on my team is that I had to

578
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:15,250
start educating and seeding ideas with

579
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:17,200
people it's one thing if it's time for

580
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:17,919
us to institute a secure development

581
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,380
lifecycle

582
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,540
and I walk into a meeting with my

583
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:25,270
developers and say okay guys you're

584
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:28,570
doing this now it's another thing if I

585
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:31,330
let my junior developers experience the

586
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:34,780
frustration of having to find patch

587
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:36,370
triage manage bugs or sweep up a few

588
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:41,168
things on the bug bounty program and

589
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:43,449
they come to me and they say hey wait we

590
00:25:41,169 --> 00:25:45,280
keep finding all of these bugs and we

591
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:49,480
wanted to write all of this automation

592
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:52,418
to find bugs but isn't it smarter if we

593
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,070
just don't make bugs at all usually the

594
00:25:52,419 --> 00:25:56,160
young developers like yeah let's just

595
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:59,470
throw the computers in the ocean now

596
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:01,690
doesn't work that way unfortunately but

597
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:04,630
instead of coming to them and telling

598
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:06,669
them what to do I can say okay well this

599
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:08,950
is how we stop bugs from happening

600
00:26:06,669 --> 00:26:10,510
before they start this is what you need

601
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:12,309
to know about the language you're using

602
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:14,890
this is what you need to know about

603
00:26:12,309 --> 00:26:16,360
sanitizing inputs these are the three or

604
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:19,750
four things you can think about in the

605
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:22,479
next month and if you don't have any

606
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:24,220
bugs and these particular classes not

607
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,250
only will I give you more money we are

608
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:28,809
going to have a fantastic party with

609
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:32,530
what we didn't spend on bug bounty

610
00:26:28,809 --> 00:26:35,230
budget silly stuff but at the end of the

611
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:36,879
day instead of telling my teams what to

612
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:39,399
do and bossing them around

613
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,639
I can lead them where they need to go

614
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:45,129
and let them figure things out it is a

615
00:26:42,639 --> 00:26:46,990
much better spot to be in if we are

616
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:49,360
service minded and we are coaching

617
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:51,220
people through solving problems and

618
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,360
giving them the critical skills that

619
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:54,669
they need for thinking and

620
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,350
problem-solving rather than just

621
00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:58,809
dragging them through giving them

622
00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:05,649
checklists and forcing them to do what

623
00:26:58,809 --> 00:27:06,970
we say no one likes that so another

624
00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:10,268
thing that's really important is

625
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:12,940
knowledge sharing there's something that

626
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:14,919
went on in my organization that was a

627
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:18,730
surprising gift and something that I'm

628
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:20,830
extremely proud of in my organization I

629
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:23,919
was the first security hire I have a

630
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:27,850
bunch of security minded developers but

631
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:30,490
I had seven audits over a year-long

632
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:33,759
period because we were about to launch

633
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:35,799
some pretty critical code and all of my

634
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:38,980
audits were looking at different layers

635
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:40,899
of my code but instead of doing what I

636
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:43,809
had experienced in other security teams

637
00:27:40,899 --> 00:27:45,959
which was sitting in the corner running

638
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:48,750
the audits never talking to developers

639
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:51,610
never making them part of the process I

640
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:53,950
decided I was gonna step back and I was

641
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:57,158
going to be the quietest person and the

642
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:59,320
whole security audit I grabbed my

643
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:02,620
developers and said guys we have kickoff

644
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:05,320
call let's go I've already scoped this I

645
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:07,600
have already taken care of all of the

646
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:10,480
administrative work here's how the

647
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:13,509
process of the audit is going to go but

648
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,090
show up for the kickoff calls show up

649
00:28:13,509 --> 00:28:18,039
for the weekly syncs come and talk to

650
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:22,299
the people who are evaluating your code

651
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:23,710
and see what this is really about so I

652
00:28:22,299 --> 00:28:25,658
thought this might be a little bit of a

653
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:28,929
drag because security auditor is

654
00:28:25,659 --> 00:28:31,029
expensive hourly oh my gosh I don't even

655
00:28:28,929 --> 00:28:34,750
want to know how much money I spent but

656
00:28:31,029 --> 00:28:37,779
my developers were able to actually be

657
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:39,129
part of a process that previously had

658
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:41,559
scared the crap out of them

659
00:28:39,129 --> 00:28:44,918
instead of arguing with me about how

660
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:47,559
dumb documentation was they were able to

661
00:28:44,919 --> 00:28:50,440
see that auditors needed documentation

662
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:53,620
because they needed to have some

663
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:56,800
of information to help them know how the

664
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:59,979
codes supposed to work once my

665
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:02,830
developers saw documentation as a trust

666
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:05,500
problem an integrity problem and a

667
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:07,810
security problem my documentation got to

668
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:11,200
be a million times better to the point

669
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:14,110
that I actually got compliments on it

670
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:16,990
around audit 5 or audit 6 of the process

671
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:19,449
because my teams were actually motivated

672
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:21,970
to do that work themselves instead of me

673
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:24,330
running along and yelling at them to go

674
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:26,680
write some more and do their homework

675
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:30,460
another thing that helped us out quite a

676
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:32,650
bit too was that I was able to basically

677
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:34,180
get my teams to start thinking about

678
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:36,760
threat modeling and architecture

679
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:40,480
diagramming it's one thing if I have to

680
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:42,580
try to attend every single meeting in my

681
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,250
organization when someone's talking

682
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:48,669
about designing a thing it's another if

683
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:51,520
I can scale myself if I can create

684
00:29:48,670 --> 00:29:55,600
education opportunities and I can

685
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:58,660
actually give them ways to lead their

686
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,340
own work identify their own risk and

687
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:02,620
then come to me when they need a little

688
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,480
bit of proofreading rather than when

689
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:06,699
they need me to come and lead every

690
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,540
single thing and be a single point of

691
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:11,770
failure in all of our processes the

692
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:13,149
other thing that was great is that

693
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:15,010
instead of having a bunch of developers

694
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:18,010
who are mad they had to show up for a

695
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:21,640
6:00 a.m. call I had a whole bunch more

696
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:25,120
allies no one actually knew how security

697
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:27,250
audits worked so the whole process was

698
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:30,010
less scary we ended up having really

699
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:32,980
great engineering conversations instead

700
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:35,080
of having political warfare over someone

701
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:38,170
asking why did you code this way as if

702
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:40,500
you were not wearing pants which comes

703
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:42,430
up in an in a review once in a while and

704
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:45,250
it was nice to be able to give a

705
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:46,600
behind-the-scenes look at why things

706
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:49,630
have to be done

707
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:50,350
a specific way instead of demanding for

708
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:52,870
my team

709
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:56,290
they must execute on this thousand step

710
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:58,330
fan dance just right they could see what

711
00:30:56,290 --> 00:31:01,629
was important what wasn't important and

712
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:03,100
they were able to adjust the way that

713
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:04,330
they performed

714
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,879
and they actually became more

715
00:31:04,330 --> 00:31:08,500
accountable at the end of the day to

716
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:14,260
explaining why they made specific

717
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:15,760
decisions and they wrote better tests so

718
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:17,110
there's another thing if you want to win

719
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,510
friends and influence people that's

720
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:22,299
really important you have to put your

721
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:24,610
best face forward I don't mean this is

722
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:28,210
hygiene advice I actually mean that's

723
00:31:24,610 --> 00:31:30,909
not a very practical no security

724
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:34,110
practitioners we are compelled to be

725
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:37,960
transparent we will explain how

726
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:39,879
something works to the nth degree to the

727
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:42,190
point that if we are talking to

728
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:45,070
non-technical folks we might

729
00:31:42,190 --> 00:31:47,250
accidentally tell them everything wrong

730
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:49,960
with what we are asking them to do

731
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:53,169
before they actually get a chance to do

732
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:55,570
it the best place to think about this is

733
00:31:53,169 --> 00:31:58,990
how we have discussions about two-factor

734
00:31:55,570 --> 00:32:02,500
authentication we have Wars about

735
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:04,919
password managers but we have some ugly

736
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:08,860
battles over two-factor authentication

737
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:12,250
the problem is that some two-factor

738
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:14,740
authentication is better than none for

739
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:18,370
the vast majority of people those people

740
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:20,289
generally aren't us so when we start to

741
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:23,739
talk to users about you know how to

742
00:32:20,289 --> 00:32:25,270
protect themselves we will tell them you

743
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:27,970
know you should use two-factor

744
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:29,740
authentication but oh the one that's

745
00:32:27,970 --> 00:32:31,510
most prevalent everywhere on the

746
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:33,220
Internet the one that sends you a text

747
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:35,530
message that's crap

748
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:38,409
actually let me tell you everything

749
00:32:35,530 --> 00:32:40,629
wrong with it let me take away every

750
00:32:38,409 --> 00:32:43,600
good reason you might have to change

751
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:46,150
your behavior and do something that

752
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:49,110
provides an incremental improvement to

753
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:51,730
your personal security or to our

754
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:54,010
organizational security let me just tell

755
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:55,330
you all the warts and then leave you so

756
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:58,000
confused that you don't know what to do

757
00:32:55,330 --> 00:33:01,149
so you don't do anything at all as

758
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,490
practitioners we have to do better than

759
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:06,520
that because when we remove people's

760
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:09,309
incentive to change behavior that we

761
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:13,330
really need to see changed

762
00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:16,610
we basically stab ourselves right in the

763
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:18,500
heart as teams also we have to

764
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:20,570
put our best face forward because if we

765
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:24,110
don't talk about our successes and the

766
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:26,450
stuff that we get to do well nobody else

767
00:33:24,110 --> 00:33:28,729
is going to do it we can't just be the

768
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:30,620
team that's grumpy that is overly

769
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:32,870
political that doesn't get invited to

770
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:35,239
play with Legos or to go to parties

771
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:38,419
because we tell too many gloom and doom

772
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:41,030
tales more than any other job security

773
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:43,040
requires us to convince people to change

774
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:45,830
their behavior if we're always good at

775
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,270
social engineering as we see we are we

776
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:50,899
would have already gotten all of this

777
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:52,850
done another thing that's really

778
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:55,580
important is to make sure we're

779
00:33:52,850 --> 00:33:59,918
marketing our work lots of security

780
00:33:55,580 --> 00:34:03,428
folks hate marketing sorry guys and gals

781
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:06,500
security is a marketing job fight me

782
00:34:03,429 --> 00:34:09,639
marketing teams define identity they

783
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:11,960
have to do all kinds of things that look

784
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:14,780
really really close to monitoring

785
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:17,510
alerting detection threat intelligence

786
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:20,720
they just have to do it differently

787
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:23,869
marketing teams also have to understand

788
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:26,149
people how people pay attention if

789
00:34:23,869 --> 00:34:27,800
people pay attention what they're likely

790
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:31,549
to read what they're not going to read

791
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:34,520
and generally how to get attention and

792
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:37,550
to get people to show up we could use

793
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:39,710
some help on that front definitely some

794
00:34:37,550 --> 00:34:41,300
days we have to be better salesman and

795
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:44,899
sales women for the services that we

796
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:47,270
provide our organizations and we have to

797
00:34:44,899 --> 00:34:49,460
make sure that when we are successful at

798
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:51,469
something or we can provide improvement

799
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:54,500
or we can bring something important to

800
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:56,779
the table we have that as our talking

801
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:59,480
points and we stick to them we nail them

802
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:02,570
when we repeat ourselves in the places

803
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:05,540
where we are successful it's not us just

804
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:08,090
boasting repetition is key to helping

805
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:10,820
people learn and key to helping people

806
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:12,920
remember another thing the marketing

807
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:14,540
team will teach you is you have to be

808
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:17,300
really cognizant of your audience and

809
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:19,520
what's gonna work for them most people's

810
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:23,540
attention spans are shorter than ever I

811
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:25,850
think right now if after about 11

812
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:28,759
seconds if the YouTube video isn't

813
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:29,759
entertaining enough people just skip on

814
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,670
to the next

815
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:34,800
one if you only have 11 seconds of

816
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:37,680
someone's attention span if you only

817
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,170
have 11 seconds to get one thing about

818
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,720
your work to your non-technical user or

819
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:45,630
to your development team how are you

820
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:47,339
gonna use it first off you can't bury

821
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:49,320
the lead in any of your security

822
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:52,230
communications you have to be clear you

823
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:54,060
have to be concise go ask your marketing

824
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:56,790
call your marketing team about what a

825
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:58,529
good call-to-action looks like you have

826
00:35:56,790 --> 00:35:59,460
to remember no one's gonna read a giant

827
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:02,400
wall of text

828
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:05,340
there's a reason bullet points bolding

829
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:08,460
things italicizing things lots of arrows

830
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:11,820
and emojis and funding where you need

831
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:13,290
attention are what marketers do when

832
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:15,240
they are trying to part us from our

833
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:19,380
money which they're very good at by the

834
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:21,120
way another thing to remember if we're

835
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:24,570
trying to market our work and we are

836
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:27,450
trying to make people aware that we can

837
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:28,500
be good colleagues and collaborators we

838
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:30,779
have to remember that humor can be

839
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:32,520
really powerful people will remember

840
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,810
when you make them laugh they will make

841
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:36,330
you remember when you make them feel

842
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:38,940
good and when you've made them feel like

843
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:40,980
they make a huge difference and knowing

844
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:43,890
how to help people connect especially

845
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:46,830
over food with brown-bag lunch with

846
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:48,810
education opportunities with silly games

847
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:51,390
with throwing styrofoam balls at each

848
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:53,900
other just because it's a Friday that

849
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:57,420
makes a huge difference and then finally

850
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:59,490
if we really want to win more friends

851
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:03,330
and we really want to influence people

852
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:06,600
we have to completely just reject most

853
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:09,240
of the status quo around us I mentioned

854
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:11,460
earlier my job is the butt of a few

855
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:13,290
jokes because I work in blockchain land

856
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:14,250
if you have blockchain jokes I don't

857
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:17,100
want to hear them I've heard them all

858
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:19,290
already here's the thing about a decade

859
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:23,100
ago when I started working in technology

860
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:27,390
I remember when the cloud was the butt

861
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:30,960
of everyone's jokes except I don't know

862
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:33,569
about you guys I just looked at amazon's

863
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,160
market cap for their web services we

864
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:38,160
didn't criticize the cloud out of

865
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,870
existence the market spoke the market

866
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,580
keeps giving them more and more and more

867
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:43,290
money I'm not saying that these

868
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,558
blockchain kids are the cloud I don't

869
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:45,390
know

870
00:37:43,559 --> 00:37:47,519
what to do with these things I just know

871
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:50,759
how to protect people from them but what

872
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:54,180
I think is that if we just keep

873
00:37:50,759 --> 00:37:56,519
persisting in this behavior where we try

874
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:58,799
to criticize things out of existence not

875
00:37:56,519 --> 00:38:01,198
only are we not going to get anywhere

876
00:37:58,799 --> 00:38:04,380
we're certainly not going to solve any

877
00:38:01,199 --> 00:38:05,969
of the shadow IT problems we have and no

878
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:07,650
one's going to listen to us when we're

879
00:38:05,969 --> 00:38:10,109
all running around with our hair on fire

880
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:13,619
at the next thing that someone just

881
00:38:10,109 --> 00:38:15,328
slapped Internet connectivity into the

882
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:18,380
main reason we should really be burning

883
00:38:15,329 --> 00:38:21,449
down our isolationist security team

884
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:24,180
mindset is this there are seven billion

885
00:38:21,449 --> 00:38:25,199
human beings on this planet and many of

886
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,868
those people don't have the same

887
00:38:25,199 --> 00:38:30,660
education experiences or access to the

888
00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:33,809
Internet that we do we are never ever

889
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:35,848
going to get ahead of all of them and if

890
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:37,920
we can't beat them we should probably at

891
00:38:35,849 --> 00:38:40,049
least try to get them to join us we

892
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,420
can't afford to make any more enemies

893
00:38:40,049 --> 00:38:45,150
and we can't afford to alienate more

894
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:47,099
people as teams we should always be

895
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:48,929
recruiting we should be trying to

896
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:51,089
distribute our workload we should be

897
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:53,130
trying to make sure that security is

898
00:38:51,089 --> 00:38:55,769
synonymous with productivity and not

899
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:57,749
slowing things down the secure way to do

900
00:38:55,769 --> 00:39:01,288
something should be the only productive

901
00:38:57,749 --> 00:39:02,999
way to do something period and we really

902
00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:05,219
have to make sure that other people

903
00:39:02,999 --> 00:39:07,049
around us understand that the blue team

904
00:39:05,219 --> 00:39:09,359
isn't just a bunch of engineers who are

905
00:39:07,049 --> 00:39:11,939
grepping through code and doing fancy

906
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:15,538
things on github by the way those new

907
00:39:11,939 --> 00:39:17,328
security advisories are amazing but we

908
00:39:15,539 --> 00:39:19,559
should work to be violently

909
00:39:17,329 --> 00:39:23,729
cross-functional with marketing with

910
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:27,140
legal with HR with anybody else who

911
00:39:23,729 --> 00:39:30,718
might be able to help us do our main job

912
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:33,839
which is to remove fear remove

913
00:39:30,719 --> 00:39:35,819
uncertainty remove doubt and I don't

914
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:41,900
know help people use stuff better and

915
00:39:35,819 --> 00:39:41,900
keep people from getting hurt finally

916
00:39:42,109 --> 00:39:48,900
I'm borrowing the conference theme a

917
00:39:45,539 --> 00:39:50,519
little bit but it is really dangerous to

918
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:53,400
be a security team or a security

919
00:39:50,519 --> 00:39:55,618
practitioner who is out there working by

920
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,079
yourself to accomplish things on your

921
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:58,269
own

922
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,369
the concept of being a single point of

923
00:39:58,269 --> 00:40:03,578
failure is part of our core principles

924
00:40:00,369 --> 00:40:05,679
for a reason and too many awful people

925
00:40:03,579 --> 00:40:09,729
win when we're at war with one another

926
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:11,140
and that's not great the toxic community

927
00:40:09,729 --> 00:40:13,419
and the industry and fighting that we

928
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:15,038
have doesn't get us anywhere it just

929
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:18,189
makes the criminals more successful and

930
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:20,739
the people who want us to not win get a

931
00:40:18,189 --> 00:40:23,469
few more steps ahead of us our jobs

932
00:40:20,739 --> 00:40:26,439
already hard enough anyway and lots of

933
00:40:23,469 --> 00:40:29,979
us want to actually fix things we're not

934
00:40:26,439 --> 00:40:33,759
quite sure how the price for all of this

935
00:40:29,979 --> 00:40:37,660
is working out we don't know if security

936
00:40:33,759 --> 00:40:38,140
problems are directly leading to people

937
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:41,259
dying

938
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:43,929
we have no idea but kind of feels like

939
00:40:41,259 --> 00:40:45,640
we're not far from that and that's not a

940
00:40:43,929 --> 00:40:49,019
reality that I think any of us want to

941
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:52,209
have to wake up with one day and say

942
00:40:49,019 --> 00:40:53,678
crap it really should have been nicer to

943
00:40:52,209 --> 00:40:56,469
those other guys on the other side of

944
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:59,650
the building we have to have resiliency

945
00:40:56,469 --> 00:41:01,869
we have to be able to recover when the

946
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:04,749
going gets tough and we have to make

947
00:41:01,869 --> 00:41:06,900
sure we have other resources to back us

948
00:41:04,749 --> 00:41:10,269
up when we need them the most

949
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:12,339
finally I have a couple of things I

950
00:41:10,269 --> 00:41:14,859
always love to say but I will not read

951
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:17,219
them word to word for you generally

952
00:41:14,859 --> 00:41:20,319
though we can't afford to isolate anyone

953
00:41:17,219 --> 00:41:23,259
whether there are teams whether they are

954
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:25,058
marketers journalists people who use

955
00:41:23,259 --> 00:41:27,819
technology people who want to throw

956
00:41:25,059 --> 00:41:29,619
technology into the ocean we have to

957
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:32,619
figure out how to get along with

958
00:41:29,619 --> 00:41:35,469
everyone and we have to be more

959
00:41:32,619 --> 00:41:38,259
compatible with all kinds of people

960
00:41:35,469 --> 00:41:39,880
coming from all kinds of places it's the

961
00:41:38,259 --> 00:41:42,549
only way we're going to get people

962
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:45,219
paying attention to the software we use

963
00:41:42,549 --> 00:41:47,559
and the behaviors that we need to see

964
00:41:45,219 --> 00:41:49,719
them practice no one's gonna want to

965
00:41:47,559 --> 00:41:51,849
hang out with you as a security team if

966
00:41:49,719 --> 00:41:54,969
they've found out you've been talking

967
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:57,969
crap about them if your users suspect

968
00:41:54,969 --> 00:42:00,369
that you think they're dumb they'll

969
00:41:57,969 --> 00:42:02,140
figure it out quickly if your users

970
00:42:00,369 --> 00:42:03,339
think that you don't care about them the

971
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:05,739
first place they're gonna figure that

972
00:42:03,339 --> 00:42:09,210
out is how well you maintain your

973
00:42:05,739 --> 00:42:10,860
documentation and how you treat them

974
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:13,710
something breaks or when an incident

975
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:15,420
happens speaking poorly of the people

976
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:17,670
who we are supposed to be protecting and

977
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:20,660
defending doesn't make us better and it

978
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:24,030
doesn't make them safer and then finally

979
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:25,770
I guess the real point of all of this

980
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:28,290
talking I've been doing is pretty simple

981
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:30,230
we have to change what we are doing as

982
00:42:28,290 --> 00:42:33,000
an industry to be well-rounded

983
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:34,770
well-informed and much more emotionally

984
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,840
intelligent than we actually are

985
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:38,790
dare I say we probably have to figure

986
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:42,180
out what that empathy thing is if we

987
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:43,529
haven't done it already we need to be

988
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:46,770
able to embrace people from all over the

989
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:49,410
place we have to recruit for diversity

990
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:53,070
of experience for curiosity and we have

991
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:55,230
to find people who want to do lifelong

992
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:56,760
learning and who aren't exhausted every

993
00:42:55,230 --> 00:42:59,310
time they have to go pick up a new

994
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:01,260
language or a new tool or you know

995
00:42:59,310 --> 00:43:03,299
figure out what the hell OS query did

996
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:06,000
the last time that it through a weird

997
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:08,760
alert we have to stop digging our

998
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,040
collective feet in the sand code can be

999
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:13,710
learned we don't have to make everyone

1000
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,180
be a computer scientist when I was in

1001
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:16,920
college I looked at what they were

1002
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:20,040
trying to teach me and said no this is

1003
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:22,830
crap no one's going to actually be using

1004
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:26,220
this by the time I go work in technology

1005
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:29,069
I wasn't wrong so I would like to summon

1006
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:30,810
18 year old me back and find out what

1007
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:33,600
other what brilliant things she had

1008
00:43:30,810 --> 00:43:35,400
going on in her brain but the technology

1009
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:38,040
that I work on didn't exist a decade ago

1010
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:40,830
the language that we use to write it go

1011
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:42,180
maybe seven or eight years old wasn't

1012
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:45,180
around when I was in university either

1013
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:46,649
I'm not a good engineer because I went

1014
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:49,230
to college and learned it I'm a good

1015
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:51,210
engineer because I know I don't know

1016
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:53,490
everything but I'm willing to at least

1017
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:56,490
try to figure it out and I want to be

1018
00:43:53,490 --> 00:44:01,709
surrounded with people like me who will

1019
00:43:56,490 --> 00:44:03,629
do the same thing thank you very much

1020
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:06,240
for listening to me rant until lots and

1021
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:09,180
lots of security stories

1022
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:11,750
[Applause]

1023
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,750
yep

1024
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:15,690
Thank You Jessie a wonderful call to

1025
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,980
arms therefore people are inspired by

1026
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:19,500
what you say and they want to go back to

1027
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:20,220
their workplaces not tomorrow that same

1028
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:23,490
Monday

1029
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:25,799
and implement what a three short sharp

1030
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:27,029
bits of advice people can do real things

1031
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,610
they can do to move towards those goals

1032
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:33,150
that you're nice so there's a few

1033
00:44:29,610 --> 00:44:35,850
different things for one start looking

1034
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:38,040
for ways that you can partner with other

1035
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:39,330
teams and you can use projects that

1036
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:41,910
they're working on to drive your

1037
00:44:39,330 --> 00:44:44,460
security goals you can throw out your

1038
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:46,410
security roadmap and say okay never let

1039
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:49,320
a good crisis go to wait there are two

1040
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:52,529
crises where we can make this one thing

1041
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:55,170
we want to do happen much faster than we

1042
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:57,780
even planned on another thing we can do

1043
00:44:55,170 --> 00:45:00,720
is to make sure that we are fun and

1044
00:44:57,780 --> 00:45:02,160
welcoming and inviting having snacks in

1045
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,439
your corner is actually a good thing

1046
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:07,200
because people get hungry people forget

1047
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:09,840
their lunch and people really really

1048
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,939
really like chocolate or beef jerky and

1049
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:13,830
then finally just thinking about how we

1050
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:15,780
talk to other people and making sure

1051
00:45:13,830 --> 00:45:17,640
that we are using inclusive language

1052
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:19,830
we're not using jargon when we're

1053
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:21,779
talking to you know an administrative

1054
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:25,020
assistant we are explaining things in

1055
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:26,880
very human terms people's eyeballs glaze

1056
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:28,950
over when we start talking about

1057
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,680
encryption and all of these protocols

1058
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:33,299
and the alphabet soup of technology we

1059
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,069
got to do better and at least give them

1060
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:37,170
something tangible to work with

1061
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:38,730
chocolate or beef jerky that's my

1062
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:40,830
takeaway there give her a round of

1063
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:42,750
applause grab your little Zelda chess

1064
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:43,020
set on the way Jesse great start thank

1065
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:47,059
you

1066
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:47,059
[Applause]
