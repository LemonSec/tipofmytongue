1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:03,090
afternoon we've got some Tennessee

2
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:04,920
Laurinburg from the Bureau of

3
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,620
Meteorology basically trying to show us

4
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,420
tell us how to actually get your devs to

5
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,460
develop secure soft when you don't

6
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:12,809
really have support for it just as a

7
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:15,630
reminder make sure you phones are on

8
00:00:12,809 --> 00:00:17,580
silent or off and you do use the other

9
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,990
app to actually rate the speakers and

10
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:20,880
the sessions so they've got feedback for

11
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:26,729
a few cheers anyway please welcome

12
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:29,519
Tennessee good afternoon everyone

13
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:32,340
so yes this is me this is my tight mark

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,129
my talk title I'm on Twitter go for it

15
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,440
it's fair game and I've got a background

16
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,870
as a software developer and one of the

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,140
things that I've definitely run across

18
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:45,629
is tried to build builds support in an

19
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,670
organization team or other context for

20
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,379
getting security into that software

21
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,539
lifecycle so these are some of my worst

22
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,039
slides but some of my best content so I

23
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:54,390
was editing right up till the last

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,340
minute because I poured all of my

25
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,449
thoughts in but I didn't format them

26
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,160
beautifully if I could send the

27
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:01,649
information back oh it's in this

28
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,510
presentation and the lotto numbers okay

29
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:04,470
so I don't have all the answers those of

30
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:06,210
you who've worked with me will

31
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,610
definitely know that's true now all the

32
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,100
rest of you also know it nothing is easy

33
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:12,590
and only some things work out but I have

34
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:15,000
opinions and here we are

35
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:17,130
disclaimer I'm not here to represent my

36
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,229
employer anyone else's employer any

37
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:21,360
formal organization or anything other

38
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:23,880
than just my collection of thoughts it's

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,400
about people and it's about us here in

40
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,649
this room so about me so I was a junior

41
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,509
developer then I was a developer then I

42
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,950
was more developing and then I got

43
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:33,689
distracted by machine learning but I

44
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,970
still had a day job as a developer and

45
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:37,770
then suddenly a sharp turn to the right

46
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:40,259
and I went into a super computing team

47
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:42,298
and then I was equally sharp turn to the

48
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,770
left into secure coding and now I'm

49
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,860
currently doing cyber security

50
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:49,759
engineering at the weather bureau okay

51
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:53,539
so the science is in for how to do this

52
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:56,070
exercise and eat healthily wait no sorry

53
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:57,810
actually fix problems and patch

54
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:00,089
regularly sorry it's very similar

55
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:02,430
concepts so why might some of us not

56
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,770
actually fix problems or actually patch

57
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:06,299
regularly or for that matter why might

58
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,860
we not all exercise and eat healthfully

59
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:11,069
given that it's obviously the answer

60
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:12,629
also you should do see ICD sector pops

61
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:13,649
and agile but saying that can make

62
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:15,780
people angry

63
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:18,329
so let's talk about achievements what

64
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,700
what does success look like in securing

65
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:22,709
the software lifecycle let me talk about

66
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,760
just some people who I've seen around

67
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:25,739
the place here there and everywhere

68
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,750
who've gone out and achieved something

69
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:29,370
in an organization I'm like yeah you you

70
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,569
really went and you made some kind of

71
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,019
difference you made a dent in the

72
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:36,089
universe so one of the people out here

73
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:38,459
built the keep the CTF and they did it

74
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:40,439
themselves they went oh I think I might

75
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:42,120
quite like to do that and they went out

76
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:43,560
and they bought several train kits and

77
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,269
they glued the whole thing together and

78
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,739
they stayed up late at night and they

79
00:02:45,269 --> 00:02:48,150
just went out into it and I'm willing to

80
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:50,549
bet that that's not because their boss

81
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:53,129
said hey have I got a job for you it's

82
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:55,950
because they did it themselves saw

83
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:57,840
someone go take a legacy application

84
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,929
that had absolutely no test coverage and

85
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,730
force the organization every developer

86
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:04,769
all of the people around the developers

87
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:07,048
the project manager and everyone else on

88
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:09,150
the project to go and cure three months

89
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:10,980
delay and get that thing up to 80% test

90
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:12,480
coverage I've actually seen it done I

91
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:16,018
still don't really know how you pulled

92
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,698
it off establishing a new team section

93
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,980
or group I've definitely seen that occur

94
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:21,949
that's a major achievement getting a new

95
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:24,179
job or a roller or responsibility

96
00:03:21,949 --> 00:03:26,489
actually convincing another human of

97
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:30,150
anything at all that they didn't already

98
00:03:26,489 --> 00:03:33,329
believe in is frankly quite tough so how

99
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:36,480
did these people both decide to do it

100
00:03:33,329 --> 00:03:37,500
and achieve it okay so let's think now

101
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,328
about ourselves

102
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,280
wait what's something you've achieved

103
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:43,139
and perhaps not on that scale but kind

104
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,269
of anything at all maybe it was having

105
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:48,000
kids getting married maybe you fixed a

106
00:03:45,269 --> 00:03:49,739
software bug something like that was it

107
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,260
because your boss added it to your KPIs

108
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:55,889
or because somebody else said you know

109
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,899
you've got to do this or actually did

110
00:03:55,889 --> 00:03:59,940
you just decide for yourself I'm willing

111
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,199
to bet is because you decided for

112
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,150
yourself that may have happened after

113
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,769
your boss gave you the kpi's it might

114
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,239
have happened after somebody said you

115
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:07,739
know I'd really like you to take this on

116
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,930
but I think it will have been your

117
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:12,900
decision making and now the rest of this

118
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,699
talk is really just footnotes so once

119
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:17,699
you've realized that basic fact about

120
00:04:14,699 --> 00:04:20,340
why people do anything at all which is

121
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:22,169
because they want to everything else

122
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:23,820
really just follows from how you lay

123
00:04:22,169 --> 00:04:26,130
that path down in front of those other

124
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,330
people and you recognize that that's

125
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:29,550
that's the prob

126
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:32,039
one of getting support into software

127
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:34,289
development or anything at all okay so

128
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:36,780
let's go back to the beginning I was a

129
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:38,400
developer I had a goal and I'd go out

130
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,929
and I would climb that mountain and I

131
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,878
would build that feature set and it was

132
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,610
sunny and it was good and I liked it and

133
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:46,409
then somebody said Tennessee you should

134
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:49,469
probably Google something about software

135
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:52,889
security I've heard it's important and I

136
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:54,719
did and I've never been able to unsee

137
00:04:52,889 --> 00:04:56,520
software security ever since and that

138
00:04:54,719 --> 00:04:58,830
that that's what I felt like after that

139
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,299
person walked past my desk and said you

140
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,849
know you should probably have a think

141
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,280
about software security so I'm not

142
00:05:02,849 --> 00:05:07,319
easily kind of intimidated by complex

143
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,270
tasks so I went back into my mind Palace

144
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:11,069
and and went into the cave and I sat

145
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,479
down and I worked out all of the the

146
00:05:11,069 --> 00:05:14,699
forks in the road and all of the things

147
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:18,180
no well you know what I reckon I could

148
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:20,069
fix software security okay all we need

149
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,599
is all of this that's it you just need

150
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:23,190
everything on that list it shouldn't be

151
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:24,599
that hard it'll only take you know a

152
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:26,819
complete organizational transformation

153
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:29,370
but it's obviously the right thing to do

154
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:30,900
so it should be easy then I spoke to all

155
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:32,639
my colleagues and I think they thought I

156
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:34,258
was just talking like this it just

157
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,180
didn't make sense it wasn't affordable

158
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:37,409
it wasn't doable it wasn't easy no one

159
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,830
was asking them to do it they didn't

160
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:43,050
know so but still actually we do need

161
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:45,389
all of this right this is actually what

162
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:48,360
you need but you don't get it by knowing

163
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:50,250
what you need so I went home and I

164
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,110
thought to myself everyone else just

165
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:54,419
seems to have gone away they still want

166
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:58,110
the outcome but they don't want my list

167
00:05:54,419 --> 00:06:00,568
what's going on so I'm like okay I guess

168
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:02,430
it really is something about people and

169
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:04,229
it's about buying and it's about that

170
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:06,150
question of how you decide to commit to

171
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:07,889
something yourself how do you get a

172
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:10,500
group of people to work together and go

173
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:12,089
yeah this is my job this is great I am

174
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:15,509
gonna do my part how do you convince

175
00:06:12,089 --> 00:06:18,300
another human of basically anything okay

176
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:20,219
so and I don't mean coercion or store or

177
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:22,139
resorting to stupidity when you think

178
00:06:20,219 --> 00:06:23,909
about other people's motivations it's

179
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,529
easy to become quite cynical but really

180
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:27,060
what you need to start to understand is

181
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:28,349
diversity you need to start

182
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:32,190
understanding just how different

183
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:34,020
everybody is and you can it you have to

184
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:36,990
embrace diversity that's not to say it

185
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:39,599
always helps embracing diversity does

186
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:41,250
not directly lead to the answer but just

187
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:43,170
lets you understand

188
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,480
the next problem which is starting to

189
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:47,520
understand the individuality and

190
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,410
everybody that you have to work with and

191
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,090
bring along that journey so your life

192
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:52,620
just gets a little bit more difficult I

193
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:54,179
didn't say any of this was going to be

194
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,500
easy by the way this is a presentation

195
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:57,300
on stuff that's actually really

196
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,150
difficult and I completely understand if

197
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,310
you go maybe I won't so big things

198
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:04,380
however our little things just stuck

199
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:06,600
together it's true in physics it's true

200
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:10,080
in life it's true of money it's true of

201
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:11,820
organizations so don't worry about the

202
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,289
scale of your problem too much just

203
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,330
concentrate on the little things and

204
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,920
sticking them together maybe explain to

205
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:18,090
some other people about why I should

206
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,740
stick some of those little things

207
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:22,109
together and if you can't convince

208
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,540
people of the need for all of the big

209
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:27,030
lists and you're still motivated to keep

210
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,860
trying just keep sticking little bits

211
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,840
together it'll be okay and if you do it

212
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,280
long enough and hard enough and some

213
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,770
people join you then eventually you'll

214
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,929
build a big thing so you've got to

215
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,760
identify early wins you've got to get

216
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:41,730
those things done and you've got to

217
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,530
amplify your results but it build

218
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:45,720
awareness familiarity and motivation

219
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:48,450
give some what people something they can

220
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,640
do don't give them the entire elephant

221
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:52,770
give them a small decision don't worry

222
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:55,469
if that decisions not going to get you

223
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:57,530
personally to your answer or even your

224
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:59,340
organization closer to that answer

225
00:07:57,530 --> 00:08:01,619
concentrate on the fact it's going to

226
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:03,239
bring that person to a greater sense of

227
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:06,870
confidence in being able to approach the

228
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,850
problems their way so it may directly

229
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:10,890
contribute to your technical strategy

230
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:12,810
but it's much more likely to bring

231
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:15,450
people on board as part of your people

232
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:17,100
strategy give people reasons they can

233
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:19,440
easily understand even if they don't

234
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:22,590
understand the full picture and accept

235
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,510
change is hard and slow so here are some

236
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:26,010
examples of actionable things none of

237
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:27,330
these are going to buy themselves fix

238
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:30,960
software security but they're actually

239
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:33,179
not very hard add security criteria to

240
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,799
job advertisements for developers hands

241
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,959
up in your organization I actually have

242
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,000
no idea how widespread this is if your

243
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,979
team your organization is hiring a dev

244
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,229
and you know the answer to this hands up

245
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:45,240
if anywhere in the selection criteria or

246
00:08:43,229 --> 00:08:49,890
job description is knowledge of secure

247
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:52,230
coding right bang okay so straight away

248
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,910
that's an incredibly achievable thing

249
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:54,990
you don't even have to ask your

250
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,000
selection committees to

251
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,620
CAIR all you actually have to and bike

252
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,420
of course they care I keep using the

253
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:02,610
word don't care when I mean don't

254
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:04,770
prioritize the important thing is not to

255
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:06,839
try to drive a deep and abiding passion

256
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:08,970
for software security into every human

257
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:10,830
everywhere it's to make people think and

258
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:12,750
reflect just take the small pot the

259
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:15,930
smallest possible action and worry about

260
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:17,970
the larger consequences later chase up

261
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:20,069
resolution of security issues with dev

262
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:21,360
teams keep reminding them that it's

263
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:24,240
important and that they need to think

264
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,120
about it send people outside your bubble

265
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,440
to security conferences and events

266
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,920
actually get people who are not in your

267
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:33,330
orbit into your orbit and then there's

268
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,130
some other things but they're on the

269
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:38,330
slide and I don't have enough time to go

270
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:41,100
through the reasons for each of them so

271
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:44,190
examples of actionable things that we

272
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,990
can do so the boundaries of your

273
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:48,270
organization are really just a figment

274
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:50,160
of the modern capitalist and legal

275
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:51,899
framework in which we happen to happen

276
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,569
to live there is very little stopping us

277
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:56,640
actually engaging with the other humans

278
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:58,709
of in this room regardless of our

279
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,870
employer I say regardless you know like

280
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:03,089
asterisk asterisk yes sometimes it can

281
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:04,350
matter but by and large there is very

282
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:05,790
little stopping us from being a

283
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,589
community of practice and coming

284
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:09,930
together at conferences events and all

285
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:12,089
sorts of other places to actually learn

286
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:14,279
from each other and it's not just about

287
00:10:12,089 --> 00:10:16,050
learning there's a network effect and

288
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:18,480
the popularity effect and an important

289
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:20,880
effect and a perception effect that we

290
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:23,820
could in fact all choose to do if I pick

291
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,189
I don't know that person and say how

292
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:28,079
about all of us email their director

293
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:29,550
tomorrow of their company and say hey I

294
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,069
met this guy at a conference he's

295
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:35,430
amazing you should do what he said what

296
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:37,230
would happen next I don't know I imagine

297
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,569
the director would notice if he got 30

298
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:41,970
emails and I imagine that person would

299
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:44,279
get a phone call about it so if we

300
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:46,680
wanted to and we chose to act

301
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:49,560
collectively we could achieve great

302
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:51,630
things if we wanted to that specific

303
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,369
course of action is not recommended but

304
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:55,890
something similar but slightly less

305
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:58,380
dramatic is recommended invite people

306
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:59,970
from outside your organization in a halo

307
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:02,430
effect from people outside your

308
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:04,050
organization is very well-known so find

309
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:06,029
somebody who thinks exactly what you

310
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:07,859
think and invite them to come and speak

311
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:09,179
and they will just that you know and

312
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,609
then build some

313
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:13,108
for that perspective perhaps also invite

314
00:11:11,609 --> 00:11:15,539
someone who doesn't think exactly what

315
00:11:13,109 --> 00:11:17,339
you think and get a range of views but

316
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:19,379
if you can start to demonstrate that

317
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:21,449
your knowledge isn't just in your head

318
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:23,609
coming out of what you happen to think

319
00:11:21,449 --> 00:11:25,139
but actually reflects a considered view

320
00:11:23,609 --> 00:11:27,539
from a range of different people and

321
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:30,119
perspectives it's very likely to get

322
00:11:27,539 --> 00:11:32,489
more support also simple human memory

323
00:11:30,119 --> 00:11:35,129
and messaging is very effective one of

324
00:11:32,489 --> 00:11:36,569
the tenets of accepting facts in media

325
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:38,639
is make sure you've got three separate

326
00:11:36,569 --> 00:11:39,929
sources why because by the time you've

327
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:41,789
got enough sources you're far more

328
00:11:39,929 --> 00:11:43,829
likely to accept that statement as

329
00:11:41,789 --> 00:11:45,359
factually correct so if you're going to

330
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:47,309
take that same view that there's

331
00:11:45,359 --> 00:11:49,679
advantages there's repetition advantages

332
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:51,738
and there's independent observations

333
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:55,289
building a greater consensus position

334
00:11:51,739 --> 00:11:57,839
advantages send an email to a colleagues

335
00:11:55,289 --> 00:11:59,220
boss find a developer it doesn't really

336
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:02,249
matter if they're very good at the job

337
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:03,569
say they're very good at the job ideally

338
00:12:02,249 --> 00:12:05,579
they would be very good at the job but

339
00:12:03,569 --> 00:12:07,410
my point is is it's not about whether

340
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:09,569
they're very good at the job it's about

341
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:11,129
getting engagement and buying it's about

342
00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:13,709
saying hey this person is really

343
00:12:11,129 --> 00:12:15,359
fantastic they did a really good job at

344
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:17,039
pick something they did a really good

345
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:19,669
job at you'll be able to find something

346
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:21,899
people are awesome and then just say

347
00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:23,999
they'd really benefit from this

348
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:26,429
conference about what you happen to care

349
00:12:23,999 --> 00:12:28,379
about they could go benefit and bring

350
00:12:26,429 --> 00:12:30,059
that back to the team this person is

351
00:12:28,379 --> 00:12:31,499
going to love you as a result and you

352
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:33,988
might be able to build some support

353
00:12:31,499 --> 00:12:36,119
indirectly imagine if you got that email

354
00:12:33,989 --> 00:12:38,459
or your boss got that email that would

355
00:12:36,119 --> 00:12:42,419
be a positive act so it's quite possible

356
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:45,439
to take these internal small steps to

357
00:12:42,419 --> 00:12:48,809
actually build support in small ways

358
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:50,639
okay so back to the boring version how

359
00:12:48,809 --> 00:12:54,269
does all of that relate to what you

360
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,129
actually need so you may find your list

361
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:57,689
varies everybody is very interested in

362
00:12:56,129 --> 00:12:59,579
the list of what we actually need yes

363
00:12:57,689 --> 00:13:01,709
this is the my opinion of the list of

364
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:03,659
what we actually need but it's just not

365
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:05,429
going to win hearts and minds no one's

366
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:07,289
gonna care unless they already

367
00:13:05,429 --> 00:13:09,569
understand these particular things and

368
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:11,220
their benefits the way people care is

369
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:13,248
because all of the other things that

370
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,869
you're solving around the people problem

371
00:13:13,249 --> 00:13:18,299
so I will go into some specific groups

372
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:20,129
so how do you convince developers first

373
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:22,170
of all what happened to me show them

374
00:13:20,129 --> 00:13:24,420
things that cannot be unseen

375
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:26,910
just send them send them the right

376
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,459
YouTube videos and the right content and

377
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,930
share personal motivation will it

378
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:33,869
convince at least some of them to take

379
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:35,638
it more seriously have a quiet chat to

380
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:39,389
them about professional responsibilities

381
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:42,990
so it who expects a software developer

382
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:45,600
in this room by and large to take like a

383
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:48,300
professionalized level of responsibility

384
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,740
if I hire an architect the spaces in my

385
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:52,199
house should be right if I take my car

386
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:54,120
to the mechanic you know my car should

387
00:13:52,199 --> 00:13:56,550
be serviced correctly if I hire a lawyer

388
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,220
they're liable for the legal advice is a

389
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:00,959
software developer forget legal because

390
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:03,779
that's clearly not the case are they

391
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:06,119
actually liable for the security of the

392
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:07,620
software that they build you know at

393
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,209
face value hands up anyone who thinks

394
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,639
yeah that's exactly what they should be

395
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:15,359
responsible for you'd like to think

396
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:17,130
wrong okay so that is in fact not true

397
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,620
and is a common misconception and a

398
00:14:17,130 --> 00:14:21,810
great a great deal of people would like

399
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:24,930
it to be the case but it's not actually

400
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:26,609
a valid assumption so certainly it's not

401
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:29,459
a valid assumption for anyone around

402
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:31,079
about my age plus maybe five years

403
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:33,349
younger it does seem to be changing in

404
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:36,029
at the moment when I went to university

405
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:38,550
there were no software security courses

406
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:40,320
I did computer science and nobody ever

407
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,939
said anything about software security

408
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,370
back in the first year

409
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:46,140
maybe someone said something about dodgy

410
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:48,089
sequel statements but like that was it

411
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:49,769
an organization paid me and they said

412
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:52,100
climb the mountain and I climbed the

413
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:53,760
mountain and it's not it's not in

414
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:55,079
University

415
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,660
there's no professionalized

416
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:59,279
accreditation that requires it it wasn't

417
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:01,500
a condition of employment that I uphold

418
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,449
those things it wasn't in my duty

419
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,730
statement it's not in anyone's Duty

420
00:15:03,449 --> 00:15:08,699
statement that I know of it's actually

421
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:10,589
not a veidt's not treated as a core

422
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:12,390
expectation it's treated as something

423
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:14,880
your manager needs to tell you to do

424
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:17,040
otherwise please don't bother so when

425
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,500
you hire a software developer first up

426
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:22,290
just change your tapes around what's

427
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,420
incentivizing them at work and what what

428
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:25,680
kind of people are applying there what

429
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:27,360
they're good people

430
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,189
I don't mean that I don't mean kind of

431
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,839
people in a pejorative sense but they're

432
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:33,390
people who want to build functionality

433
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:35,910
and what you're asking them to do unless

434
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:38,040
they've seen what can't be unseen

435
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:40,020
is build functionality and capability

436
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,390
and they will just expect the computer

437
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:44,790
to do it properly right I'm using the

438
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:45,930
libraries I'm using the language what do

439
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:48,030
you mean it's insecure

440
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:51,540
isn't that the operating system vendors

441
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:53,160
problem I don't know so foot so I'm not

442
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:54,870
trying to berate all of those

443
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,310
wonderfully positive people who just

444
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,200
said yes I expect people to build

445
00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:00,089
software securely I'm just trying to

446
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,770
give an overly long explanation to

447
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:04,200
something that's commonly misunderstood

448
00:16:01,770 --> 00:16:05,760
about whether or not to expect secure

449
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,620
software coming out of a software

450
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:12,390
development team now this will vary

451
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:13,440
widely by by age area of development if

452
00:16:12,390 --> 00:16:15,330
you're if you're building something

453
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,250
internet-facing which most people are

454
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:19,380
it's very likely to be a priority for

455
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:21,330
the team in some form but don't expect

456
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:23,430
it to be a universal piece of knowledge

457
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:27,990
or just come with the job title I guess

458
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:30,300
is all I'm trying to say if I can inject

459
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:32,690
a question there I was basically saying

460
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:35,280
based on your language chosen

461
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:37,110
professional responsibility which should

462
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:39,630
indicate that they should be ongoing

463
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:40,890
learning new techniques materials

464
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,930
understanding what the current state of

465
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:44,340
play is and improving their own

466
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:45,839
knowledge around how to actually build

467
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:47,880
fully functional software between

468
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:52,350
software that can't be compromised yes

469
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:54,780
very much so so how do enable developers

470
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:57,810
is how I've phrased how I've included

471
00:16:54,780 --> 00:17:00,060
some of that kind of content so buy them

472
00:16:57,810 --> 00:17:01,739
time or budget whatever it is that they

473
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,200
don't have that they would need in order

474
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:05,819
to actually put some time into this get

475
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:07,650
their managers on board so that you've

476
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:10,020
built it into whatever incentive system

477
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:12,180
or project management lifecycle it is

478
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:14,490
that they happen to live under give them

479
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:18,210
skills technical skills professional

480
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:21,000
skills and people skills people often

481
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:23,280
talk about soft skills but they're okay

482
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,990
I hate the term and B it doesn't

483
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,879
actually tell you what it is that you

484
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:29,280
need to learn if I just said like go

485
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,830
learn soft skills I don't think it's

486
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,210
very useful but actually people skills

487
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,980
and professional skills will tell people

488
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,630
like you know professional skills okay

489
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,610
should be able to write an email write a

490
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:41,250
good document write a report you know

491
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:43,770
run a meeting you make sure I attend to

492
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:46,970
my deadlines function in an organization

493
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:49,860
people skills I should be able to if

494
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:52,230
software is insecure or has problem

495
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,120
I may choose to say you know it could

496
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:55,980
possibly benefit from further security

497
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,439
set testing instead of it's horribly

498
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:00,000
insecure but I would actually be able to

499
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,380
say to someone who said is this software

500
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,230
secure I'd be able to answer them

501
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:08,130
factually even if I use the right words

502
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:09,450
to do so give them CIC D with security

503
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:12,330
automation that's a real technical

504
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:14,280
enabler any technical enabler really but

505
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:16,230
that that was my primary example and

506
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:19,799
just help them with whatever monkeys on

507
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:21,780
their back for anyone not from not from

508
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,490
my particular cultural background having

509
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,350
a monkey on your back is a euphemism of

510
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:26,880
you want to do something but you can't

511
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:29,129
because there's a monkey on your back

512
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,929
and you have to get that off first so a

513
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:33,750
lot of teams will be faced with various

514
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:35,070
monkeys on their back and yeah you

515
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,690
should be able to just go in and say

516
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:38,460
please fix your security problems but

517
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:39,750
that doesn't make their life any easier

518
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:42,059
they've still got a monkey on their back

519
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:44,100
so you need to start understanding if

520
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:45,840
you really want to yes you should be

521
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:48,330
able to say just do it but if that

522
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,409
doesn't work you know feel free to try

523
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:51,059
it a few times and then you'll

524
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:53,160
understand you know that it's not going

525
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:54,590
to work help them under help understand

526
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:57,570
what monkeys they've got in their back

527
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:59,428
okay how to convince managers right the

528
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:02,820
number one thing is just sound like

529
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:04,490
you're across everything right just

530
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:07,200
sound like you've got it nailed

531
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:09,570
preferably by actually knowing

532
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,240
everything and actually having it nailed

533
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:14,399
but if you don't still sound like you're

534
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,380
across everything work out how to say

535
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,360
I'll take that under advisement

536
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:20,070
in a way that sounds like I've thought

537
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:22,199
about it but I really want to give you a

538
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:26,428
thorough answer rather than I'm

539
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:28,020
hopelessly lost so one of the good ways

540
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:30,870
is to know the names of everybody

541
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:32,639
involved I struggle a lot with names but

542
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,750
actually most of your managers are not

543
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,600
going to know they're going to know the

544
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:37,710
names of the people a lot more than

545
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:40,110
they're going to know what anything

546
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:42,059
actually does all why it does it or how

547
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:44,428
its strung together so one of the

548
00:19:42,059 --> 00:19:46,860
easiest ways to convince a manager that

549
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:49,650
you are in fact across everything is to

550
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:51,510
know the name of everybody directly

551
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:53,309
involved and then be able to talk to

552
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:56,400
your manager and say yeah I've talked to

553
00:19:53,309 --> 00:19:59,370
so-and-so right have key facts at your

554
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,290
disposal and keep them simple know how

555
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:03,600
many security and vulnerabilities are in

556
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:05,668
your system and I don't mean like keeper

557
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,530
real-time app that like monitors every

558
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:10,919
build I just mean yeah last week on

559
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:14,100
Thursday though of 23 critical volatile

560
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:15,270
okay didn't know know some facts so that

561
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,740
you can rattle them out at a moment's

562
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,629
notice

563
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:20,669
talk about reduced costs from improved

564
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:22,230
relationships don't attempt to do

565
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:24,990
anything about it other than improve the

566
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:27,960
relationships but talk about it say that

567
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:31,289
you are brokering relationships or

568
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:33,900
getting security onboard etc etc don't

569
00:20:31,289 --> 00:20:36,299
really focus on the the costs or what's

570
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,130
involved in these things just make it

571
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:40,408
clear that you've looked at what today

572
00:20:38,130 --> 00:20:42,020
you know the people and you know what's

573
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:44,280
next okay

574
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:46,440
managers will generally be much more

575
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,629
improving in interested in proving

576
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,340
vulnerable

577
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:51,960
exploit actual exploits you can actually

578
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:53,789
get in and break things like there are

579
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:55,650
so many vulnerabilities just kind of

580
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:58,710
everywhere particularly in developed

581
00:20:55,650 --> 00:21:00,510
systems under development etc that like

582
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:02,309
people just suffer from there's just too

583
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,840
much noise and you've got to cut through

584
00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:05,928
it so something that cuts through as an

585
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,629
actual yeah I got in kind of statement

586
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:10,530
to enable them don't leave them

587
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:12,900
apologizing in a meeting full of their

588
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:14,908
peers don't leave them ignorant and try

589
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:17,010
to never be wrong it's much better to

590
00:21:14,909 --> 00:21:19,200
say far fewer things but completely

591
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:22,049
correctly than it is to say a lot of

592
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:23,820
things or preface and fudge the saying a

593
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:25,620
lot of things say like well I don't know

594
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,939
every particular fact about the

595
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,699
following statements but my impression

596
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,900
is blah it'll kind of annoy them but it

597
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,600
means that they're not going to go into

598
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:36,240
a meeting and then have your perspective

599
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,070
be closed by someone else in that

600
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,559
meeting and be unable to then assess

601
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:42,689
whether or not you know your limits so

602
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,010
some of the the key facts are basically

603
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:46,350
the manager is going to be in some

604
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:47,879
meeting you don't know about you didn't

605
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:49,620
see coming it's going to be incredibly

606
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,020
important someone who's out there

607
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:53,789
jockeying for their job or their budget

608
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,049
or in some context there's nothing to do

609
00:21:53,789 --> 00:21:57,150
with what you're trying to achieve is

610
00:21:55,049 --> 00:21:59,460
going to take them to task on something

611
00:21:57,150 --> 00:22:00,929
and if you've let them be wrong they're

612
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,179
going to lose that political fight

613
00:22:00,929 --> 00:22:05,250
regardless of what it has to do with you

614
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:07,890
so make sure that they've got a small

615
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:10,320
crisp set of genuine facts that are

616
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:12,049
unopposed ly correct that they can just

617
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,158
kind of fall back on in those forums

618
00:22:12,049 --> 00:22:15,780
don't talk about how long it takes or

619
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,100
how much effort is involved as far as I

620
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:19,379
can tell that just generally

621
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,879
people off get them to the point where

622
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,740
they care about your problem and then

623
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,780
they will to start trying to understand

624
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:26,880
those questions for themselves and then

625
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,990
when that happens and they're coming to

626
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,500
you go for it

627
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:34,289
okay then you'll always be faced with

628
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:39,090
resistance so you're going to have to be

629
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:40,410
ready to make some noise and make this -

630
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:43,379
there's two ways there's making noise

631
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:45,600
and there's persistence you either

632
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:48,169
you've either got to be loud or you've

633
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,189
got to be a weed if you want to be loud

634
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:52,590
reporting reporting reporting reporting

635
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:55,500
get in there talk about it all the time

636
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:57,120
be across everything in every meeting

637
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:59,580
just make sure you got facts and just

638
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,219
say it say it say it say it say it don't

639
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,689
necessarily really bother people but

640
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,130
just always look like you're really

641
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:09,539
interested in what's trying to be

642
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:11,010
achieved or be a weed get in there find

643
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:13,020
the person in your development team that

644
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:14,820
actually cares and keep distracting them

645
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:16,918
with these problems make sure that

646
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:19,049
you're in there and everybody knows that

647
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:21,090
if they look the other way you're gonna

648
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:22,590
be in there and you're gonna notice and

649
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:24,030
you're gonna figure it out and you're

650
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:25,320
gonna tell someone about it and then

651
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:26,850
you're gonna email them and you're gonna

652
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:28,590
email them tomorrow and they're gonna

653
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,730
email in the day after that and then

654
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:31,168
you're gonna check in in a week and

655
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,630
they're just not gonna get away with

656
00:23:31,169 --> 00:23:34,950
anything right I don't mean be super

657
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:37,650
annoying you you know there's a there's

658
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:39,390
a fine line here but I do mean be

659
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:40,919
exactly the right amount of persistent

660
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:42,809
make them go because they'll just forget

661
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,919
you the first two or three times right

662
00:23:42,809 --> 00:23:46,139
like these are people who probably

663
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:48,809
struggle to remember your name okay so

664
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,970
make sure that you've got to build that

665
00:23:48,809 --> 00:23:52,860
reinforcement in with them and it goes

666
00:23:50,970 --> 00:23:55,380
back to being right about things go I

667
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:57,120
fixed for vulnerabilities yeah sure I

668
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:58,890
found them with static analysis and it

669
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,658
was a one-line fix for all four at once

670
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:02,370
but I did it do you remember that I did

671
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:04,140
that well I found another fall and you

672
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:05,729
know what I fixed them too and you know

673
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,320
what your team has found another fall

674
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:08,580
and I told them how to fix those four

675
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,049
and I told them how to fix those four

676
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,789
and I've helped them fix these three and

677
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:13,139
Kevon in the lead the lead development

678
00:24:11,789 --> 00:24:14,820
position is really beginning to get it

679
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,440
and I think he's great you should send

680
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,970
him on a software conference and by the

681
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:20,250
way this is really important and it's

682
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:21,659
part of your KPIs now so make sure to

683
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,850
understand the nature of your own

684
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:25,679
persistence in influencing the people

685
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:28,260
around you it's not always going to

686
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,970
succeed I fail as often as I succeed but

687
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,750
if you really want to make a difference

688
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,950
really

689
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,300
you got to make some noise and really

690
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:35,430
you've got to be persistent you've got

691
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:37,139
to get good at making noise that isn't

692
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:40,080
going to absolutely just turn people off

693
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:42,630
so there's a definite judgement and risk

694
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:44,220
of risk balance in how much noise and

695
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:48,270
how persistent you are but they're

696
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:50,190
basically the techniques so bringing

697
00:24:48,270 --> 00:24:52,050
that into a professional context you

698
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:53,610
know this is again this is kind of the

699
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:55,350
list feel free to take more photos of

700
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:57,419
lists this is basically what you need to

701
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:59,040
figure out for reporting so you need to

702
00:24:57,420 --> 00:25:02,130
understand how your organization tracks

703
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:04,710
risks basic metrics and frameworks so

704
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:06,720
don't try to just completely invent your

705
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:08,460
own framework if you don't have to go

706
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,460
find whatever your organization already

707
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:13,380
uses and try to leverage that people

708
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:15,600
will already be making if you can get

709
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:17,850
invited as a fly on the wall to the

710
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:20,280
right meetings like decisions and

711
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:22,860
organizations omit about risk are made

712
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,750
regularly and so a budget decisions if

713
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,250
you can start to see who's making them

714
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:27,660
you've got to go back and you got to see

715
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:29,940
this whole thing as a network of

716
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:32,040
decision making all the if statements

717
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,470
are people making judgment calls right

718
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:36,120
all of the logic in the organization is

719
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:38,700
already there you've got to figure out

720
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:40,679
who's who's the if statement and what's

721
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,080
their decision criteria and then apply

722
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:45,360
your two techniques to those people get

723
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:48,449
good at all of these things okay

724
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,919
so conclusions focus on what you can do

725
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:52,020
what you can't that's a general life

726
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:54,690
skill you'll just kind of go mad if you

727
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:57,030
focus too much on what you can't control

728
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:58,860
look that that's true what I simply

729
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:00,750
consider my laundry you know I just need

730
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:03,540
to focus on what laundry I can do today

731
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:05,010
and yes it's good to have a plan for the

732
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:07,740
future that it has a realistic and

733
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:09,840
achievable goal in it but the focus has

734
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:11,700
to be on what you can do one on actually

735
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:13,320
getting it done make sure you get it

736
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,870
over the line in every possible way

737
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:18,090
don't just do your bit and go I did my

738
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:21,239
bit work out what's going to stop you

739
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:23,100
getting from a all the way to a

740
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,530
conclusion no matter how small that

741
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:27,419
piece of work is make sure it gets all

742
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:29,700
the way done the number of things that

743
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:31,530
get mostly done and then it takes either

744
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:34,470
just as long again to get all the way

745
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:36,149
done or get rolled back is enormous your

746
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:37,890
ability to make an impact is going to be

747
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:40,350
much more influenced by getting things

748
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:42,780
all the way done even if you have a much

749
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:44,610
tighter focus people will come up with

750
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:46,830
their own solutions if they're motivated

751
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:50,459
and enabled this was a particular

752
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:52,980
challenge for me to deal with when I was

753
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,720
a developer I was a one of my old bosses

754
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,580
they called me a solution here right

755
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,830
like I would show up and I would like

756
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,909
figure the whole thing out and I'll tell

757
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:04,139
you right this is what we should do a

758
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:06,030
figured it out and that was a function

759
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:08,970
of two things one is is just how my own

760
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:11,070
brain works and the other thing was my

761
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:13,110
own frustrations with the people around

762
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:15,120
me I've always wanted a solution here

763
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:17,729
for a boss right I've always wanted

764
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,350
someone who I really trusted to have

765
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,179
figured things out so this is what I

766
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:22,649
tried to do as soon as I got in any kind

767
00:27:21,179 --> 00:27:25,470
of leadership role but where I fell over

768
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:27,660
is that that's what motivated me and

769
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:30,390
it's not what motivated everybody else

770
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:33,179
and so I really if you focus on the

771
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:35,040
people in the equation like yes you need

772
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:36,780
to be technically across your stuff yes

773
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:38,549
you need to be able to explain to them

774
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:40,740
in simple terms exactly what the problem

775
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:43,740
is etc etc but your goal is not your

776
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:46,110
solution or even your path your goal is

777
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,700
influencing that individual again and

778
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:50,219
again and again and again for different

779
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:52,500
people along the way big things are just

780
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,840
little things put together so support so

781
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,299
teamwork so is a positive atmosphere so

782
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:59,730
so that that's why some people just seem

783
00:27:57,299 --> 00:28:01,410
to be able to succeed but sometimes

784
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:03,510
these things are just a sign of their

785
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:04,799
times the atmosphere is right someone's

786
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:06,840
tapped into the fact that there's a

787
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,549
collective mood for action and they're

788
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,770
in the right place at the right at the

789
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:12,629
right time sometimes you can cause it to

790
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:14,790
occur and sometimes it'll happen to you

791
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:16,110
it's hard to say but big things are

792
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:19,799
definitely just little things put

793
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:21,540
together okay so that's I think all of

794
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:23,580
the content that I have prepared for you

795
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:26,040
today I appear to have 10 minutes left

796
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:28,590
which is shocking for us having so many

797
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:31,260
slides so I think we can have a little

798
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:34,520
Q&A well I'm gonna ask one first I want

799
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:37,620
your dream job which where was it

800
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:39,360
somewhere here basically win the lotto

801
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:42,750
and be able to work on moonshot projects

802
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:45,540
yeah I would like my dream job so you

803
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:47,130
talked about how to actually do get all

804
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:50,120
of this enabled and actually functioning

805
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:53,550
without support from the organization

806
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:55,379
yeah um your job title is head of secure

807
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:57,240
coding yes that is accurate little bit

808
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:58,440
about that okay so that is to some

809
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,700
degree the outcome of how

810
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,639
having done all of these things

811
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:05,159
potentially with so when I say without

812
00:29:02,639 --> 00:29:08,549
support my organization has supported me

813
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:10,379
and but it the ability to make an

814
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:12,450
influence wasn't because of the support

815
00:29:10,379 --> 00:29:14,428
so there are two two characterizations

816
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:16,769
I'll give to that one is is that these

817
00:29:14,429 --> 00:29:18,990
techniques don't change with your level

818
00:29:16,769 --> 00:29:19,769
of authority nor do the chant the fact

819
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:22,259
that you're going to have challenges

820
00:29:19,769 --> 00:29:26,070
change with your level of authority so

821
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:27,539
it can see so building support is going

822
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:29,759
to have to happen regardless of your

823
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:31,710
level of formal authority and you will

824
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:33,629
have our position regardless of your

825
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:35,779
level of formal of authority including

826
00:29:33,629 --> 00:29:38,850
all the way to the top of your

827
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:41,820
organization so to some degree it in

828
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:44,039
fact can get more competitive like I

829
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:45,870
would say more not necessarily but it's

830
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:48,120
just as competitive this just as much

831
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:50,370
opposition between jockeying for budgets

832
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:52,620
and ideas and objectives at the top as

833
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:55,049
there is at the bottom so being able to

834
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:58,018
build support is kind of independent of

835
00:29:55,049 --> 00:30:00,179
of where you are and it's very unlikely

836
00:29:58,019 --> 00:30:02,220
that you are going to get universal

837
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:04,559
support so the act of needing to build

838
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:06,299
support it's just a universal constant

839
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,769
there are not organizations that support

840
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:10,408
you in organizations that you don't

841
00:30:07,769 --> 00:30:12,600
there are collections of people yes some

842
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:14,309
of them might be in a more fortuitous or

843
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,719
less fortuitous state at any point in

844
00:30:14,309 --> 00:30:17,940
time you're still just going to have to

845
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,399
go do this so the fact that whether

846
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,929
support of it is there or not it's a bit

847
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,908
of a distraction it's kind of my little

848
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:25,950
funny tongue-in-cheek joking the title

849
00:30:23,909 --> 00:30:27,870
if you will you've got to build support

850
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:29,759
regardless of where you are if you need

851
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:31,320
to make a change almost by definition

852
00:30:29,759 --> 00:30:34,139
there's going to be a lot of convincing

853
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:36,178
of people so yes my position is now head

854
00:30:34,139 --> 00:30:39,389
of cyber security engineering so it was

855
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:41,429
head of security but quite recently out

856
00:30:39,389 --> 00:30:43,379
like after submitting my abstract but

857
00:30:41,429 --> 00:30:46,350
before coming to assert I changed into

858
00:30:43,379 --> 00:30:47,969
cyber security engineering but I didn't

859
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:50,879
update the abstract because it just

860
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:52,919
didn't happen so largely that's because

861
00:30:50,879 --> 00:30:54,449
of a number of things one is in my

862
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:55,830
context they wanted someone with that

863
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:58,500
development background who could focus

864
00:30:55,830 --> 00:31:00,480
on on the engineering side of things but

865
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:02,220
also it's because of being able to glue

866
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,230
together some of these different kinds

867
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,360
of concern and objective and sort of see

868
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:09,360
some of that that brought a picture but

869
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:11,219
it's not because of like great unbridled

870
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,969
ability or it's certainly not because of

871
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,649
that it's

872
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:16,200
it's just because of a willingness to be

873
00:31:13,649 --> 00:31:18,479
stubborn and persistent as my weed I'm a

874
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,309
weed yes I'm definitely impressed so

875
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,570
that's a paraphrase so that you'd

876
00:31:20,309 --> 00:31:23,299
basically say regardless of

877
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:26,189
organizational support regardless of

878
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:27,779
structural support everybody who has an

879
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:29,850
interest in this needs to basically be

880
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:31,139
persistent peer level management managed

881
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:34,408
up the line managed down the line and

882
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:36,178
basically push that push the secure

883
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:38,190
coding methodology and frameworks and

884
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:44,909
and message header after what you

885
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:50,059
possibly can as a recent taking charge

886
00:31:44,909 --> 00:31:52,830
of an IT security team organization and

887
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:54,690
luckily working alongside the person

888
00:31:52,830 --> 00:31:57,000
we're replacing for a while on a gradual

889
00:31:54,690 --> 00:32:01,710
handover and seeing the gross inability

890
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:04,710
of enforcement type approaches with IT

891
00:32:01,710 --> 00:32:06,840
staff and developers and general IT

892
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:10,350
staff and getting them to do things

893
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:12,629
safely in secure way basically you can't

894
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:14,820
mandate anything with them I'm just

895
00:32:12,629 --> 00:32:17,939
wondering yeah you you really had some

896
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:20,129
good strategies there but appealing is

897
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:22,529
there any hidden key or something that

898
00:32:20,129 --> 00:32:25,019
you appealed to in that mindset of the

899
00:32:22,529 --> 00:32:27,480
IT technical person or is it just

900
00:32:25,019 --> 00:32:29,190
you've got to wrangle your way in and

901
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,409
make friends with them so that you can

902
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:35,309
get change and they can be doing things

903
00:32:31,409 --> 00:32:38,669
in a more secure way so it's a good

904
00:32:35,309 --> 00:32:41,580
question so there's a few angles okay so

905
00:32:38,669 --> 00:32:43,710
one is the people angle people including

906
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:45,480
technical people are not the same

907
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:48,299
there's as much diversity among

908
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:50,610
technical people as any other people so

909
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:52,200
their individual motivations are going

910
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:53,969
to be just as diverse as any other group

911
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,860
they'll have some things in common but

912
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:59,009
ultimately you're really going to get to

913
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:59,279
know the specific people and go one by

914
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:01,830
one

915
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,779
really eventually if something becomes

916
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:05,668
part of the cultural part of the general

917
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:07,830
way things are done the people will end

918
00:33:05,669 --> 00:33:09,779
up following and adopting that culture

919
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:11,549
because that's what people do but until

920
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:12,419
you've got that point it's really not

921
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:15,090
the people's fault

922
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:17,789
that's just our cultural change works it

923
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:19,379
can be very frustrating but being

924
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:20,850
frustrating doesn't actually mean it's

925
00:33:19,379 --> 00:33:24,059
bad it just means that our groups of

926
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:25,799
people work so in terms of whether there

927
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:28,110
is anything specific about

928
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:29,999
how technical people approach problems

929
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:33,178
certainly as a developer I was very

930
00:33:29,999 --> 00:33:35,820
interested in shifting the effort onto

931
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:38,399
an automated backbone so there are

932
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:40,320
various technical things which can

933
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,899
better enable people to adopt those

934
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,428
processes continuous integrations one of

935
00:33:42,899 --> 00:33:46,258
them if your development team doesn't

936
00:33:44,429 --> 00:33:48,119
want to adopt it so long as you can get

937
00:33:46,259 --> 00:33:50,190
read access to the repo you can just do

938
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:52,320
it for yourself so there's very little

939
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:54,029
stopping you from saying all right we're

940
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,950
just going to run a security audit once

941
00:33:54,029 --> 00:33:58,169
every three months and you just email

942
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:59,519
them the results of your CI CD once

943
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:01,470
every three months with all of the

944
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:03,119
boring stuff chopped out right like it

945
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:05,639
sounds like it's actually not very hard

946
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:07,350
to achieve it's quite doable and they'll

947
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:08,790
eventually get sick of your reports and

948
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:10,440
say look can you tell me how you're able

949
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:12,569
to generate these reports so frequently

950
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:14,129
with so little apparent effort and you

951
00:34:12,569 --> 00:34:15,750
know that there's a way to build on that

952
00:34:14,129 --> 00:34:17,839
I don't really know because I can't

953
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:20,250
comment on your specific organization

954
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:22,879
but that's generally what I've observed

955
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:22,879
is that helpful

956
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:27,569
so apart from socializing all of this

957
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:29,279
type of change getting security out

958
00:34:27,569 --> 00:34:31,020
there is a message and start get people

959
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,609
at least thinking about secure coding as

960
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:35,730
they work on projects they're working on

961
00:34:32,609 --> 00:34:37,500
what nuts and bolts things would you

962
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:38,639
actually try and start to implement or

963
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,980
at least get them to think about

964
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:42,599
implementing themselves as the first

965
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:44,549
steps in terms of actually getting your

966
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:47,819
development team or development practice

967
00:34:44,549 --> 00:34:50,489
to help themselves bootstrap into SQL

968
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:54,149
coding practices is anyone here in a

969
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:56,790
development team two people three right

970
00:34:54,149 --> 00:35:00,589
did right what what do you think you

971
00:34:56,790 --> 00:35:03,589
need the most to take one step forward

972
00:35:00,589 --> 00:35:03,589
time

973
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:28,058
time right yes so that that's a great

974
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:29,290
question I'll repeat what I took away

975
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:32,200
from it for the benefit of the

976
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:34,779
microphone and bash it as well so I

977
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:37,569
think if I take that away is standards

978
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:38,829
life cycles common approaches there

979
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:42,099
seems to be a lack of some of these

980
00:35:38,829 --> 00:35:43,750
things so I talked to a lot of people at

981
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:45,400
conferences this is not about my

982
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:48,339
organization my organization doesn't

983
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:50,500
have one set dedicated way most

984
00:35:48,339 --> 00:35:53,740
organizations don't most most teams

985
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,910
don't so there are many the problem is

986
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:57,009
not there are no standards there are

987
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:58,779
many standards and they're generally

988
00:35:57,010 --> 00:36:01,809
some organizations who are very

989
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:03,790
conscious may impose these but they've

990
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:05,859
generally not been found to directly

991
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:07,779
lead to results I would generally put

992
00:36:05,859 --> 00:36:09,339
them in that category of like things

993
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,780
that might be part of your technical

994
00:36:09,339 --> 00:36:12,819
strategy but aren't going to help you

995
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:15,010
very much with your people strategy the

996
00:36:12,819 --> 00:36:18,460
the overlap is where you can give people

997
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:20,410
like a cut-down stent like a a standard

998
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:21,910
like do these five things and then

999
00:36:20,410 --> 00:36:23,200
you'll be alright and this is what we're

1000
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:25,899
going to expect of you for this

1001
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,009
particular period of time like make sure

1002
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:29,950
you deal with all the serious

1003
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:31,930
vulnerabilities and static analysis do

1004
00:36:29,950 --> 00:36:33,939
threat modeling once a year you know

1005
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:35,368
like just sort of simple things that

1006
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:38,829
everyone can wrap their heads around

1007
00:36:35,369 --> 00:36:41,500
become familiar with internalized baked

1008
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:42,670
into the culture and then move on things

1009
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:45,819
like saying if you could you please

1010
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:48,430
adopt the entire multi hundred page is M

1011
00:36:45,819 --> 00:36:50,200
or build every system completely

1012
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:52,210
compliant to the NIST framework like

1013
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,160
that that kind of standards I'm sure

1014
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,630
there's a time and a place for them but

1015
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,520
they're not going to be what gets

1016
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:59,559
anybody in the dev team out of bed in

1017
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:01,240
the morning again I'm sure asterik

1018
00:36:59,559 --> 00:37:03,730
asterik depends where you work but like

1019
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:05,890
by and large it's gonna it may assist

1020
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:07,450
you with your technical strategy but

1021
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:08,470
it's gonna be more of an objective than

1022
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:10,480
something that'll help you with your

1023
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:12,339
people about CMM level four or five

1024
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,859
rather than going from zero to ones -

1025
00:37:12,339 --> 00:37:17,109
that's right and by and large most

1026
00:37:14,859 --> 00:37:17,680
people looking at going 0 1 2 rather

1027
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:22,299
than

1028
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:24,069
and five great um we're pretty much on

1029
00:37:22,299 --> 00:37:26,310
time now so if everyone can please think

1030
00:37:24,069 --> 00:37:31,340
Tennessee front right

1031
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:31,340
[Applause]
