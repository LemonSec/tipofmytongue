a non-indigenous non traditional sense

58
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:07,799
I'm hosting a party tomorrow night and

59
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,300
you're one of the invited guests the way

60
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:11,009
you would come to my party is you would

61
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,900
open you wouldn't just come to my door

62
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:14,429
you wouldn't just

63
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,200
you wouldn't just knock on my front door

64
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,000
and you wouldn't just walk into my house

65
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,720
you would have to wait for me to invite

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,220
you in you wouldn't just open my fridge

67
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,959
just start eating my food and start

68
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,049
drinking my drinks you wouldn't do that

69
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,700
that would be disrespectful so welcome

70
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:31,680
in traditional sense it's how we operate

71
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:33,328
today which is when we go to someone's

72
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,280
house which you guys are in my house

73
00:02:33,329 --> 00:02:37,230
right now you would come and knock on my

74
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,720
door I would answer the door and choose

75
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,099
whether or not to let you in if I didn't

76
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,409
want you to come into my house you would

77
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,670
have to turn around and go away but this

78
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:45,828
morning I'm going to welcome you all

79
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,119
into my home

80
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:50,310
so now that you have permission to enter

81
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,950
my house open my fridge and start eating

82
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:54,450
my fruit and drinking my drinks if we

83
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:56,849
hold that thought of what a welcome to

84
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:59,129
country is it is me opening my home and

85
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:01,560
my lands to you in an indigenous sense

86
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:04,470
in Aboriginal sense in days gone by now

87
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,000
by us we have a similar fashion but we

88
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,620
didn't have a fridge we didn't have a

89
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,019
door and we didn't have a mobile phone

90
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:12,420
or anything like that so you would go to

91
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:13,890
the edge of your country and try to get

92
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:15,260
the attention of the neighboring people

93
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:17,578
next door

94
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,739
one way we would get the attention of

95
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:22,380
the neighboring the neighboring people

96
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:23,970
next door would we go to the border the

97
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,650
border between my land and the next

98
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:29,129
person's land could have been a river a

99
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,810
stream a set of trees or just a rock and

100
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:33,209
we will get to that rock and would light

101
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,919
a big fire the fire would produce smoke

102
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:37,169
and that smoke was a signal to the

103
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:39,419
custodians the owners of the land of

104
00:03:37,169 --> 00:03:40,859
which you wanted to gain entry to to say

105
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:42,389
hey there's some people at the border I

106
00:03:40,859 --> 00:03:44,639
think we should go over and see who it

107
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:47,010
is so the Warriors or some of the men

108
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:49,379
would go over to the border and light

109
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:51,870
the fire they would basically say hello

110
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:53,280
what do you want and you would say hey

111
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:54,720
I'd like to fish in your river

112
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,549
we know that the mullet is running now

113
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,169
and we would like to come and hunt the

114
00:03:56,549 --> 00:03:59,459
mullet to feed our children do you give

115
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:01,650
us permission to do this

116
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:03,120
the Warriors would then take the message

117
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,579
back to the leader of the tribe and

118
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,889
passed those words on it was up to the

119
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:10,109
elder whether or not to let you in so in

120
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:11,790
this case we've said yes then the

121
00:04:10,109 --> 00:04:13,470
Warriors would return to your fire and

122
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:15,750
say you have a mission to gain entry

123
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,639
into our land and to fish the river for

124
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,889
the mullet but you must adopt our rules

125
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,229
and our laws have for you to come in to

126
00:04:19,889 --> 00:04:25,560
and hunt our mullet you can only bring

127
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:26,639
in two worries to come and fish whatever

128
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,249
they carry is what you get

129
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,020
take them to feed your family

130
00:04:28,249 --> 00:04:33,210
respectfully we would have 100% pay the

131
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,248
law so if there were ten men waiting at

132
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:37,948
the fire only two men would gain entry

133
00:04:35,249 --> 00:04:39,810
and the other eight would wait the other

134
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:41,729
two men would go in and fish and hunt

135
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:43,490
until they got enough mullet they could

136
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:45,870
carry and they would all leave together

137
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:47,189
so when I say I welcome you and I

138
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:49,259
welcome you to the land so that you can

139
00:04:47,189 --> 00:04:51,300
bear people I am welcome you to my home

140
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:53,490
I'm giving you permission to gain entry

141
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:56,009
into my home but they are under my rules

142
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,659
and you respect those rules so today I

143
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:59,520
respectfully welcome you all to you can

144
00:04:57,659 --> 00:05:01,080

wonderful welcome to country for our

149
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,069
international guests in particular I

150
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,229
want you understand that's more than

151
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:18,569
just a quick chat about the rules about

152
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:19,830
fishing for mullet in Australia where

153
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,210
we're exceptionally proud of the fact

154
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:24,029
that our indigenous culture stretches

155
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:25,529
back tens of thousands possibly 60,000

156
00:05:24,029 --> 00:05:27,270
years so we thank our indigenous

157
00:05:25,529 --> 00:05:28,949
forebears for their custodianship of the

158
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:32,580
land upon which we meet today

159
00:05:28,949 --> 00:05:34,229
for this as I said the 18th absurd cyber

160
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,909

165

166

didn't quite understand what it's doing

167
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,729

00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:06,060
particular a couple of little bits of

179
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,378
housekeeping it has to race through

180
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,000
before introducing our first speaker in

181
00:06:07,379 --> 00:06:11,099

00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,120
side phones out of respect for the

192
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:33,628
presenters please turn your phones to

193
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,190
mobile off or on a silent I like to say

194
00:06:33,629 --> 00:06:36,419
at events like this we've got enough

195
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:38,190
breaks during the course that I just

196
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:39,280
look up free yourself on the screens and

197
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,420
soak up

198
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,309
what's going on here on the stage I

199
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,110
accept in this group that's a bigger

200
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,520
challenge than it is in some but if you

201
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,750
can break away from the screens the

202
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,490
presentations we got here today are

203
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:50,770
quite amazing most of you should have

204
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:52,870
installed the conference app by now use

205
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:54,370
that for writing the presentations check

206
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,600
in at each booth during the passport to

207
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,430
win prizes and all that sort of stuff

208
00:06:55,600 --> 00:07:00,610
and we're particularly excited the good

209
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:03,700
people at context are hosting a pone -

210
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:04,810
drone challenge now the objective of

211
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,219
this challenge is to allow our

212
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:07,600
participants to try their skills in

213
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:09,550
controlled semi representative

214
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,780
industrial control systems which include

215
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:11,919
a fully functioning Scot and network

216
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,030
including controllable traffic light

217
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,250
smart meters pump water storage

218
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:16,809
simulated smoke fire effects once

219
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,669
players have compromised the network

220
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,710
from the IT DMZ propagating through the

221
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:21,940
operational television network possible

222
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:25,060
to compromise and capture I've got no

223
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:27,250
idea what I'm saying as often happens

224
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,870
for me it also most of the individual

225
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,700
words and that paragraph makes sense to

226
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:32,590
me they have been placed together in an

227
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:35,020
order that render them gibberish but I'm

228
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:38,020
told it's a rocking challenge get along

229
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:39,250

registration desk and collect a shirt

232
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,549
and bag the interactive zone as always

233
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:47,020
goes off at also the Lego booth where

234
00:07:45,550 --> 00:07:48,550
you can build your own minifigs and the

235
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,620

236
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,210

279
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,560
it's a phrase that's coming out as a

280
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:26,800
team sport

with vendor products from our services

301
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:20,770

that you're not alone to hear more about

303
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:25,000

304
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,670
Operations Manager for all search to

305
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,150
talk a little bit about this thank you

306
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:33,250
thank you David welcome everyone really

307
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:34,959
excited to be here now that theme that

308
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,690
wasn't actually chosen just for its

309
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:40,270
retro-gaming coolness where we were

310
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:42,579
actually trying to encourage a balanced

311
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:45,189
information security program

312
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:46,390
hence the you know defense and depth

313
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:48,279
strategy everything that we've all

314
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:52,029
learned but it sort of ties in really

315
00:10:48,279 --> 00:10:54,220
nicely with don't go it alone sorry what

316
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:55,360
does that mean for us it doesn't mean

317
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,800
that we're here to replace any

318
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,040
government departments or anything like

319
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,870
that

320
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,920
government agencies it doesn't mean

321
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,240
we're here to replace any of those

322
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,099
vendors out there

323
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,730
it's quite different we're actually very

324
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:08,170
passionate about delivering world-class

325
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:10,149
cybersecurity services that are unique

326
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:12,670
and we want to do it at a not-for-profit

327
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:16,119
rate so that's why we're all here that's

328
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:17,378
why everyone works in awe cert the we're

329
00:11:16,119 --> 00:11:18,999
actually at the moment we're very

330
00:11:17,379 --> 00:11:20,679
excited about planning what we're doing

331
00:11:18,999 --> 00:11:23,529
next year so you know you've got to look

332
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:25,899
at it so what we really want from you

333
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:28,029
from our members is we want you to come

334
00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:29,920
and visit our booth so our booth is sort

335
00:11:28,029 --> 00:11:32,410
of at the intersection of the two aisle

336
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,449
ways and throughout the whole conference

337
00:11:32,410 --> 00:11:36,429
the next two days and our wonderful

338
00:11:34,449 --> 00:11:38,769
membership team Nick and Megan will be

339
00:11:36,429 --> 00:11:40,800
there so they've actually got a short

340
00:11:38,769 --> 00:11:44,230
survey that we would really like you to

341
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,699
to complete it's it's just asking you

342
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,709
know what are you using in our services

343
00:11:45,699 --> 00:11:49,660
what do you want from our services going

344
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:51,300
forward so we'd really love it if you

345
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:54,850
could if you could participate in that

346
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,859
during the breaks also our analysts will

347
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:58,269
be at the stand so if you want to

348
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,069
actually talk to any of the analysts

349
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:03,550
just come and find us at morning tea

350
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:06,969
afternoon tea and lunch um ok speaking

351
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:09,519
of our members we're actually really

352
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:11,049
proud to say that and quite a number of

353
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,119
our members have been able to integrate

354
00:12:11,049 --> 00:12:14,920
our services into their business

355
00:12:13,119 --> 00:12:16,569
processes that's what this is all about

356
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:18,128
obviously it's not just technology

357
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,649
anymore with as David said we've got to

358
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:23,709
think of people process technology so

359
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:26,019
one of the examples of that is the

360
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:28,329
information sharing and analysis centre

361
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:31,449
that we we've operated now for a little

362
00:12:28,329 --> 00:12:34,508
while for the universities we actually

363
00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:37,479
just got a finalist at status in the

364
00:12:34,509 --> 00:12:39,910
quarter Awards last week for that we're

365
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:42,670
extremely proud of Nick's oysters one of

366
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:44,139
our senior analysts who's who heads up

367
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,799
that AIESEC but we're really proud of

368
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:46,480
the whole team

369
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,220
because to actually get that recognition

370
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,319
for that Isaac was just wonderful

371
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:52,299
and the Victorian Government had already

372
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:54,279
put all of all of our membership

373
00:12:52,299 --> 00:12:55,720
services into their business processes

374
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:57,879
for their information security

375
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,350
management program but the next thing

376
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:02,019
they did is they've rolled out our new

377
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,910
training across all of their state

378
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:05,559
departments so that everyone can benefit

379
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:08,799
from all sets expertise and we were

380
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:10,299
really excited about that too um so I

381
00:13:08,799 --> 00:13:12,129
suppose it's really good to see that

382
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:13,569
it's it isn't just about the tech

383
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:15,010
anymore it is about the people and

384
00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:16,750
that's where that training

385
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,980
all right so that brings me to something

386
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,690
I've been really looking forward to

387
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:21,580
doing and that is launching a whole lot

388
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:23,380
of new products so david has already

389
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:26,500
hinted out it I just hinted at it we're

390
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:28,330
now doing training again so what we're

391
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,310
going to do is over the next month or so

392
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:31,360
we'll launch that officially and we'll

393
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,829
get all the information out to our

394
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,450
members about the courses that we're

395
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:37,030
offering so there's things like

396
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:38,980
obviously Incident Response that's kind

397
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:40,990
of a cert teams bread-and-butter so

398
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,670
we're obviously very keen to impart our

399
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:45,070
knowledge on that but we've also done

400
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:47,709
some courses on planning your Incident

401
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:49,750
Response now that's that might sound

402
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:51,040
like a bit of an overlap but it's

403
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,800
actually not you've got to plan these

404
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,050
things in advance so those courses will

405
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,719
be announced really really soon

406
00:13:56,050 --> 00:14:00,130
so over the next month or so um the next

407
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,110
thing I wanted to announce is something

408
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:04,510
that we've all been very excited about

409
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:06,220
internally and we've got a few of you on

410
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,280
the pilot for this and that's our AUSA

411
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:10,870
at daily intelligence report I found

412
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:13,569
before I worked in also where I was

413
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:14,950
surrounded by analysts that know

414
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:17,830
everything that's going on all the time

415
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:19,090
in cybersecurity news I felt like when I

416
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:20,650
worked in a bank I felt like I was in a

417
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:22,870
bit of a vacuum I didn't really know

418
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:24,189
what was going on in the world so it was

419
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,290
really refreshing to see all the

420
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:28,360
analysts talking about all these infoset

421
00:14:26,290 --> 00:14:29,560
news articles and we sort of looked at

422
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,210
that and we went well and members

423
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:33,069
probably want to hear that too so it's

424
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:34,870
now a daily report that you can

425
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:36,070
subscribe to in a couple of weeks you'll

426
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:38,170
just be able to switch it on in our

427
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:39,730
member portal at the moment if you want

428
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,930
to enable it immediately if you can't

429
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,550
wait for that you can just see our

430
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:45,010
membership team and they'll turn it on

431
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:47,620
in your in your email subscriptions and

432
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:49,600
it's just a daily report of some curated

433
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,610
news articles that our analysts thought

434
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:54,220
would be relevant to you so that was

435
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:56,380
exciting and the very last thing I want

436
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:58,600
to mention I mentioned we're doing a

437
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,760
nice sack for the universities so the I

438
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:03,160
sack is information sharing and analysis

439
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:06,069
center that was something that we stole

440
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,449
from the US a lot of a lot of good ideas

441
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:09,100
come from there in the cybersecurity

442
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:12,190
space and they're miles ahead of us so

443
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,750
we we've actually used we've got it done

444
00:15:12,190 --> 00:15:15,820
done a little bit differently we are

445
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:17,350
using Mis for the technology behind that

446
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,670
and those of you that have looked at the

447
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,980
program you'll notice that we've

448
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:24,040
actually got the guys from circle which

449
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:25,870
is the team that writes the the software

450
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,280
behind Mis we've actually got them here

451
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:28,990
at the conference again there's a cup

452
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,910
here did some tutorials in the last

453
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:32,620
couple of days and there's presentations

454
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,060
today and tomorrow from them as well so

455
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:36,250
we wanted to be able to get that

456
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,469
expertise out to you so that you can

457
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:40,780
learn from it but most importantly we're

458
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:42,850
actually going to for all of our members

459
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:45,130
we're going to launch the Miss Purvis so

460
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:47,860
that you can subscribe to it and you can

461
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:49,750
receive the giant flow of indicators of

462
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:51,820
compromise that that comes out of a miss

463
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:54,310
feed so over the next couple of weeks

464
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,480
we'll announce we do have to charge you

465
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:57,939
for that I said that we're

466
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:59,350
not-for-profit but it obviously there's

467
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:01,420
that there's an internal cost to us to

468
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:04,810
producing that information it's a very

469
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:07,930
highly focused curated high confidence

470
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:10,180
feed of information and that obviously

471
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:11,920
doesn't come for free so we'll announce

472
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,810
what the pricing is for that over the

473
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,060
next month or so and we're very very

474
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:19,420
excited about launching these three new

475
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:22,300
products so I'm going to stop talking

476
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:23,620
now and hand back to dr. David we're

477
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,420
going to go a little bit further through

478
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:32,050
the journey of people process technology

479
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:33,910
thank you everyone thank you very much

480
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:35,920
Mike is really exciting I feel very M

481
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:38,110
very lucky to be director of ah cert but

482
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,270
I'm quite fortunate also to have to foot

483
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:42,280
into in or two feet in different camps

484
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:44,079
all cert is part of the University of

485
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:46,810
Queensland but I also have a role within

486
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:49,660
the University Queensland so the theme

487
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:51,040
not going alone what is also doing for

488
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,719
you well we've covered some of that

489
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,400
there's some of that that stuff today

490
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,860
with our process of people processes and

491
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,689
technology but it's not just about what

492
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:59,950
University what L cert is doing it's

493
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:01,690
also about what the University of

494
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:03,700
Queensland is also going to do and it's

495
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:06,069
my great pleasure to invite professor

496
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:08,020
Ryan Coe the chair and the director of

497
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:10,180
UQ cyber security to the stage to talk

498
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:13,260
about the up-and-coming cyber security

499
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:13,260
initiative thank you

500
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:23,800
I'm very good morning to you I it's an

501
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:25,899
honor to be here amongst all the

502
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,909
cybersecurity experts here I want to

503
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:31,840
find out how many of you are from the

504
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:36,100
industry can you raise your hands and

505
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:38,110
how many are from the government and how

506
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:43,810
many of you are currently not away and

507
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:48,100
need some coffee right now yeah I'm very

508
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:50,830
honored to actually be part of this UQ

509
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:53,620
cybersecurity program the whole goal of

510
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:55,659
this UQ cybersecurity program is that in

511
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:57,909
a few years time all of you who have

512
00:17:55,660 --> 00:18:00,460
raised your hands are gonna be part of

513
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:02,410
this UQ cybersecurity Network why am I

514
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:06,180
saying that it's because one of the

515
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:09,760
problems is that we always have industry

516
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:12,460
academic research and education and

517
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:16,180
training in silos or in different parts

518
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:17,470
of the ecosystem and one of the

519
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:20,170
challenges is actually to bring them

520
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:21,610
together so as you can see from from

521
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:24,580
this perspective the University of

522
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:26,260
Queensland has invested in programme

523
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:30,790
which actually brings everyone together

524
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:34,140
asset and its members uqs IPS with its

525
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:36,159
sock the industry government and

526
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:38,850
international organizations like the

527
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:41,350
Interpol is owned East and so on

528
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:43,179
together with all the researchers from

529
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:47,260
our different faculties the engineering

530
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:51,460
architecture an IT faculty with the

531
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:54,879
school of IT EE the signs with the math

532
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:56,620
and physics you know the mathematicians

533
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,470
and the physicists who are working on a

534
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:02,590
quantum computing the post quantum

535
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:04,990
crypto and so on the humanities arts and

536
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:07,030
social science faculty who are working

537
00:19:04,990 --> 00:19:10,060
on the different social aspects and a

538
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:11,860
challenges of cyber security and the

539
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:14,830
Business Economics and law faculty

540
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:17,590
working on the business governance the

541
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:20,710
economical decision-making the legal

542
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:22,389
aspects of cybersecurity medicine coming

543
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:26,770
together to understand from the

544
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:28,059
psychology perspective even for the

545
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:30,489
health information

546
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:32,739
the data privacy and so on the Center

547
00:19:30,489 --> 00:19:36,700
for Policy futures covering the national

548
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:38,440
security and the policies and we have

549
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:41,249
the Institute for social science

550
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:44,349
research which supports the H a SS and

551
00:19:41,249 --> 00:19:46,719
also of course yeah coming together and

552
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:49,418
as Mike alluded to it's dangerous to go

553
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:51,429
alone and David as well mentioned that

554
00:19:49,419 --> 00:19:53,859
so we all coming together and together

555
00:19:51,429 --> 00:19:54,820
we've all set we are actually offering a

556
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:57,820
lot of continuing professional

557
00:19:54,820 --> 00:20:00,729
development courses a master's program

558
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:02,649
PhDs and so on so that's in a nutshell

559
00:20:00,729 --> 00:20:06,339
how we are proposing to work together

560
00:20:02,649 --> 00:20:10,629
and it is my dream at least to see all

561
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:13,119
of you as part of UQ cyber security if

562
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:16,658
you come by our booth you might get a UQ

563
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:20,158
cybersecurity sticker right so I'll see

564
00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:20,159
you at a booth then thank you very much

565
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:33,169
did I hear you right Ryan a free sticker

566
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:34,428
game on at the uq dis no no go there

567
00:20:33,169 --> 00:20:35,599
it's a fascinating initiative find out

568
00:20:34,429 --> 00:20:36,830
exactly what's going on speak to them

569
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:37,849
over the course of the next couple of

570
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,928
days now a people at the back we're

571
00:20:37,849 --> 00:20:40,639
about to have our first keynote if you

572
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:41,779
want to just come in subtly and find

573
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,969
there some great seats right down the

574
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:45,529
front here in particular while I'm doing

applause for Miko HIPAA turn thank you

591
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:32,178
and I'm good morning my name is Mick and

592
00:21:27,499 --> 00:21:36,529
yes I am a geek and a nerd and yes I do

593
00:21:32,179 --> 00:21:43,029
live in Helsinki which is in Finland

594
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:48,200
which is in Europe and I have been doing

595
00:21:43,029 --> 00:21:51,139
InfoSec all my life I'll be 50 years old

596
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:55,419
this year so that's a pretty long time

597
00:21:51,139 --> 00:21:55,418
to be working with computers securing

598
00:21:55,809 --> 00:22:00,229
but it's not just me which is turning 50

599
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:03,220
this year

600
00:22:00,229 --> 00:22:06,950
if you've read about the history of

601
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:12,139
ARPANET you do recall that the historic

602
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:14,690
first packets ever sent over ARPANET

603
00:22:12,139 --> 00:22:18,529
which then became the Internet were

604
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:21,039
locked by hand into this imb log book

605
00:22:18,529 --> 00:22:24,379
which has an entry on the 29th of

606
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:26,809
october 1969 saying that the first

607
00:22:24,379 --> 00:22:29,629
message was successfully sent from one

608
00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:32,658
machine to another on a network which

609
00:22:29,629 --> 00:22:33,830
then became what we today know as the

610
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:38,450
Internet

611
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:40,428
that's a pretty big deal now internet

612
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:43,909
obviously didn't become an overnight

613
00:22:40,429 --> 00:22:47,029
success it became the thing that we know

614
00:22:43,909 --> 00:22:49,159
today with utilities and applications

615
00:22:47,029 --> 00:22:52,190
that we could all use I guess most

616
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:54,049
importantly the web and the web isn't 50

617
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:57,139
years old the web is 30 years old

618
00:22:54,049 --> 00:22:58,759
although for most of us it's 25 years

619
00:22:57,139 --> 00:23:03,649
old because the web really became

620
00:22:58,759 --> 00:23:06,320
mainstream in 1994 1994 1995 I set up

621
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:10,039
the first web site for our company in

622
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:12,830
April 1994 and I remember that there

623
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:14,960
were 16 web sites in our country we were

624
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:18,678
website number 17 that's that's how

625
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:21,830
early days it was but the change from

626
00:23:18,679 --> 00:23:26,690
the web then was very very fast the

627
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:30,499
world changed the world changed during

628
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:35,600
our lifetime what Internet did was it

629
00:23:30,499 --> 00:23:41,239
took away borders borders distance and

630
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:44,149
geography disappeared disappeared in a

631
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:44,509
good way and well the reason why we're

632
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:48,109
here

633
00:23:44,509 --> 00:23:51,080
in a bad way now obviously we had

634
00:23:48,109 --> 00:23:54,320
computer security problems before the

635
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:56,439
Internet you know things spreading on

636
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,149
floppy disks you might remember these

637
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:01,909
what viruses which would infect boot

638
00:23:59,149 --> 00:24:03,799
sectors of 5 1/4 inch floppy disks for 3

639
00:24:01,909 --> 00:24:05,899
and 1/2 inch floppy disks and would go

640
00:24:03,799 --> 00:24:08,029
around the world as people would travel

641
00:24:05,899 --> 00:24:10,789
and physically carry these on themselves

642
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:12,889
those were a real problem but obviously

643
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:15,259
when you look at this speed of spreading

644
00:24:12,889 --> 00:24:16,998
in the hind side from those it's nothing

645
00:24:15,259 --> 00:24:18,950
to compare to what happened then when

646
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:21,139
email became commonplace and then

647
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:22,820
eventually web became such a big deal

648
00:24:21,139 --> 00:24:25,580
that we could have things like you know

649
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:30,168
exploit kids and phishing sites and

650
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:32,239
things like that and now the web and the

651
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:34,489
internet and applications and mobile

652
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:36,830
phones are such an integrated part of

653
00:24:34,489 --> 00:24:43,690
our everyday lives it's hard to remember

654
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:43,689
how it was so let's talk about Austria

655
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:50,860
couple of months ago I had a chat with a

656
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:53,860
colleague at the office a young guy

657
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:56,040
maybe 25 years old one of the young

658
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:58,389
coders we've recruited from University

659
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:01,389
who had just come back from a business

660
00:24:58,390 --> 00:25:02,980
trip in Vienna Austria and we chatted

661
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:05,680
about Austria and I mentioned to him

662
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:08,830
about this holiday that I took to

663
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:13,510
Austria when I was his age like around

664
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:16,360
1992 1993 me a couple of friends went to

665
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:19,450
Austria we rented a car we drove to the

666
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:21,699
Alps where we had pre booked a boat

667
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:23,980
which we rented that we went sailing on

668
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:30,280
a on a lake in the middle of the Alps

669
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:32,710
and then this young coder asked me how

670
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:35,649
did you actually do that like how did

671
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:38,650
you how did you plan all that how did

672
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:39,970
you find where you want to go how did

673
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:41,650
you rent the boat how did you rent the

674
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:44,020
car where did you find boat rental

675
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:47,050
places before the internet because this

676
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:51,090
was before the internet web wasn't there

677
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:55,060
and I was baffled I had no idea I

678
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:58,120
absolutely couldn't recall how how we

679
00:25:55,060 --> 00:26:01,990
did this before the internet but we did

680
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:03,719
I really had to like think back and try

681
00:26:01,990 --> 00:26:07,420
to remember like how did things work

682
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:10,180
before the internet hug and III guess I

683
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:12,400
called international dialer systems

684
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:14,320
which is a number that you use to call

685
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,630
where there was a lady with phone books

686
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:18,159
for different countries and you would

687
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:19,810
ask her that hey I'm looking for boat

688
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,720
rental places in Austria and she would

689
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:24,220
pick Austrian yellow pages and tried to

690
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,720
find things and give you numbers and

691
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:29,320
then you would call those places with my

692
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,610
school German to pre book a boat and

693
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,830
then of course when we rented the car

694
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:35,379
there is no GPS there is no mobile phone

695
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:39,780
it seems like ancient history and this

696
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:41,410
is 25 years ago world is changing fast

697
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:45,340
changing for the better

698
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:48,910
mostly but also in some ways changing

699
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:51,129
for the worst before the Internet we

700
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:55,500
only had to worry about the criminals

701
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:57,850
who were living close to us that's it

702
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,149
now we have to worry about criminals who

703
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,579
can

704
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:02,978
anywhere on the planet that's the

705
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:05,139
downside now don't get me wrong there's

706
00:27:02,979 --> 00:27:08,109
much more good upsides and downsides

707
00:27:05,139 --> 00:27:10,958
that the Internet has brought us but it

708
00:27:08,109 --> 00:27:15,188
has changed for the first time the risk

709
00:27:10,959 --> 00:27:16,929
ratio of an average person that he's now

710
00:27:15,189 --> 00:27:20,799
more likely to become a victim of a

711
00:27:16,929 --> 00:27:23,979
crime in the online world than the real

712
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:26,639
world and that's a pretty big shift and

713
00:27:23,979 --> 00:27:31,809
it's happening right now

714
00:27:26,639 --> 00:27:35,498
so one thing that I keep wondering about

715
00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:37,989
myself is that after all the lessons

716
00:27:35,499 --> 00:27:41,259
that we've learned in computer security

717
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:43,629
about about how to make better and more

718
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:46,689
secure systems how to build security at

719
00:27:43,629 --> 00:27:50,789
every layer of new developments how come

720
00:27:46,689 --> 00:27:55,209
we keep repeating the same mistakes over

721
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:56,589
and over again in many ways when you

722
00:27:55,209 --> 00:27:58,509
look at some computer security

723
00:27:56,589 --> 00:28:01,389
everything old is new again we keep

724
00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:03,759
running into the same problems let me

725
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:09,129
give you an example this is the AIDS

726
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:13,269
information Trojan from 1989 1980s I ran

727
00:28:09,129 --> 00:28:14,529
some trojan from 1980s for real yes this

728
00:28:13,269 --> 00:28:16,389
was around some trojan it was

729
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:18,789
distributed on a floppy because internet

730
00:28:16,389 --> 00:28:20,049
didn't exist people were mailed this

731
00:28:18,789 --> 00:28:22,959
floppy which claimed to be a useful

732
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:25,059
application when you installed it after

733
00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:26,999
a couple of days it would encrypt the

734
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:31,109
hard drive and show you a ransom note

735
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:34,599
like this in 1989

736
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:36,849
compare that to petia which is one of

737
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:39,069
the most well known current ransom

738
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:42,129
trojan it's almost exactly the same

739
00:28:39,069 --> 00:28:44,379
thing except of course in 1989 it wasn't

740
00:28:42,129 --> 00:28:48,359
asking for Bitcoin was asking you to do

741
00:28:44,379 --> 00:28:50,918
a wire transfer to a P o box in Panama

742
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:54,369
nevertheless everything old is new again

743
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:58,959
another example many of you remember

744
00:28:54,369 --> 00:29:02,889
macro viruses 1999 2000 2001 a

745
00:28:58,959 --> 00:29:04,899
love-letter nuclear Leroux infecting

746
00:29:02,889 --> 00:29:08,549
Word Excel PowerPoint spreading over

747
00:29:04,899 --> 00:29:11,498
macros we got rid of this problem

748
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:14,649
because Microsoft changed the way

749
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:17,649
Microsoft Office works they disabled

750
00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:19,958
macros by default to get rid of the

751
00:29:17,649 --> 00:29:23,948
macro virus problem they did this in

752
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:26,559
Microsoft Office 2003 long time ago 16

753
00:29:23,949 --> 00:29:29,109
years ago and now when we look at the

754
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:32,379
problems we're seeing today we're seeing

755
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:34,658
macro viruses or macro malware again and

756
00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:37,539
the same default setting that was

757
00:29:34,659 --> 00:29:39,999
changed in 2003 is still there macros

758
00:29:37,539 --> 00:29:43,419
are disabled by default which means

759
00:29:39,999 --> 00:29:46,419
today the attacks try to trick you in to

760
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:49,269
clicking the most dangerous button that

761
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:51,609
you have in Microsoft Office the enable

762
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:54,189
content button which is the button that

763
00:29:51,609 --> 00:29:56,259
they introduced in 2003 if there are

764
00:29:54,189 --> 00:29:59,199
macros in the file you open they are

765
00:29:56,259 --> 00:30:01,209
disabled but they will helpfully prompt

766
00:29:59,199 --> 00:30:04,209
you if you might want to enable them

767
00:30:01,209 --> 00:30:05,679
anyway and now then the attacks are

768
00:30:04,209 --> 00:30:09,219
trying to trick you in to clicking that

769
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:13,689
button which sounds pretty innocent it's

770
00:30:09,219 --> 00:30:15,939
enabling content so I have friends who

771
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:18,489
work at Microsoft actually I have

772
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:21,399
friends who work in the Microsoft of his

773
00:30:18,489 --> 00:30:22,589
team and I've told them that they should

774
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:29,889
rename the button

775
00:30:22,589 --> 00:30:32,769
to infect my system because then maybe

776
00:30:29,889 --> 00:30:35,289
then people wouldn't be so keen on

777
00:30:32,769 --> 00:30:37,029
clicking on that so yes everything old

778
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:41,729
is new york and we keep repeating the

779
00:30:37,029 --> 00:30:41,729
same mistakes another example telnet

780
00:30:42,929 --> 00:30:46,779
unencrypted terminal connection from one

781
00:30:45,069 --> 00:30:48,849
machine to another with me which means

782
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:51,249
anybody who's watching the traffic sees

783
00:30:48,849 --> 00:30:52,809
everything it's unencrypted so if you're

784
00:30:51,249 --> 00:30:54,429
doing the telnet session over Wi-Fi

785
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:56,589
anybody who's there will get your

786
00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:58,479
passwords at whatever you type such a

787
00:30:56,589 --> 00:31:03,639
horrible bad idea we got rid of telnet

788
00:30:58,479 --> 00:31:05,769
in the 1990s and now when you look where

789
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:08,619
we are today with this brave new world

790
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:11,679
of Internet of Things and connected

791
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:14,559
devices for some reason that I cannot

792
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,419
explain we are reintroducing telnet as a

793
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,158
service on these devices most of which

794
00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:20,019
are running line up so they are UNIX

795
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:24,410
systems same kind of systems which we

796
00:31:20,019 --> 00:31:27,170
got rid of telnet D in 1995 or 19

797
00:31:24,410 --> 00:31:30,620
seven when we look at the botnets that

798
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:32,900
we are now seeing which only infect IOT

799
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:36,199
devices which refuse to infect real

800
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:39,410
computers many of those are using telnet

801
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:42,590
as the way in most famously Mirai which

802
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:45,620
actually has a built-in built-in list of

803
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:47,629
telnet usernames and passwords it tries

804
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:50,510
to gain access like admin admin support

805
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:55,310
support root root all my favorite mother

806
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:57,170
 I don't really know why tries

807
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:59,389
logging in as mother and password ass

808
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:01,130
but it does maybe there is a system

809
00:31:59,390 --> 00:32:04,880
somewhere which this is the default

810
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:09,070
password so yes we keep repeating the

811
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:15,070
same mistakes and to make this harder

812
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:21,950
when we when we succeed in our work

813
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:24,590
nothing happens that's a pretty pretty

814
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:28,280
big downer actually when we are

815
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:32,090
successful nothing happens like if you

816
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:34,460
do your job right your company and your

817
00:32:32,090 --> 00:32:36,439
clients will not be on the cover of the

818
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:39,410
newspaper tomorrow because there never

819
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:40,640
is a newspaper which would have

820
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:42,770
headlined that you know the biggest

821
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,820
company in Australia was not hacked

822
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:48,980
yesterday that's not news and I

823
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:51,580
sometimes end up in these questions over

824
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:54,940
this because I I do a lot of meetings

825
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:57,590
with f-secure clients and customers

826
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:59,060
typically you know board meetings or

827
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:03,260
leadership team meetings and it's

828
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:07,010
typically the CFO who looks at the

829
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:09,430
figures and he's like we're paying you

830
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:14,270
guys it says here we're paying you guys

831
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:16,550
50000 euros a year why are we paying you

832
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:21,889
guys 50000 euros a year we have no

833
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:24,290
security problems and what I typically

834
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:29,510
reply with is that well you know what

835
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:31,700
mr. CFO it's awfully clean here in your

836
00:33:29,510 --> 00:33:33,530
boardroom why don't you fire all your

837
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:36,110
cleaners and janitors clearly you don't

838
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:38,389
need them so where do we do our jobs

839
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:45,790
right we're invisible

840
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:49,130
but when we fail it is very visible and

841
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:51,620
today as more and more of our systems

842
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:55,190
and services are moving from traditional

843
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:56,870
on-prem systems into the cloud this is

844
00:33:55,190 --> 00:34:02,210
becoming more and more important because

845
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:05,419
we are becoming service providers every

846
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:08,630
company already became a software

847
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:10,760
company five years ago that's old news

848
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:13,550
every company is a software company your

849
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:16,550
company regardless of what you do is a

850
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:18,290
software company what's happening now is

851
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:20,660
that every company is becoming a

852
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:22,820
software service provider we are

853
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:27,920
becoming cloud providers for our

854
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:30,980
customers and that means that when we

855
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:33,230
fail it's not just that we have problems

856
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:36,290
internally it's that our clients and

857
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:39,409
customers have problems and we have

858
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:41,360
plenty of examples of this happening in

859
00:34:39,409 --> 00:34:45,139
different countries over and over again

860
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:47,990
plenty of examples from this year where

861
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:50,389
service providers or software as a

862
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:52,129
service providers are unable to provide

863
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:54,379
the service because their cloud

864
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:59,180
instances have been wiped by a

865
00:34:54,380 --> 00:35:01,400
ransomware Trojan which got in because a

866
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:04,940
clerk in the financial department

867
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:07,760
clicked on an Excel attachment they got

868
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:11,570
over email and I'll tell you what that's

869
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:13,670
no longer good enough the fact that

870
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:16,190
someone opened a bad spreadsheet should

871
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:18,320
never be the reason that your customers

872
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:20,540
can't work but that's exactly what has

873
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,810
happened over and over again over the

874
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:27,980
last months

875
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:30,380
we're becoming service providers and it

876
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:33,380
is a game of cat and mouse whatever new

877
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:36,230
safety precautions we are implementing

878
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:40,370
the attackers are watching and trying to

879
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:43,460
figure out ways to get around them so

880
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:46,850
things like moving our email servers

881
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:50,660
from our old hosted servers into cloud

882
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:51,549
let's say office 365 only means that the

883
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:54,100
attacker

884
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:59,040
we'll follow from the on-prem systems

885
00:35:54,100 --> 00:36:02,020
into the cloud systems so we introduce

886
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:05,320
new safety precautions like two-factor

887
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:07,540
authentication with SMS based earth or

888
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:10,390
even better application or Authenticator

889
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:13,509
based authentication and the attackers

890
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:15,400
will follow let's have a look at a real

891
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:18,880
attack from not too long ago a couple of

892
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:20,350
weeks ago you get an email a file has

893
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,060
been shared with you please follow the

894
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:23,470
link you follow the link you end up in

895
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:25,390
onedrive which is where you have files

896
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:28,080
anyway because your organization is

897
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:30,310
running office 365 and it asks you to

898
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,870
authenticate to gain access to the file

899
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:33,310
and also you take a look at the URL

900
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:35,470
because that's what you've been trained

901
00:36:33,310 --> 00:36:38,680
to do and there is the lock alright

902
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:41,290
great but you know that the lock itself

903
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:44,259
isn't good enough but then you look at

904
00:36:41,290 --> 00:36:47,350
the URL and it is office.com which is a

905
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:53,170
Microsoft domain and this is a Microsoft

906
00:36:47,350 --> 00:36:55,450
login it's asking for your username it's

907
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:57,820
asking for your password now obviously

908
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:58,899
it's a phishing site because forms that

909
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:01,390
office.com

910
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:03,540
is a forms hosting site where anybody

911
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:07,330
can create forms like a4 which says

912
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:10,120
onedrive sign-in to continue please give

913
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:12,370
your username but beyond that it's also

914
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:15,279
a man-in-the-middle attack because when

915
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:16,690
you give this form a real username and

916
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,060
real password it will take them and

917
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:23,140
immediately use them to login for the

918
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:26,009
real office 365 which then triggers the

919
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:31,120
real office 365 server triggers a

920
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:34,600
two-factor authentication query and this

921
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:36,759
of course means that the real user gets

922
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:39,910
a real notification on the real device

923
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:41,890
which makes perfect sense because he or

924
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:43,779
she is really logging into a service or

925
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:47,200
so they believe so they will of course

926
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:53,200
punch in the code that they just

927
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:57,129
received an attack like these are hard

928
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:59,080
to find as long as we keep using

929
00:37:57,130 --> 00:38:01,870
authentication mechanisms which are

930
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:04,670
relying on the users being able to tell

931
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:08,410
the difference between a real URL or a

932
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:11,779
URL when URLs can look so confusing

933
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:14,720
office.com it's hard to tell your users

934
00:38:11,779 --> 00:38:22,460
that don't trust content from office.com

935
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:26,689
is it and yes everything is becoming a

936
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:30,460
computer if it uses electricity it will

937
00:38:26,690 --> 00:38:34,819
become a computer I'm not worried about

938
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:36,799
IOT revolution of smart devices that

939
00:38:34,819 --> 00:38:41,480
doesn't worry me at all what I am

940
00:38:36,799 --> 00:38:44,059
worried about is stupid devices stupid

941
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:47,180
device is going to the Internet and this

942
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:50,420
hasn't happened yet we have right now a

943
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:55,848
revolution where you go and buy a smart

944
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:59,240
watch a smart whore smart TV and when

945
00:38:55,849 --> 00:39:02,029
you as a consumer buy those things you

946
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:03,859
know that they are on the internet

947
00:39:02,029 --> 00:39:06,680
that's why you bought them you bought

948
00:39:03,859 --> 00:39:09,078
the Smart TV so you could watch Netflix

949
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,618
on the TV it's obvious that it's on the

950
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:12,829
Internet

951
00:39:09,619 --> 00:39:14,289
you know that it's on the Internet but

952
00:39:12,829 --> 00:39:17,240
in the near future

953
00:39:14,289 --> 00:39:20,359
stupid devices will go on the Internet

954
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:22,220
as well and you have no idea that they

955
00:39:20,359 --> 00:39:24,160
are on the internet because they will

956
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:27,680
not be going to the Internet to provide

957
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,930
new features and services to you the

958
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,538
consumer they will be going to the

959
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:37,700
Internet to provide benefits to the

960
00:39:32,539 --> 00:39:39,529
manufacturer so simple simple stupid

961
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:41,210
household items will be going to the

962
00:39:39,529 --> 00:39:43,400
Internet just for the reason that the

963
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:46,519
manufacturers want to know where their

964
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:50,200
clients are how often do they use these

965
00:39:46,519 --> 00:39:53,779
devices how often do they have failures

966
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:56,930
which means when you go and buy devices

967
00:39:53,779 --> 00:39:58,460
in the future you are not even told that

968
00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:00,230
they are going to go to the Internet and

969
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:02,660
they will not be going to the Internet

970
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:04,069
using a Wi-Fi connection that you could

971
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:07,038
block they will be going to the internet

972
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:10,759
using 5g or Zig fox or something that

973
00:40:07,039 --> 00:40:13,039
you can't block then there's nothing we

974
00:40:10,759 --> 00:40:13,940
can do to prevent this this revolution

975
00:40:13,039 --> 00:40:18,140
is already underway

976
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:20,119
you can't stop this revolution from

977
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:22,999
refusing to play part because you will

978
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:25,009
play part you won't even know which of

979
00:40:22,999 --> 00:40:25,549
the devices you will buy will be on the

980
00:40:25,009 --> 00:40:27,440
Internet

981
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:30,259
this revolution hasn't gone through yet

982
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:33,349
because it's still too expensive to add

983
00:40:30,259 --> 00:40:34,130
an IOT chipset or Anna SiC Fox chips at

984
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:36,230
anime well

985
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:38,329
eventually a 5g modem into every device

986
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:41,720
but as you know technology becomes

987
00:40:38,329 --> 00:40:44,329
cheaper and cheaper in ten years it's

988
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:48,529
going to be so cheap connectivity can be

989
00:40:44,329 --> 00:40:50,839
put into anything and then it will and

990
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:55,069
this revolution has been a long time

991
00:40:50,839 --> 00:41:00,069
coming IOT and connected devices really

992
00:40:55,069 --> 00:41:02,749
started from factories and plants

993
00:41:00,069 --> 00:41:04,640
factory automation companies started

994
00:41:02,749 --> 00:41:06,499
building plant automation systems

995
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:12,759
computerized plant automation systems

996
00:41:06,499 --> 00:41:16,488
already in the 1980s today every factory

997
00:41:12,759 --> 00:41:18,349
every plant every power plant every

998
00:41:16,489 --> 00:41:21,819
nuclear power plant every food

999
00:41:18,349 --> 00:41:25,460
processing plant runs on computers our

1000
00:41:21,819 --> 00:41:29,180
society runs some computers now we got

1001
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:33,140
an excellent reminder of this 7 weeks

1002
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:35,868
ago in this facility which belongs to

1003
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:38,900
North Kudrow which is the second largest

1004
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:41,359
company in Norway one of the largest

1005
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:43,450
aluminum manufacturers in the world with

1006
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:46,279
factories around the world including

1007
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:49,999
aluminum factories in Qatar and in

1008
00:41:46,279 --> 00:41:51,799
Brazil and on the Tuesday morning seven

1009
00:41:49,999 --> 00:41:54,379
weeks ago when employees got to their

1010
00:41:51,799 --> 00:41:57,140
office there was a handwritten note at

1011
00:41:54,380 --> 00:42:01,249
every office door which says do not turn

1012
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:03,259
on your computer there's a note at the

1013
00:42:01,249 --> 00:42:05,808
bottom which has an added note an hour

1014
00:42:03,259 --> 00:42:09,710
later that it's ok to turn on your phone

1015
00:42:05,809 --> 00:42:12,619
but don't turn on your computer and the

1016
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:19,430
if this ever happens to you this is a

1017
00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:23,089
bad sign this was Locker Goga there's

1018
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:25,940
two similar gangs going or going around

1019
00:42:23,089 --> 00:42:29,779
now we'd run some trojans local Goga and

1020
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:30,940
make a cortex these ransom Trojans are

1021
00:42:29,779 --> 00:42:33,430
different

1022
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:36,609
from the ones we used to know like

1023
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:38,950
crypto wall and cryptolocker or wanna

1024
00:42:36,609 --> 00:42:42,640
cryin petia because these things do not

1025
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:46,629
spread they're not worms they're not

1026
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:49,480
viruses they are targeted the attackers

1027
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:51,910
the gangs will pick a company then they

1028
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:54,609
start scanning the perimeter trying to

1029
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:59,140
find ways in typically looking for VP

1030
00:42:54,609 --> 00:43:02,920
and end points or OWA sites or some way

1031
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:05,259
in and once they gain access then they

1032
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:08,950
use lateral movement trying to gain

1033
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:11,200
access to everything going from one data

1034
00:43:08,950 --> 00:43:14,230
center to another and once they are

1035
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,419
happy with the level of access they have

1036
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:18,579
once they believe that they can destroy

1037
00:43:16,420 --> 00:43:21,880
everything in one go that's what they do

1038
00:43:18,579 --> 00:43:24,430
in this case in the middle of the night

1039
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:26,859
between Monday and Tuesday all the data

1040
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:29,919
centers went down they were wiped with a

1041
00:43:26,859 --> 00:43:32,500
very fast encryption algorithm which

1042
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,430
tried deleting everything or encrypting

1043
00:43:32,500 --> 00:43:40,089
everything and then when they were done

1044
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:42,450
they were not asking for Bitcoin no they

1045
00:43:40,089 --> 00:43:46,980
simply left their contact information

1046
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:52,569
here's our email please get in touch

1047
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:54,490
let's negotiate that's what they do and

1048
00:43:52,569 --> 00:43:57,220
this is a different beast this is a

1049
00:43:54,490 --> 00:44:01,058
different kind of a problem than the

1050
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:06,160
traditional random malware which would

1051
00:44:01,059 --> 00:44:08,319
then use encryption mechanisms to strike

1052
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,640
and run some trojan attack against your

1053
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:13,450
organization's because these are

1054
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:17,109
targeted and they're ransomed roche and

1055
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:20,078
problem really plays on a very old idea

1056
00:44:17,109 --> 00:44:23,500
that we've seen for years and years with

1057
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:26,289
cyber criminals the old idea that you

1058
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:29,349
steal information and then you sell that

1059
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:31,059
information to the highest bidder this

1060
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:33,730
is what cyber criminals have been doing

1061
00:44:31,059 --> 00:44:36,430
for years and years well it's exactly

1062
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:39,400
the same idea in ransom Trojans it's

1063
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:42,430
just that the attackers realized that in

1064
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:43,910
many cases the highest bidder is the

1065
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,799
victim themselves

1066
00:44:43,910 --> 00:44:49,038
they are willing to pay more for the

1067
00:44:45,799 --> 00:44:50,509
data than anyone else so if you can

1068
00:44:49,039 --> 00:44:53,480
destroy the data and make sure they

1069
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:57,369
can't restore it or recover in a timely

1070
00:44:53,480 --> 00:45:01,640
fashion they will pay you the ransom and

1071
00:44:57,369 --> 00:45:03,349
when this hit the news initially it

1072
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:05,509
looked really really worrying because

1073
00:45:03,349 --> 00:45:06,920
this is aluminum manufacturing and if

1074
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:08,539
you know anything about aluminum

1075
00:45:06,920 --> 00:45:11,960
manufacturing and I didn't know anything

1076
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:15,260
about it before this these factories are

1077
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:16,730
very very fragile they run 24 hours a

1078
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:18,589
day basically you build an aluminum

1079
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:21,920
factory you boot it up and then it never

1080
00:45:18,589 --> 00:45:24,109
stops because if you have to stop it you

1081
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:26,470
will lose the factory Halloween melts in

1082
00:45:24,109 --> 00:45:28,549
and you will never be able to recover it

1083
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:30,379
sounds like theoretical this has

1084
00:45:28,549 --> 00:45:32,780
actually happened the last time this has

1085
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:34,490
happened it was in February in Venezuela

1086
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:36,829
as government of Venezuela has been

1087
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:38,629
having extended power cuts after which

1088
00:45:36,829 --> 00:45:40,280
as a result of which they lost all of

1089
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:42,470
their aluminum factories and they will

1090
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:48,130
be without any capability to make any

1091
00:45:42,470 --> 00:45:54,500
aluminium for at least a year however

1092
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:57,079
with this company it didn't happen we

1093
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:58,720
know that they had to take all of their

1094
00:45:57,079 --> 00:46:01,819
computing systems offline

1095
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:04,069
including the PLC's controlling their

1096
00:46:01,819 --> 00:46:06,799
factories but they didn't lose a single

1097
00:46:04,069 --> 00:46:10,579
factory they were able to keep every

1098
00:46:06,799 --> 00:46:14,690
factory operating without computers how

1099
00:46:10,579 --> 00:46:16,609
the hell did you do that how on earth do

1100
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:18,440
you keep a modern factory running

1101
00:46:16,609 --> 00:46:20,299
without computers well the answer is

1102
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:27,049
they were able to do it because they

1103
00:46:20,299 --> 00:46:30,579
still had these you know old farts who

1104
00:46:27,049 --> 00:46:30,579
remember how it used to be

1105
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:39,600
basically guys like me basically guys

1106
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:42,600
like me who travels the world carrying

1107
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:44,190
floppy disks and punch cards you may

1108
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:47,339
remember these these how we used to

1109
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:52,190
store information run a punch card here

1110
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:56,670
we go ditched a cheap cheap thank you

1111
00:46:52,190 --> 00:47:00,480
don't put them on eBay so these guys

1112
00:46:56,670 --> 00:47:04,020
still remembered how it used to be how

1113
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,540
factories used to operate before we had

1114
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:09,420
PLC's before we had computers who still

1115
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:12,840
had binders full of papers with

1116
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:15,030
calculations and numbers this is what

1117
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:17,820
saved these particular factories now the

1118
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:23,310
question is how much longer we'll be

1119
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:27,150
able to do this five years ten years not

1120
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:29,490
much longer and everything is becoming a

1121
00:47:27,150 --> 00:47:32,480
computer everything turns into a

1122
00:47:29,490 --> 00:47:34,950
computer and some of these devices that

1123
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:37,740
are turning into computers have very

1124
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:40,470
very long life cycles I think a prime

1125
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:44,459
example is cars you look look at the car

1126
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:47,250
that you would buy today clearly it's a

1127
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:51,540
computer modern car is a data center of

1128
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:53,640
four wheels so how long is that new car

1129
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:57,029
did you buy today going to be on the

1130
00:47:53,640 --> 00:48:00,180
roads if it's not crashed it's gonna be

1131
00:47:57,030 --> 00:48:05,910
on the roads for I don't know 20 30 40

1132
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:08,040
years 50 years maybe maybe I'm right now

1133
00:48:05,910 --> 00:48:09,899
driving a 19 year old car I plan on

1134
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:12,750
driving it for at least 10 more years

1135
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:16,560
but as they are now cars then the

1136
00:48:12,750 --> 00:48:20,880
question becomes how long will these

1137
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:24,840
data centers be getting patches you know

1138
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:27,930
security patches so I asked my Twitter

1139
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:29,820
followers and the consensus was that car

1140
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:33,660
manufacturers should be providing

1141
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:38,250
patches for their cars for 25 years 25

1142
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:40,529
years right now nobody's providing

1143
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:42,720
security patches for anything for more

1144
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:43,560
than 15 years typically more than five

1145
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,560
years

1146
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:54,480
the only exception seems to be Windows

1147
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:56,610
XP which simply refuses to die and when

1148
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,400
we look at situation right now people

1149
00:48:56,610 --> 00:49:01,080
are really getting over-the-air updates

1150
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,910
to their cars as they're driving around

1151
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:06,060
but will they be getting the patches

1152
00:49:02,910 --> 00:49:07,740
when the car is 25 years old we really

1153
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:09,270
don't know we don't know if this is

1154
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:11,310
gonna be supportable everything is

1155
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:12,870
becoming a computer some of these things

1156
00:49:11,310 --> 00:49:15,090
have very long life cycles and we have

1157
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:16,950
no idea how the patches will be handled

1158
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:23,130
when the device is gonna be 20 30 40

1159
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:25,109
years old and we of course all know

1160
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:28,380
about the patching which is right now

1161
00:49:25,110 --> 00:49:32,730
under way for these seven three seven

1162
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:35,250
max 8 when the patches for these will be

1163
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:42,360
ready I wonder if they are also going to

1164
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:44,460
be over-the-air that is the sometimes we

1165
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:47,190
are developing new technology and we

1166
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:50,490
fall in love with the technology we

1167
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:52,230
innovate something great and we deploy

1168
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:56,790
and implement it everywhere

1169
00:49:52,230 --> 00:50:00,240
only to realize decades later there was

1170
00:49:56,790 --> 00:50:05,759
a horribly bad idea let me play you a TV

1171
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:07,169
ad from 1950s smart woman she's putting

1172
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,750
a new floor down by herself

1173
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:12,420
wise woman she's using ken tile vinyl

1174
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:14,640
asbestos tile easiest-going to install

1175
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:16,950
easy as flooring to care for say in

1176
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:19,770
every way with ken tile vinyl asbestos

1177
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:21,990
tile Kent I'll buy the less bestest

1178
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:24,600
tiles best idea ever

1179
00:50:21,990 --> 00:50:26,490
asbestos let's just put it everywhere

1180
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:29,580
like you know kitchen tiles and paint

1181
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:31,830
and insulation and pipes and whatever

1182
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:34,110
well as asbestos was a great idea it was

1183
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:37,830
a really remarkable really revolutionary

1184
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:40,380
material with great great benefits which

1185
00:50:37,830 --> 00:50:42,420
turned out to be a horribly bad idea and

1186
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:47,220
what's happening right now around us

1187
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:51,450
could eventually turn out to be IT as

1188
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:54,270
bestest yeah let's turn everything into

1189
00:50:51,450 --> 00:50:55,100
a computer let's put everything on the

1190
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:56,940
Internet

1191
00:50:55,100 --> 00:51:01,230
let's take these

1192
00:50:56,940 --> 00:51:05,520
horribly insecure IOT devices running

1193
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:07,710
Linux with a kernel from early 2000s and

1194
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:10,800
appeals in password which cannot be

1195
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:13,079
changed by the customer and just deploy

1196
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:17,310
them globally that's what we're doing

1197
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:19,140
today and in 10 15 20 years we'll be

1198
00:51:17,310 --> 00:51:21,359
looking back at these years and

1199
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:24,690
scratching our heads but what the hell

1200
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:26,940
were we thinking what we are creating

1201
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:28,560
right now could be the next big headache

1202
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:32,730
that we have to worry about for the

1203
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:38,509
upcoming decades our IT asbestos mark my

1204
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:41,670
word and then we have a totally

1205
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:43,440
different set of problems ahead of us in

1206
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:48,260
the future as we think about what's

1207
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:51,119
happening with governments now most

1208
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:54,510
organizations do not have to worry about

1209
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:58,680
governmental attacks but some

1210
00:51:54,510 --> 00:52:01,349
organizations do and by the way take a

1211
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:07,348
look at these guys March that's pretty

1212
00:52:01,349 --> 00:52:09,330
neat I've seen your military march it

1213
00:52:07,349 --> 00:52:14,640
doesn't look like this

1214
00:52:09,330 --> 00:52:18,360
it doesn't look like this at all so

1215
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:21,740
three weeks ago a lawyer in London got a

1216
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:21,740
phone call in the middle of the night

1217
00:52:21,950 --> 00:52:27,270
actually three calls mid missed calls

1218
00:52:24,690 --> 00:52:29,070
because he was asleep and the phone was

1219
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:31,410
silent when he woke up in the morning he

1220
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:34,500
pick up the phone an iPhone looked at it

1221
00:52:31,410 --> 00:52:37,080
and okay three missed calls from a phone

1222
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:39,060
number which starts with plus four six

1223
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:41,940
and that's the country code for Sweden

1224
00:52:39,060 --> 00:52:44,730
the lawyer was in London he's like weird

1225
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:50,300
and they weren't phone calls they were

1226
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:54,660
video calls video calls over whatsapp

1227
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:58,410
and those calls in the middle of the

1228
00:52:54,660 --> 00:53:01,560
night to a human rights lawyer in London

1229
00:52:58,410 --> 00:53:04,890
three weeks ago where the reason why you

1230
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:07,380
got a patch for your phones and the

1231
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:10,680
attack that was targeting that human

1232
00:53:07,380 --> 00:53:14,340
rights lawyer was launched by an Israeli

1233
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:16,950
company who was targeting well if not

1234
00:53:14,340 --> 00:53:20,390
mr. Jamel Khashoggi himself at least his

1235
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:23,100
personal friends after which this

1236
00:53:20,390 --> 00:53:29,670
journalist was brutally murdered by the

1237
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:32,279
Saudi Arabian government so why was this

1238
00:53:29,670 --> 00:53:35,070
company Israeli company targeting a

1239
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:38,010
human rights lawyer in London with

1240
00:53:35,070 --> 00:53:40,470
whatsapp zero-day vulnerability well

1241
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:42,870
because he was running civil litigation

1242
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:46,230
against the company from people who had

1243
00:53:42,870 --> 00:53:48,480
been targeted by rogue governments like

1244
00:53:46,230 --> 00:53:50,600
the Saudi government trying to gain

1245
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:54,960
access to their mobile phones with

1246
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:57,839
unknown exploits and cases like these

1247
00:53:54,960 --> 00:54:00,270
are rare and this was deployment with

1248
00:53:57,840 --> 00:54:03,600
zero day vulnerability our statistics on

1249
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:06,180
how many times during a year we see a

1250
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:07,890
real attack against real users using a

1251
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:09,810
zero day vulnerability there's like

1252
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:13,080
twenty or thirty attacks like that

1253
00:54:09,810 --> 00:54:16,640
every year it's it's rare because zero

1254
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:18,900
days are rare and zero days are valuable

1255
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:21,710
attackers don't like to use them because

1256
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,710
then you lose too

1257
00:54:22,269 --> 00:54:28,549
this particular attack means that all of

1258
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:31,039
us got a whatsapp update last week and

1259
00:54:28,549 --> 00:54:33,859
if you haven't updated your whatsapp you

1260
00:54:31,039 --> 00:54:35,000
should although it's not really obvious

1261
00:54:33,859 --> 00:54:36,710
why you should if you look at the

1262
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,150
release notes for the patch at PAX

1263
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:39,589
strict it doesn't speak anything about

1264
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:44,839
the zero day vulnerability speaks about

1265
00:54:39,589 --> 00:54:48,230
new stickers nevertheless update your

1266
00:54:44,839 --> 00:54:51,170
whatsapp so the nature of conflict

1267
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:55,880
around us is changing we used to be

1268
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:59,539
fighting traditional Wars for thousands

1269
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:04,369
of years wars were we were fighting each

1270
00:54:59,539 --> 00:55:06,680
other with bow and arrows and swords but

1271
00:55:04,369 --> 00:55:09,650
technology has always been shaping the

1272
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:11,359
face of conflict and the face of war as

1273
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:14,539
we got good enough technology to take

1274
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:18,650
the war to seas with it by building

1275
00:55:14,539 --> 00:55:23,740
warships creating air sea war and then

1276
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:28,099
air war technology shapes how we fight

1277
00:55:23,740 --> 00:55:31,930
but the innovation of C war and air war

1278
00:55:28,099 --> 00:55:36,049
did not take land war away conflict just

1279
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:37,460
expands into new domains then we got

1280
00:55:36,049 --> 00:55:40,640
satellites and

1281
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:44,059
which means space war and now we got

1282
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:45,890
cyber space war and if you look at a

1283
00:55:44,059 --> 00:55:48,349
modern conflict like let's say Russia

1284
00:55:45,890 --> 00:55:51,920
Ukraine they are fighting that war in

1285
00:55:48,349 --> 00:55:56,480
every single domain land air sea space

1286
00:55:51,920 --> 00:56:01,220
and cyberspace and this will not be the

1287
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:04,269
end of domains where we can fight there

1288
00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:07,189
will be new domains like I don't know

1289
00:56:04,269 --> 00:56:10,640
one day robots will be doing the

1290
00:56:07,190 --> 00:56:14,720
fighting or we will be fighting DNA

1291
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:16,970
warfare or I don't know nano for warfare

1292
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:19,879
which sounds like science fiction today

1293
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:21,439
but then again so did cyber war sound

1294
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:24,319
like science fiction just a couple of

1295
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:28,670
decades ago and then I suppose

1296
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:30,710
eventually we will end up with machine

1297
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:33,400
learning and AI based conflict and you

1298
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:37,450
don't have to believe me on that

1299
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:42,410
you can take that from President Putin

1300
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:44,899
to Moodle currency the Buddhists even

1301
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:49,279
challenged this colossal and there was

1302
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:59,810
much less teen pregnancy she would no

1303
00:56:49,280 --> 00:57:02,030
grossen don't need regional leader

1304
00:56:59,810 --> 00:57:05,990
inverter is fairly standard leader

1305
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:11,780
emiram who is the leader in AI will lead

1306
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:15,589
the world the good news is that right

1307
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:20,080
now today machine learning is basically

1308
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:23,240
only used by the good guys it's not yet

1309
00:57:20,080 --> 00:57:25,490
being used by bad guys security

1310
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:27,500
companies including everyone every

1311
00:57:25,490 --> 00:57:28,759
single security company here will tell

1312
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:31,730
you about how they use machine learning

1313
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:35,090
to build defenses and we aren't really

1314
00:57:31,730 --> 00:57:38,170
yet seeing attackers doing that but

1315
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:40,280
that's gonna change as well eventually

1316
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:42,560
deployment of machine learning and AI

1317
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:45,560
systems will become so easy to use that

1318
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:48,440
any idiot will be able to use them and

1319
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:50,630
then we will start seeing self morphing

1320
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:53,930
malware which learns or phishing attacks

1321
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:56,440
using machine learning tactics all of

1322
00:57:53,930 --> 00:58:04,430
these will happen hasn't happened yet

1323
00:57:56,440 --> 00:58:07,220
but it will so criminals are different

1324
00:58:04,430 --> 00:58:11,029
from governments criminals go after the

1325
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:12,649
low-hanging fruit when criminals tried

1326
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:15,190
to gain access to your network they're

1327
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:18,590
not really after you they're after money

1328
00:58:15,190 --> 00:58:20,630
if it's too hard too slow too expensive

1329
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:23,240
to gain access to your network they will

1330
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:25,850
go after an easier target and believe me

1331
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:28,459
the Internet is a garden of low-hanging

1332
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:33,470
fruits they'll easily find easier places

1333
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:35,390
to hack so to fight criminal attackers

1334
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:38,299
you don't have to have perfect security

1335
00:58:35,390 --> 00:58:43,520
just have to have a little bit better

1336
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:46,210
security than the other targets but then

1337
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:50,300
when you are facing governments

1338
00:58:46,210 --> 00:58:53,119
the rules are different governmental

1339
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:56,570
attackers don't give up if they can't

1340
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:58,910
get in they will try again if they still

1341
00:58:56,570 --> 00:59:01,910
can't get in they will try again and if

1342
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:04,220
the attacker just never gives up it's

1343
00:59:01,910 --> 00:59:06,700
likely that sooner or later they will

1344
00:59:04,220 --> 00:59:10,490
get in and that makes them such a hard

1345
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:15,700
target or such a hard enemy to fight

1346
00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:20,270
when you are the target and that means

1347
00:59:15,700 --> 00:59:22,368
my friends and colleagues that the times

1348
00:59:20,270 --> 00:59:23,740
of building walls around our networks

1349
00:59:22,369 --> 00:59:28,099
are over

1350
00:59:23,740 --> 00:59:29,930
we can't keep all the attackers out even

1351
00:59:28,099 --> 00:59:32,270
if they're not governmental if they are

1352
00:59:29,930 --> 00:59:34,640
persistent enough they will get in if

1353
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:38,900
you have large enough Network they will

1354
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:42,020
get in so we have to stop thinking about

1355
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:43,790
how we could build stronger walls and

1356
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:47,750
start focusing on what's happening

1357
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:51,020
inside of the walls so we're able to

1358
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:58,430
detect when there's a breach so we can

1359
00:59:51,020 --> 01:00:00,349
respond when there's a bridge and if you

1360
00:59:58,430 --> 01:00:02,720
think about how much the world changed

1361
01:00:00,349 --> 01:00:06,140
during 25 short years from my trip to

1362
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:09,709
Austria and renting a boat and how it

1363
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:11,359
seems impossible to now understand how

1364
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:15,200
you could even do that without the

1365
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:17,509
internet well we are facing exactly our

1366
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:19,520
large change in the future as well

1367
01:00:17,510 --> 01:00:22,160
the things we now take for granted will

1368
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:27,880
seem like ancient history in very short

1369
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:32,509
time and that means that your job my job

1370
01:00:27,880 --> 01:00:38,119
our job is not to check your computers

1371
01:00:32,510 --> 01:00:42,069
our job is to secure the society thank

1372
01:00:38,119 --> 01:00:42,069
you for your work thank you very much

1373
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:50,980
that was wonderful Mako that's one of

1374
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:52,890
the best opening tennis we've had it

1375
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:55,570
also can I ask you a quick question

1376
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:57,940
thank you in the in the same way as you

1377
01:00:55,570 --> 01:01:00,130
had that moment with your younger

1378
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:02,170
colleague I won with my daughter I was

1379
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:04,510
explaining to her I was saying probably

1380
01:01:02,170 --> 01:01:07,240
the single thing that makes her life

1381
01:01:04,510 --> 01:01:09,490
most different to mine and I picked this

1382
01:01:07,240 --> 01:01:10,810
up and said that these things are now

1383
01:01:09,490 --> 01:01:14,140
mobile I said in my day

1384
01:01:10,810 --> 01:01:16,960
phones were connected and before I had a

1385
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:19,390
chance to say to the wall or to a desk

1386
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:23,890
or whatever she hopped in and said you

1387
01:01:19,390 --> 01:01:25,480
mean like to your pants and I did just

1388
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:26,589
think for that how cool would have been

1389
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:28,750
that you're out one day that's what I'll

1390
01:01:26,589 --> 01:01:32,710
call them I'm not wearing my phone pants

1391
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:34,119
damn but what I use my phone a lot of

1392
01:01:32,710 --> 01:01:35,829
like my kids it's like they're

1393
01:01:34,119 --> 01:01:39,099
surgically attached in the space of

1394
01:01:35,829 --> 01:01:41,829
mobile where are we at on security

1395
01:01:39,099 --> 01:01:44,170
versus lack of security mm-hmm many

1396
01:01:41,829 --> 01:01:47,560
people especially Outsiders of our field

1397
01:01:44,170 --> 01:01:49,240
somehow believe that mobile devices like

1398
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:50,589
phones and tablets would be less secure

1399
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:52,779
than computers because you know they're

1400
01:01:50,589 --> 01:01:54,640
smaller and I don't know easier to lose

1401
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:56,470
things like that but of course these are

1402
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:58,270
more secure than real computers because

1403
01:01:56,470 --> 01:02:00,549
they are much more restricted the main

1404
01:01:58,270 --> 01:02:02,800
restriction is the app store or play

1405
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:04,599
model the idea that you can't just

1406
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:06,369
randomly write software and deploy and

1407
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:08,230
run it on every device it has to go

1408
01:02:06,369 --> 01:02:10,930
through checks before it's downloaded

1409
01:02:08,230 --> 01:02:12,790
from an app store and that really is the

1410
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:14,799
reason why we don't see malware on

1411
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:16,900
mobile devices and that's why I am a bit

1412
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:19,569
worried about what's happening right now

1413
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:21,970
especially about the fact that Apple is

1414
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:23,829
being taken into Supreme Court in United

1415
01:02:21,970 --> 01:02:26,339
States as they are being accused of

1416
01:02:23,829 --> 01:02:27,760
monopoly model with the App Store and

1417
01:02:26,339 --> 01:02:29,980
they're right

1418
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,300
it is a monopoly but it's a secure

1419
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:33,760
monopoly and if the end result of that

1420
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:35,319
is that app store is killed and iPhone

1421
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:37,540
users will start downloading their

1422
01:02:35,319 --> 01:02:38,920
applications from random websites we

1423
01:02:37,540 --> 01:02:40,000
will end up with exactly the same

1424
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:43,030
problems we used to have on our

1425
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:44,800
computers when most people in this room

1426
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:47,530
obviously get it and I presume they're

1427
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:49,869
personal and work security is pretty

1428
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:52,060
high when you're talking to that average

1429
01:02:49,869 --> 01:02:54,040
person who just needs to be a little bit

1430
01:02:52,060 --> 01:02:55,630
better what's what's the single thing if

1431
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,790
you could do one thing with just your

1432
01:02:55,630 --> 01:02:59,010
random person

1433
01:02:56,790 --> 01:03:01,320
in their home devices will work what's

1434
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:03,800
the one thing someone can do to

1435
01:03:01,320 --> 01:03:07,250
massively decrease their risk profile

1436
01:03:03,800 --> 01:03:10,790
it's quite depressing that we are in

1437
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:12,960
2019 and we are still using passwords

1438
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:14,670
passwords which were invented pretty

1439
01:03:12,960 --> 01:03:17,220
much when in internet for invented like

1440
01:03:14,670 --> 01:03:19,170
no 70s or something like that it's way

1441
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:21,120
way overdue to get rid of that so my

1442
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:23,070
advice to the average person on the

1443
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:25,529
street is always password managers I

1444
01:03:23,070 --> 01:03:27,600
don't even try to manage your passwords

1445
01:03:25,530 --> 01:03:29,970
because every single guidance and rule

1446
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:31,380
and helpful article in newspapers

1447
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:33,870
telling you how to take a good password

1448
01:03:31,380 --> 01:03:35,820
is always wrong because it's always the

1449
01:03:33,870 --> 01:03:38,670
same goddamn advice about digging a

1450
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:39,960
really long and complex password make

1451
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:41,820
sure it has lots of uppercase lowercase

1452
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:43,110
numbers and punctuation and make sure

1453
01:03:41,820 --> 01:03:45,150
it's completely different on every

1454
01:03:43,110 --> 01:03:46,500
website and don't write it down which is

1455
01:03:45,150 --> 01:03:47,850
basically saying that you know come up

1456
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:49,910
with something that you absolutely can't

1457
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:52,380
remember but don't write it down

1458
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:54,029
obviously you can't do that the only way

1459
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:55,950
they can do is possible managers and

1460
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:57,030
that's my tip number one great I'm gonna

1461
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:58,379
get you to sign Oh

1462
01:03:57,030 --> 01:03:59,310
punch card on there give him another

1463
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:04,290
round of applause that was just

1464
01:03:59,310 --> 01:04:05,820
wonderful you'll be hearing from me a

1465
01:04:04,290 --> 01:04:08,400
little bit over the next couple of days

1466
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:10,440
our next speaker as I think I'm Mike

1467
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:12,150
from also made clear it's just not

1468
01:04:10,440 --> 01:04:13,980
possible to put on a conference this big

1469
01:04:12,150 --> 01:04:16,110

you good morning so I need your help

1476
01:04:36,620 --> 01:04:44,160
chief information security officer it's

1477
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:46,350
it's a very lengthy title and it has

1478
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:48,690
this amazing acronym and I work with a

1479
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:50,400
lot of sizes or CISOs depending on how

1480
01:04:48,690 --> 01:04:53,220
we pronounce it through the work we do

1481
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:55,080
at pure hacking haklar secures global

1482
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:58,980
and certitude which are our major brands

1483
01:04:55,080 --> 01:05:01,049
and I have this quandary how do we

1484
01:04:58,980 --> 01:05:03,000
pronounce it is it C so or is it sighs

1485
01:05:01,050 --> 01:05:04,980
oh and I thought what better opportunity

1486
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:07,380
than to get your help and let's do a

1487
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:09,900
quick vote if you think it should be

1488
01:05:07,380 --> 01:05:10,770
pronounced C so can I see a show of

1489
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:14,160
hands

1490
01:05:10,770 --> 01:05:16,770
oh okay okay and if you believe it

1491
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:19,609
should be pronounced sigh so can you

1492
01:05:16,770 --> 01:05:22,470
give me a shot a sigh so wins excellent

1493
01:05:19,609 --> 01:05:24,270
okay so I think I've mostly been been

1494
01:05:22,470 --> 01:05:26,848
saying so so although I think I have

1495
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:29,880
been kind of alternating now and then

1496
01:05:26,849 --> 01:05:33,810
anyway so sigh so it is C so sorry

1497
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:35,369
sigh so it is alright so I was browsing

1498
01:05:33,810 --> 01:05:36,930
my LinkedIn feed which has kind of

1499
01:05:35,369 --> 01:05:40,079
become like I don't know the Facebook of

1500
01:05:36,930 --> 01:05:42,390
our industry in some ways and there was

1501
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:43,800
a really amusing clip and some of you

1502
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:44,879
may have already seen this but I want to

1503
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:48,349
apply it and then let's have a

1504
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,349
discussion about what we see

1505
01:06:40,369 --> 01:06:45,780
so so my reaction was very much the same

1506
01:06:43,859 --> 01:06:47,549
when I first saw this video and I kind

1507
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:49,440
of couldn't stop watching it I had to

1508
01:06:47,550 --> 01:06:51,420
keep replaying it and replaying it and

1509
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:53,280
and the and then all of these other

1510
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:54,960
things started to occur to me about this

1511
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:56,760
video and like first of all why am i

1512
01:06:54,960 --> 01:06:59,940
laughing like why am i laughing it at

1513
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:01,050
this misfortune this incident and so

1514
01:06:59,940 --> 01:07:02,520
what I thought is we have a bit of fun

1515
01:07:01,050 --> 01:07:04,380
and actually kind of go through this and

1516
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:06,150
see if we can can have a discussion

1517
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:07,890
about some of the points here because I

1518
01:07:06,150 --> 01:07:09,450
think there's a lot of relevance about

1519
01:07:07,890 --> 01:07:13,109
our industry that is contained in this

1520
01:07:09,450 --> 01:07:17,700
simple video so let's talk about the

1521
01:07:13,109 --> 01:07:19,319
Desai so clearly first of all the first

1522
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:22,169
observation is we see this guy has a

1523
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:24,300
target painted on his chest and that's

1524
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:26,730
not unlike a real sigh so is it in some

1525
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:29,550
regards right and I want to clarify too

1526
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:31,349
that when we talk about this role of the

1527
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:33,270
chief information security officer in

1528
01:07:31,349 --> 01:07:36,180
some organizations they haven't formally

1529
01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:38,339
recognized that role there's no sighs so

1530
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:40,799
as such but what I would suggest to you

1531
01:07:38,339 --> 01:07:42,779
is that the target is on someone in

1532
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:45,359
every organization whether they know it

1533
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:47,760
or not the default size so if you like

1534
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:49,740
so as I'm talking about this role and

1535
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:50,820
the sigh so have a think about people in

1536
01:07:49,740 --> 01:07:52,618
your organization who this might

1537
01:07:50,820 --> 01:07:55,080
actually apply to even though you might

1538
01:07:52,619 --> 01:07:56,940
not formally recognize that that as a

1539
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:59,700
role and then I started to think we'll

1540
01:07:56,940 --> 01:08:02,070
hang on why did he get shot in the leg

1541
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:05,580
like what could we think about with this

1542
01:08:02,070 --> 01:08:07,530
isoh about why this this happened to to

1543
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:09,720
him and then I thought well there's a

1544
01:08:07,530 --> 01:08:12,390
few different scenarios here and so the

1545
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:14,549
first thing is if we believe kind of as

1546
01:08:12,390 --> 01:08:16,259
a metaphor that the sigh so getting shot

1547
01:08:14,550 --> 01:08:18,509
in the leg is more about the

1548
01:08:16,259 --> 01:08:21,210
organization or the enterprise suffering

1549
01:08:18,509 --> 01:08:23,339
some kind of of mishap then it's a bit

1550
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:25,020
of a bit of an unfair representation to

1551
01:08:23,339 --> 01:08:27,059
put it all on on the sigh so and

1552
01:08:25,020 --> 01:08:30,299
typically we see sighs those who have a

1553
01:08:27,060 --> 01:08:32,040
team of people working with them to help

1554
01:08:30,299 --> 01:08:35,609
protect the enterprise don't win and

1555
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:38,460
those team could consist of of permanent

1556
01:08:35,609 --> 01:08:42,150
staff who could consist of contractors

1557
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:43,920
and outsource providers could also

1558
01:08:42,149 --> 01:08:46,950
consist of vendors they know that AHA

1559
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:50,190
the vendor maybe the vendor who provided

1560
01:08:46,950 --> 01:08:51,839
the bulletproof vest kind of failed to

1561
01:08:50,189 --> 01:08:56,068
disclose the fact that the protection

1562
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:57,988
stops about here or here or here or here

1563
01:08:56,069 --> 01:08:59,339
right they haven't kind of fully

1564
01:08:57,988 --> 01:09:01,738
disguised so maybe that's one scenario

1565
01:08:59,339 --> 01:09:04,170
the other the other scenario that's

1566
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:07,889
interesting is what I refer to as the

1567
01:09:04,170 --> 01:09:11,180
size o of overwhelm you know the job ads

1568
01:09:07,890 --> 01:09:15,450
right wanted chief information security

1569
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:18,049
officer must have 80 years of strategic

1570
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:20,399
security management experience and

1571
01:09:18,049 --> 01:09:23,850
managed networks and firewalls

1572
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:27,049
and have certifications in penetration

1573
01:09:23,850 --> 01:09:30,000
testing so these pore sizes are

1574
01:09:27,049 --> 01:09:32,028
overwhelmed and under-resourced and

1575
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,370
they're going to get shot in the leg

1576
01:09:32,029 --> 01:09:39,960
often this is a problem for them then

1577
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:42,660
we've got another type of size so that I

1578
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:45,719
like to call the deputized Sai so and we

1579
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:47,250
work with some organizations that really

1580
01:09:45,719 --> 01:09:49,200
are sort of getting to a point in their

1581
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:51,120
security journey where they've realized

1582
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:52,858
that they need a size oh but they don't

1583
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:54,870
go out and hire one they just sort of

1584
01:09:52,859 --> 01:09:56,760
deputize the you know well Bob's been

1585
01:09:54,870 --> 01:10:00,390
here a long time let's make him Masai so

1586
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:02,160
and so poor Bob he's just coming in has

1587
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:04,980
no background perhaps in IT it's very

1588
01:10:02,160 --> 01:10:06,360
business focused very good at governance

1589
01:10:04,980 --> 01:10:09,150
and compliance but doesn't really

1590
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:11,730
appreciate the technical aspects and the

1591
01:10:09,150 --> 01:10:13,349
metaphor for this situation is that

1592
01:10:11,730 --> 01:10:16,230
Bob's getting shot in a league he

1593
01:10:13,350 --> 01:10:19,640
doesn't even know he has because he has

1594
01:10:16,230 --> 01:10:22,290
no visibility over over the situation

1595
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:23,639
let's turn our focus now then to the

1596
01:10:22,290 --> 01:10:26,040
penetration

1597
01:10:23,639 --> 01:10:28,949
the technical wizard who's going to

1598
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:30,989
discover the the exposure here of the of

1599
01:10:28,949 --> 01:10:33,570
the of the leg that the sizer is not

1600
01:10:30,989 --> 01:10:36,900
aware of and my first question here is

1601
01:10:33,570 --> 01:10:39,960
well this guy look like a penetration

1602
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:41,969
tester to you we have a bit of a

1603
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:45,239
stereotype of penetration testers don't

1604
01:10:41,969 --> 01:10:48,840
we the hood each type the the teenager

1605
01:10:45,239 --> 01:10:50,369
in the basement if you will so you know

1606
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:52,889
there's some interesting dynamics around

1607
01:10:50,369 --> 01:10:54,059
what that stereotype can potentially do

1608
01:10:52,889 --> 01:10:55,230
and if we're going back and we talk

1609
01:10:54,060 --> 01:10:57,900
about those sites those who may have

1610
01:10:55,230 --> 01:11:00,598
missed the information whether it be

1611
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:03,509
technical guidance have they listened to

1612
01:11:00,599 --> 01:11:06,420
the technical guidance provided by these

1613
01:11:03,510 --> 01:11:09,389
experts and is that stereotype holding

1614
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:13,079
us back the other interesting thing

1615
01:11:09,389 --> 01:11:15,449
about this is when the penetration

1616
01:11:13,079 --> 01:11:18,389
tester or this guy in the video pulls

1617
01:11:15,449 --> 01:11:20,309
the trigger now I showed this video to a

1618
01:11:18,389 --> 01:11:22,560
whole bunch of people without the

1619
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:24,960
context of scishow and penetration

1620
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:27,030
tester so they just saw the sketch it's

1621
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:30,659
on YouTube it obviously doesn't have

1622
01:11:27,030 --> 01:11:32,369
those labels on it that context and the

1623
01:11:30,659 --> 01:11:33,750
people who saw the video that way said

1624
01:11:32,369 --> 01:11:36,630
to me oh this is an accident

1625
01:11:33,750 --> 01:11:38,849
this guy has pulled the trigger but he's

1626
01:11:36,630 --> 01:11:42,239
not looking right he doesn't know what

1627
01:11:38,849 --> 01:11:44,010
he's actually doing then I then when I

1628
01:11:42,239 --> 01:11:47,428
show people the video with the context

1629
01:11:44,010 --> 01:11:49,260
of size o and penetration tester they

1630
01:11:47,429 --> 01:11:52,829
all say hi and no no he knew what he was

1631
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:55,079
doing is this deliberate so this is an

1632
01:11:52,829 --> 01:11:56,519
interesting point about how we think

1633
01:11:55,079 --> 01:11:59,070
about penetration testers that

1634
01:11:56,520 --> 01:12:01,920
everything they do is deliberate but the

1635
01:11:59,070 --> 01:12:04,170
fascinating thing about pen testing is

1636
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:05,940
and yes there's methodologies that are

1637
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:07,829
followed and earnest and this is all

1638
01:12:05,940 --> 01:12:09,750
this nice stuff the way it works but

1639
01:12:07,829 --> 01:12:11,099
there are absolutely vulnerabilities

1640
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:13,290
that are discovered completely

1641
01:12:11,099 --> 01:12:14,969
accidentally sometimes and so it's just

1642
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:17,099
the the the art of getting the

1643
01:12:14,969 --> 01:12:18,989
penetration tester in to do the testing

1644
01:12:17,099 --> 01:12:19,920
that is that may result in this even

1645
01:12:18,989 --> 01:12:23,790
though it's accidental

1646
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:28,110
so accidental or not you still learn

1647
01:12:23,790 --> 01:12:30,150
some lessons along the way and then it

1648
01:12:28,110 --> 01:12:32,880
brings me to what I think is the most

1649
01:12:30,150 --> 01:12:35,950
provocative part of what's going on here

1650
01:12:32,880 --> 01:12:40,060
and this is the fact that the sizer is

1651
01:12:35,950 --> 01:12:42,490
they're saying come on shoot me I'm

1652
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:45,310
secure it's this it's this false sense

1653
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:47,860
of security that the cypher has that

1654
01:12:45,310 --> 01:12:51,070
he's nothing bad is going to happen and

1655
01:12:47,860 --> 01:12:52,990
we see this all the time we see vendors

1656
01:12:51,070 --> 01:12:55,299
we see organizations sometimes make

1657
01:12:52,990 --> 01:12:57,519
claims like we have invented an

1658
01:12:55,300 --> 01:12:59,230
unhackable product we've got an

1659
01:12:57,520 --> 01:13:02,260
unhackable network it's this

1660
01:12:59,230 --> 01:13:05,169
overconfidence that that plays out but

1661
01:13:02,260 --> 01:13:08,290
it's playing out also in much more

1662
01:13:05,170 --> 01:13:10,060
subtle ways where some people have this

1663
01:13:08,290 --> 01:13:12,160
notion and this this sort of I guess

1664
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:13,570
this beginners kind of notion when you

1665
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:15,940
when you start to look at security that

1666
01:13:13,570 --> 01:13:17,950
somehow security should be absolute and

1667
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:19,900
so there's this subtle problem that

1668
01:13:17,950 --> 01:13:22,809
happens across boardrooms all over this

1669
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:24,610
country where the size of the story the

1670
01:13:22,810 --> 01:13:27,490
sea so sorry at this I said it right the

1671
01:13:24,610 --> 01:13:30,009
first time this the size Oh will be

1672
01:13:27,490 --> 01:13:33,070
presenting to the board and the director

1673
01:13:30,010 --> 01:13:38,590
leans over the table and asks this

1674
01:13:33,070 --> 01:13:40,080
question are we secure are we secure now

1675
01:13:38,590 --> 01:13:42,820
if you're a parent and you've got

1676
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:44,980
particularly teenagers you'll know that

1677
01:13:42,820 --> 01:13:47,889
asking a question that's only going to

1678
01:13:44,980 --> 01:13:51,429
warrant a yes or no answer is a very bad

1679
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:53,650
idea so we need to stop asking the

1680
01:13:51,430 --> 01:13:56,230
question are we secure because it has

1681
01:13:53,650 --> 01:13:57,790
this inbuilt notion that security is an

1682
01:13:56,230 --> 01:14:00,429
absolute and we know that security is

1683
01:13:57,790 --> 01:14:03,040
not an absolute so the questions need to

1684
01:14:00,430 --> 01:14:05,350
get better from the highest levels and

1685
01:14:03,040 --> 01:14:07,750
if you can start asking questions like

1686
01:14:05,350 --> 01:14:09,700
how secure are we and recognize that

1687
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:11,410
your security posture falls onto a

1688
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:13,300
spectrum which a lot of us know is as

1689
01:14:11,410 --> 01:14:17,139
industry professionals but some people

1690
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:22,240
are still getting used to then you know

1691
01:14:17,140 --> 01:14:23,650
that's that's a real issue there's a

1692
01:14:22,240 --> 01:14:26,219
mobile phone or something going on there

1693
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:26,219
in the background

1694
01:14:31,770 --> 01:14:35,619
so if we ask these better questions one

1695
01:14:34,420 --> 01:14:41,260
of the fascinating things that can

1696
01:14:35,619 --> 01:14:42,549
happen is this communication ripple that

1697
01:14:41,260 --> 01:14:44,199
can happen a sort of a communication

1698
01:14:42,550 --> 01:14:46,300
ripple of inquiry that can happen from

1699
01:14:44,199 --> 01:14:48,638
the boardroom all the way down through

1700
01:14:46,300 --> 01:14:52,170
to the basement so it can really change

1701
01:14:48,639 --> 01:14:55,659
the dynamic of of how we do security and

1702
01:14:52,170 --> 01:14:59,170
then as we get near the end here I want

1703
01:14:55,659 --> 01:15:01,179
to talk about this main point here which

1704
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:02,980
i think is really sorely missed and the

1705
01:15:01,179 --> 01:15:04,809
fact we laugh at this guy's misfortune

1706
01:15:02,980 --> 01:15:06,730
we laugh at this ISOs misfortunate had

1707
01:15:04,809 --> 01:15:08,739
been shot in the leg but he's the one

1708
01:15:06,730 --> 01:15:10,989
who actually handed the weapon to the

1709
01:15:08,739 --> 01:15:13,119
penetration tester and so in our

1710
01:15:10,989 --> 01:15:16,718
industry and particularly in the theme

1711
01:15:13,119 --> 01:15:19,480
of of don't go it alone there is this

1712
01:15:16,719 --> 01:15:22,599
partnership that happens and thus ISO is

1713
01:15:19,480 --> 01:15:25,209
giving permission to the penetration

1714
01:15:22,599 --> 01:15:28,119
tester to be shot in the leg effectively

1715
01:15:25,210 --> 01:15:29,920
right so so and this is a wonderful

1716
01:15:28,119 --> 01:15:33,098
partnership it's a wonderful type of

1717
01:15:29,920 --> 01:15:34,829
engagement even though the sigh so in

1718
01:15:33,099 --> 01:15:38,469
this example is a little bit

1719
01:15:34,829 --> 01:15:44,909
overconfident about his security he

1720
01:15:38,469 --> 01:15:44,909
still ends up being shot in the leg so

1721
01:15:46,199 --> 01:15:51,070
there's really a couple of points I want

1722
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:52,570
to leave in summary around here that

1723
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:55,000
that I hope you've got from this video

1724
01:15:52,570 --> 01:15:57,429
and that's it that there is a target on

1725
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,139
someone in your organization whether you

1726
01:15:57,429 --> 01:16:01,090
whether you know it or not make sure you

1727
01:15:59,139 --> 01:16:03,130
find who that person is and give them

1728
01:16:01,090 --> 01:16:05,500
all the resources and encourage that

1729
01:16:03,130 --> 01:16:07,090
encouragement they need to succeed and

1730
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:11,230
the other one the other point too is

1731
01:16:07,090 --> 01:16:14,590
that if you're that person then make

1732
01:16:11,230 --> 01:16:16,718
sure you act on technical advice it's

1733
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:18,099
always better even if you're you've come

1734
01:16:16,719 --> 01:16:19,449
from a background where you don't kind

1735
01:16:18,099 --> 01:16:21,429
of acknowledge and you're not interested

1736
01:16:19,449 --> 01:16:24,730
in technical opinion make sure you

1737
01:16:21,429 --> 01:16:27,429
really do you know have a spirit of

1738
01:16:24,730 --> 01:16:30,098
accepting it and working with it and

1739
01:16:27,429 --> 01:16:32,469
remember that security is never absolute

1740
01:16:30,099 --> 01:16:33,790
there's always this gradient and this

1741
01:16:32,469 --> 01:16:36,250
measure and we always want to work

1742
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:38,889
towards improving it and remember one

1743
01:16:36,250 --> 01:16:40,570
thing that it's much better to get shot

1744
01:16:38,889 --> 01:16:42,969
in the leg than it is to get shot in the

1745
01:16:40,570 --> 01:16:46,929
head at the end of the day

1746
01:16:42,969 --> 01:16:49,930
if as a sigh so you have got all of your

1747
01:16:46,930 --> 01:16:52,900
ducks in alignment and you've working

1748
01:16:49,930 --> 01:16:55,360
towards working with these partnerships

1749
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:59,019
and you're not going it alone then

1750
01:16:55,360 --> 01:17:01,150
hopefully hopefully over time you'll end

1751
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:05,290
up looking and your organization will

1752
01:17:01,150 --> 01:17:12,790
end up looking something like this thank

1753
01:17:05,290 --> 01:17:14,320
you very much yeah very much Mike

1754
01:17:12,790 --> 01:17:15,790
wonderful wonderful stop we're gonna

1755
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:17,019
give you a little gift mokou if you'd

1756
01:17:15,790 --> 01:17:18,550
like to come to stage as well we've got

1757
01:17:17,020 --> 01:17:20,050
a gift for your presentation may go back

1758
01:17:18,550 --> 01:17:21,460
on stage for a second just quickly we're

1759
01:17:20,050 --> 01:17:21,969
gonna give you a little gift as a thank

those have been to assert before know

1762
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,739
that we've done the gift thing before

1763
01:17:25,239 --> 01:17:29,320
we've often gave away our commemorative

1764
01:17:26,739 --> 01:17:31,089
coffee cup one year sample of Australian

1765
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:32,679
wine one year did a cheese board one

1766
01:17:31,090 --> 01:17:34,630
year this year we've gone a little bit

1767
01:17:32,680 --> 01:17:36,690
nerdy quick sharp hands if you've done a

1768
01:17:34,630 --> 01:17:37,810
bit of The Legend of Zelda in your time

1769
01:17:36,690 --> 01:17:39,009
fantastic

1770
01:17:37,810 --> 01:17:41,020
quick show of hands if you think your

1771
01:17:39,010 --> 01:17:42,940
reasonable player of chess but if you

1772
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:50,410
chess place yeah great okay we'll look

1773
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:52,299
at this The Legend of Zelda chess set it

1774
01:17:50,410 --> 01:17:54,989
doesn't get much bigger than that

1775
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:54,989
Mikko

1776
01:17:58,220 --> 01:18:01,880
give them both the big round of applause

1777
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:04,190
for getting us off and running in 2019

1778
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:05,480
The Legend of Zelda chess said thank you

1779
01:18:04,190 --> 01:18:07,940
very much gentlemen

1780
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:08,959
want to thank our sponsors Pearson C on

1781
01:18:07,940 --> 01:18:10,969
that occasion all the other sponsors

1782
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:12,380
simply not possible without your support

1783
01:18:10,970 --> 01:18:13,730
we're about to break from morning to

1784
01:18:12,380 --> 01:18:15,830
morning and afternoon tea will be served

1785
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:18,139

morning to be broken about concurrent

1789
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:27,650
