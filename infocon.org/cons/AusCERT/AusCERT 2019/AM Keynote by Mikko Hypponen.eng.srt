applause for Miko hipa turn thank you

22
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:54,690
and I'm good morning my name is Mickel

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:59,579
and yes I am a geek and a nerd and yes I

24
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:06,080
do live in Helsinki which is in Finland

25
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:11,189
which is in Europe and I have been doing

26
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:12,330
InfoSec all my life I'll be 50 years old

27
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:14,759
this year

28
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:20,009
so that's a pretty long time to be

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:22,409
working with computers securing but it's

30
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:23,280
not just me which is turning 50 this

31
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,270
year

32
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,030
if you've read about the history of

33
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:35,189
ARPANET you do recall that the historic

34
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:37,740
first packets ever sent over ARPANET

35
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:41,579
which then became the Internet were

36
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:44,089
locked by hand into this imb log book

37
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:47,460
which had an entry on the 29th of

38
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:49,860
October 1969 saying that the first

39
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:52,679
message was successfully sent from one

40
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:55,710
machine to another on a network which

41
00:01:52,680 --> 00:02:00,500
then became what we today know as the

42
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:03,119
Internet that's a pretty big deal now

43
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:04,350
internet obviously didn't become an

44
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,020
overnight success

45
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:10,500
it became the thing that we know today

46
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:13,090
with utilities and applications that we

47
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:15,790
could all use I guess most important but

48
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:17,260
when and the web isn't 50 years old the

49
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:19,929
web is 30 years old

50
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:21,849
although for most of us it's 25 years

51
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:26,590
old because the web really became

52
00:02:21,849 --> 00:02:29,379
mainstream in 1994 1994 1995 I set up

53
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:33,129
the first web site for our company in

54
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:35,890
April 1994 and I remember that there

55
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:38,018
were 16 web sites in our country we were

56
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:41,738
website number 17 that's that's how

57
00:02:38,019 --> 00:02:44,890
early days it was but the change from

58
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:49,690
the web then was very very fast the

59
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:50,880
world changed the world changed during

60
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:54,480
our lifetime

61
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:59,310
what Internet did was it took away

62
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:04,690
borders borders distance and geography

63
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:08,079
disappeared disappeared in a good way

64
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:11,980
and well the reason why we're here in a

65
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:14,680
bad way now obviously we had computer

66
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:17,649
security problems before the internet

67
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,500
you know things spreading on floppy

68
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,720
disks you might remember these what

69
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:24,730
viruses which would infect boot sectors

70
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,440
of five 1/4 inch floppy disks for

71
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,328
three-and-a-half inch floppy disks and

72
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,519
would go around the world as people

73
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:33,010
would travel and physically carry these

74
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:35,049
on themselves those were a real problem

75
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:37,090
but obviously when you look at this

76
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:39,400
speed of spreading in the hind side from

77
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:40,930
those it's nothing to compare what

78
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,700
happened then when email became

79
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,680
commonplace and then eventually web

80
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:47,048
became such a big deal that we could

81
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,829
have things like you know exploit kids

82
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:54,010
and phishing sites and things like that

83
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:56,590
and now the web and the Internet and

84
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,388
applications and mobile phones are such

85
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:02,430
an integrated part of our everyday lives

86
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:06,750
it's hard to remember how it was so

87
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:06,750
let's talk about Austria

88
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:13,910
couple of months ago I had a chat with a

89
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:16,910
colleague at the office a young guy

90
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:19,089
maybe 25 years old one of the young

91
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:21,650
coders we've recruited from University

92
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:24,440
who had just come back from a business

93
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:26,030
trip in Vienna Austria and we chatted

94
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,730
about Austria and I mentioned to him

95
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:31,880
about this holiday that I took to

96
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:36,410
Austria when I was his age like around

97
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:39,409
1992 1993 me a couple of friends went to

98
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:42,500
Austria we rented a car we drove to the

99
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:44,750
Alps where we had pre booked a boat

100
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,410
which we rented that we went sailing on

101
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:53,330
a on a lake in the middle of the Alps

102
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:55,760
and then this young coder asked me how

103
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:58,700
did you actually do that like how did

104
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,700
you how did you plan all that how did

105
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:03,680
you find where you want to go how did

106
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,210
you rent the power to rent the car where

107
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,180
did you find boat rental places before

108
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:12,049
the internet because this was before the

109
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:15,140
internet web wasn't there and I was

110
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:18,590
baffled I had no idea I absolutely

111
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:23,390
couldn't recall how how we did this

112
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:25,099
before the Internet but we did I really

113
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:27,770
had to like think back and try to

114
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:31,330
remember like how did things work before

115
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:34,340
the internet hug and III guess I called

116
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:35,810
international dialer systems which is a

117
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,760
number that you used to call where there

118
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:39,830
was a lady with phone books for

119
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,599
different countries and you would ask

120
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,950
her that hey I'm looking for boat rental

121
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,950
places in Austria and she would pick

122
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:47,479
Austrian yellow pages and tried to find

123
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:49,130
things and give you numbers and then you

124
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,580
would call those places with my school

125
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:54,050
German to pre book a boat and then of

126
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:56,840
course when we rented the car there is

127
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:59,090
no GPS there is no mobile phone it seems

128
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:02,830
like ancient history and this is 25

129
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:04,460
years ago world is changing fast

130
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:08,390
changing for the better

131
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:11,989
mostly but also in some ways changing

132
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:14,180
for the worst before the Internet we

133
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:18,550
only had to worry about the criminals

134
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:20,930
who were living close to us that's it

135
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,500
now we have to worry about criminals who

136
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,630
can be

137
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,030
anywhere on the planet that's the

138
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:28,790
downside now don't get me wrong there's

139
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:31,159
much more good upsides than downsides

140
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:34,010
that the Internet has brought us but it

141
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:38,240
has changed for the first time the risk

142
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:39,980
ratio of an average person that he's now

143
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,880
more likely to become a victim of a

144
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:46,730
crime in the online world than the real

145
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:49,690
world and that's a pretty big shift and

146
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:54,860
it's happening right now

147
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:58,550
so one thing that I keep wondering about

148
00:06:54,860 --> 00:07:01,040
myself is that after all the lessons

149
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:04,310
that we've learned in computer security

150
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,680
about about how to make better and more

151
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:09,740
secure systems how to build security at

152
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:14,419
every layer of new developments how come

153
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:18,260
we keep repeating the same mistakes over

154
00:07:14,419 --> 00:07:19,640
and over again in many ways when you

155
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,530
look at some computer security

156
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:24,440
everything old is new again we keep

157
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:26,809
running into the same problems let me

158
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:32,180
give you an example this is the AIDS

159
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:36,320
information Trojan from 1989 1980s I ran

160
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:37,580
some Trojan from 1980s for real yes this

161
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,440
was around some Trojan it was

162
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:41,840
distributed on a floppy because internet

163
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,250
didn't exist people were mailed this

164
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,010
floppy which claimed to be a useful

165
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:48,110
application when you installed it after

166
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:50,110
a couple of days it would encrypt the

167
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:56,270
hard drive and show you a ransom note

168
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:58,450
like this in 1989 compare that to petia

169
00:07:56,270 --> 00:08:00,740
which is one of the most well known

170
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:03,409
current ransom Trojan it's almost

171
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:06,740
exactly the same thing except of course

172
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:09,050
in 1989 it wasn't asking for Bitcoin was

173
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:12,520
asking you to do a wire transfer to a

174
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:14,780
Pio books in Panama nevertheless

175
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:18,109
everything old is new again another

176
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:22,630
example many of you remember macro

177
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:26,630
viruses 1999 2000 2001 a love-letter

178
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:29,900
nuclear Leroux infecting Word Excel

179
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:33,320
PowerPoint spreading over macros we got

180
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:35,270
rid of this problem because Microsoft

181
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,900
changed the way micro

182
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:41,240
of his works they disabled macros by

183
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:43,549
default to get rid of the macro virus

184
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:47,620
problem they did this in Microsoft

185
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:50,120
Office 2003 long time ago 16 years ago

186
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:52,640
and now when we look at the problems

187
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:56,060
we're seeing today we're seeing macro

188
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,490
viruses or macro malware again and the

189
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:01,400
same default setting that was changed in

190
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:04,390
2003 is still there macros are disabled

191
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:08,150
by default which means today the attacks

192
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:10,490
try to trick you in to clicking the most

193
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:12,620
dangerous button that you have in

194
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,840
Microsoft Office the enable content

195
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:17,810
button which is the button that they

196
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:20,060
introduced in 2003 if there are macros

197
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:22,489
in the file you open they are disabled

198
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:25,099
but they will helpfully prompt you if

199
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:27,800
you might want to enable them anyway and

200
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,300
now then the attacks are trying to trick

201
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:32,959
you in to clicking that button which

202
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:37,130
sounds pretty innocent it's enabling

203
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:39,800
content so I have friends who work at

204
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:42,110
Microsoft actually I have friends who

205
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,750
work in the Microsoft of his team and

206
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:50,800
I've told them that they should rename

207
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:50,800
the button to infect my system

208
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:57,150
because then maybe then people wouldn't

209
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:59,230
be so keen on clicking on that so yes

210
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:01,060
everything old is new again we keep

211
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:06,970
repeating the same mistakes

212
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:08,619
another example telnet unencrypted

213
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:10,390
terminal connection from one machine to

214
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,920
another with me which means anybody

215
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:14,290
who's watching the traffic sees

216
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,849
everything it's unencrypted so if you're

217
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,500
doing the telnet session over Wi-Fi

218
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:19,630
anybody who's there will get your

219
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,520
passwords or whatever you type such a

220
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:26,680
horribly bad idea we got rid of telnet

221
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:28,840
in the 1990s and now when you look where

222
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:31,660
we are today with this brave new world

223
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:34,720
of Internet of Things and connected

224
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:37,630
devices for some reason that I cannot

225
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,490
explain we are reintroducing telnet as a

226
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:41,170
service on these devices most of which

227
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:43,060
are running line up so they are unique

228
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:47,829
systems same kind of systems which we

229
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:50,439
got rid of telnet Dee in 1995 or 1997

230
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:54,010
when we look at the botnets that we are

231
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:56,610
now seeing which only infect IOT devices

232
00:10:54,010 --> 00:11:00,040
which refuse to infect real computers

233
00:10:56,610 --> 00:11:02,440
many of those are using telnet as the

234
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,650
way in most famously Mirai which

235
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:08,680
actually has a built-in built-in list of

236
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:10,900
telnet usernames and passwords it tries

237
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,599
to gain access like admin admin support

238
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:18,370
support root root all my favorite mother

239
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:20,230
 I don't really know why tries

240
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:22,420
logging in as mother and password ass

241
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:23,980
but it does maybe there is a system

242
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:27,910
somewhere which this is the default

243
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:32,100
password so yes we keep repeating the

244
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:37,920
same mistakes and to make this harder

245
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:41,130
when we when we succeed in our work

246
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:45,520
nothing happens

247
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:49,030
that's a pretty pretty big downer

248
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:53,160
actually when we are successful nothing

249
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:56,350
happens like if you do your job right

250
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,000
your company and your clients will not

251
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,830
be on the cover of the newspaper

252
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,040
tomorrow because there never is a

253
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:03,820
newspaper which would have headlines and

254
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,829
you know the biggest

255
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:08,760
but in Australia was not hacked

256
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:11,080
yesterday that's not news

257
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:13,780
and I sometimes end up in these

258
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:17,680
questions over this because I I do a lot

259
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:20,020
of meetings with f-secure clients and

260
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,939
customers typically you know board

261
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:26,319
meetings or leadership team meetings and

262
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:29,920
it's typically the CFO who looks at the

263
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,320
figures and he's like we're paying you

264
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:36,939
guys it says here we're paying you guys

265
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,800
fifty thousand euros a year why are we

266
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:44,380
paying you guys fifty thousand euros a

267
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:46,359
year we have no security problems and

268
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:51,240
what I typically reply with is that well

269
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:53,830
you know what mr. CFO it's awfully clean

270
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,810
here in your boardroom why don't you

271
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:58,780
fire all your cleaners and janitors

272
00:12:55,810 --> 00:13:02,410
clearly you don't need them so when do

273
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:08,819
we do our jobs right we're invisible but

274
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:12,189
when we fail it is very visible and

275
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:14,680
today as more and more of our systems

276
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:18,130
and services are moving from traditional

277
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:19,930
on-prem systems into the cloud this is

278
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:25,270
becoming more and more important because

279
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:28,479
we are becoming service providers every

280
00:13:25,270 --> 00:13:31,660
company already became a software

281
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,820
company five years ago that's old news

282
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:36,189
every company is a software company your

283
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:39,580
company regardless of what you do is a

284
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:41,350
software company what's happening now is

285
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:43,720
that every company is becoming a

286
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:45,880
software service provider we are

287
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:50,980
becoming cloud providers for our

288
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:54,040
customers and that means that when we

289
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:56,260
fail it's not just that we have problems

290
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,349
internally it's that our clients and

291
00:13:56,260 --> 00:14:02,439
customers have problems and we have

292
00:13:59,350 --> 00:14:04,420
plenty of examples of this happening in

293
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:08,200
different countries over and over again

294
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:11,050
plenty of examples from this year where

295
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:13,480
service providers or software as a

296
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:15,189
service providers are unable to provide

297
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:18,130
the service because their cloud

298
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:22,240
instances have been wiped by a run so

299
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:24,430
we're Trojan which got in because a

300
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:28,000
clerk in the financial department

301
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:30,819
clicked on an Excel attachment they got

302
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:34,600
over email and I'll tell you what that's

303
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:36,700
no longer good enough the fact that

304
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:39,250
someone opened a bad spreadsheet should

305
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:41,380
never be the reason that your customers

306
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,830
can't work but that's exactly what has

307
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:45,870
happened

308
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:51,040
over and over again over the last months

309
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:53,410
we're becoming service providers and it

310
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,280
is a game of cat and mouse whatever new

311
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:59,290
safety precautions we are implementing

312
00:14:56,280 --> 00:15:03,430
the attackers are watching and trying to

313
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:06,520
figure out ways to get around them so

314
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:09,880
things like moving our email servers

315
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:13,810
from our own hosted servers into cloud

316
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:16,180
let's say office 365 only means that the

317
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:17,920
attackers will follow from the

318
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:23,650
on-premise systems into the cloud

319
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:25,089
systems so we introduce new safety

320
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:28,390
precautions like two-factor

321
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:30,580
authentication with SMS based off or

322
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:33,430
even better application or Authenticator

323
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:36,580
based authentication and the attackers

324
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:38,469
will follow let's have a look at a real

325
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:41,950
attack from not too long ago a couple of

326
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:43,390
weeks ago you get an email a file has

327
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:45,130
been shared with you please follow the

328
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:46,510
link you follow the link you end up in

329
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:48,430
onedrive which is where you have files

330
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:51,100
anyway because your organization is

331
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:53,380
running office 365 and it asks you to

332
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:55,060
authenticate to gain access to the file

333
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,380
and also you take a look at the URL

334
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:58,510
because that's what you've been trained

335
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:01,750
to do and there is the lock alright

336
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:04,330
great but you know that the lock itself

337
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:07,300
isn't good enough but then you look at

338
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:10,450
the URL and it is office.com which is a

339
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:16,240
microsoft domain and this is a microsoft

340
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:18,550
login it's asking for your username it's

341
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,890
asking for your password now obviously

342
00:16:18,550 --> 00:16:24,099
it's a phishing site because forms that

343
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:26,260
office.com is a forms hosting site where

344
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:30,100
anybody can create forms like a4 which

345
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:31,170
says onedrive sign-in to continue please

346
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,550
give your

347
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,410
but beyond that it's also a

348
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:38,319
man-in-the-middle attack because when

349
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:39,760
you give this form a real username and

350
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,070
real password it will take them and

351
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:45,520
immediately use them to log in through

352
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:49,170
the real office 365 which then triggers

353
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:54,189
the real office 365 server triggers a

354
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:57,640
two-factor authentication query and this

355
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:59,800
of course means that the real user gets

356
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:02,949
a real notification on the real device

357
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,960
which makes perfect sense because he or

358
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:06,700
she is really logging into a service or

359
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:10,300
so they believe so they will of course

360
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:16,240
punch in the code that they just

361
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:20,169
received an attacks like these are hard

362
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,120
to find as long as we keep using

363
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,910
authentication mechanisms which are

364
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:27,399
relying on the users being able to tell

365
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:31,440
the difference between a real URL or a

366
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:34,600
bad URL when URLs can look so confusing

367
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,750
office.com it's hard to tell your users

368
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:45,490
that don't trust content from office.com

369
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:49,750
is it and yes everything is becoming a

370
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:53,520
computer if it uses electricity it will

371
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:57,880
become a computer I'm not worried about

372
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:59,860
IOT revolution of smart devices that

373
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,890
doesn't worry me at all what I am

374
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:05,649
worried about is stupid

375
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:08,830
devices stupid devices going to the

376
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:11,860
Internet and this hasn't happened yet we

377
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:15,520
have right now a revolution where you go

378
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:20,530
and buy a smart watch a smart whore

379
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:24,460
smart TV and when you as a consumer buy

380
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:26,500
those things you know that they are on

381
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:28,930
the internet that's why you bought them

382
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:31,240
you bought the Smart TV so you could

383
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:33,760
watch Netflix on the TV it's obvious

384
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:36,490
that it's on the Internet you know that

385
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,320
it's on the internet but in the near

386
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:40,300
future

387
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:43,389
stupid devices will go on the Internet

388
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:44,530
as well and you have no idea that they

389
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:46,300
are on the Internet

390
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:49,149
because they will not be going to the

391
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:52,270
Internet to provide new features and

392
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:54,300
services to you the consumer they will

393
00:18:52,270 --> 00:19:00,010
be going to the Internet to provide

394
00:18:54,300 --> 00:19:01,960
benefits to the manufacturer so simple

395
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:03,580
simple stupid household items will be

396
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,350
going to the internet just for the

397
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:08,649
reason that the manufacturers want to

398
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:11,169
know where their clients are how often

399
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:14,860
do they use these devices how often do

400
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:18,010
they have failures which means when you

401
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:20,800
go and buy devices in the future you are

402
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:22,330
not even told that they are going to go

403
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,639
to the Internet and they will not be

404
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:26,169
going to the Internet using a Wi-Fi

405
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,790
connection that you could block they

406
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:30,490
will be going to the internet using 5g

407
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:34,300
or Zig Fox or something that you can't

408
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:36,490
block now there's nothing we can do to

409
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:40,270
prevent this this revolution is already

410
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:42,970
underway you can't stop this revolution

411
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:45,250
from refusing to play part because you

412
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:47,080
will play part because you won't even

413
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:49,330
know which of the devices you will buy

414
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:51,100
will be on the Internet this revolution

415
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:54,429
hasn't gone through yet because it's

416
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:56,679
still too expensive to add an IOT

417
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:59,050
chipset or and a cig Fox chips at anime

418
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,610
well eventually a 5g modem into every

419
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:04,360
device but as you know technology

420
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:07,209
becomes cheaper and cheaper in 10 years

421
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:09,399
it's going to be so cheap connectivity

422
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:13,450
can be put into anything and then it

423
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:15,720
will and this revolution has been a long

424
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:19,000
time coming

425
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:24,130
IOT and connected devices really started

426
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:26,050
from factories and plants factory

427
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:28,420
automation companies started building

428
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:30,760
plant automation systems computerized

429
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:37,690
plant automation systems already in the

430
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:40,270
1980s today every factory every plant

431
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:42,940
every power plant every nuclear power

432
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:47,379
plant every food processing plant runs

433
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:48,940
on computers our society runs some

434
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:54,490
computers and we got an excellent

435
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:57,160
reminder of this 7 weeks ago in this

436
00:20:54,490 --> 00:20:58,780
facility which belongs to North Kudrow

437
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,660
which is the second

438
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:03,820
largest company in Norway one of the

439
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,890
largest aluminum manufacturers in the

440
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:08,649
world with factories around the world

441
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:12,520
including aluminum factories in Qatar

442
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:14,710
and in Brazil and on the Tuesday morning

443
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:15,910
seven weeks ago when employees got to

444
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:18,940
their office there was a handwritten

445
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:22,110
note that every office door which says

446
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:25,060
do not turn on your computer

447
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:27,040
there's a note at the bottom which has

448
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:29,980
an added note an hour later that it's

449
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,750
okay to turn on your phone but don't

450
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:35,080
turn on your computer

451
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:41,520
and the if this ever happens to you this

452
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:46,030
is a bad sign this was Locker Go Go

453
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:48,430
there's two similar gangs going or going

454
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:52,240
around now we'd ran some trojans local

455
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:54,790
Goga and mega cortex these ransom

456
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,730
trojans are different from the ones we

457
00:21:54,790 --> 00:22:00,460
used to know like crypto wall and

458
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:02,520
cryptolocker or wanna cry and petia

459
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:06,930
because these things do not spread

460
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:09,879
they're not worms they're not viruses

461
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:12,550
they are targeted the attackers the

462
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:14,950
gangs will pick a company then they

463
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:17,649
start scanning the perimeter trying to

464
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:22,210
find ways in typically looking for VP

465
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:25,960
and end points or OWA sites or some way

466
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:28,300
in and once they gain access then they

467
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:32,020
use lateral movement trying to gain

468
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:34,240
access to everything going from one data

469
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:37,300
center to another and once they are

470
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:39,460
happy with the level of access they have

471
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,690
once they believe that they can destroy

472
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:44,350
everything in one go

473
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:45,760
that's what they do in this case in the

474
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:48,429
middle of the night between Monday and

475
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:50,560
Tuesday all the data centers went down

476
00:22:48,430 --> 00:22:53,380
they were wiped with a very fast

477
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:55,540
encryption algorithm which tried

478
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:57,400
deleting everything or encrypting

479
00:22:55,540 --> 00:23:03,100
everything and then when they were done

480
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:05,490
they were not asking for Bitcoin no they

481
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:10,100
simply left their contact information

482
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:15,470
here's our email please get in touch

483
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:17,540
let's negotiate that's what they do and

484
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:20,270
this is a different beast this is a

485
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:24,139
different kind of a problem than the

486
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:29,210
traditional random malware which would

487
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:31,370
then use encryption mechanisms to strike

488
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:32,690
and run some trojan attack against your

489
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:37,159
organization's because these are

490
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:40,700
targeted and their ransom Trojan problem

491
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:43,130
really plays on a very old idea that

492
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:46,550
we've seen for years and years with

493
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:49,340
cyber criminals the old idea that you

494
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:52,399
steal information and then you sell that

495
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:54,110
information to the highest bidder this

496
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,780
is what cyber criminals have been doing

497
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:59,479
for years and years well it's exactly

498
00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:02,450
the same idea in ransom Trojans it's

499
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:04,760
just that the attackers realized that in

500
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:07,280
many cases the highest bidder

501
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:09,650
is the victim themselves they are

502
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:12,680
willing to pay more for the data than

503
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:14,780
anyone else so if you can destroy the

504
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:17,690
data and make sure they can't restore it

505
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:22,100
or recover in a timely fashion they will

506
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:25,700
pay you the ransom and when this hit the

507
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:27,370
news initially it looked really really

508
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:29,270
worrying because this is aluminum

509
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:30,830
manufacturing and if you know anything

510
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:32,300
about aluminum manufacturing and I

511
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:35,810
didn't know anything about it before

512
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:38,419
this these factories are very very

513
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:40,129
fragile they run 24 hours a day

514
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:42,080
basically you build an aluminum factory

515
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:45,140
you boot it up and then it never stops

516
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:47,449
because if you have to stop it you will

517
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:49,540
lose the factory aluminum melts in and

518
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:51,620
you will never be able to recover it

519
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:53,420
sounds like theoretical this has

520
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,820
actually happened the last time this has

521
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:57,560
happened it was in February in Venezuela

522
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:59,870
as government of Venezuela has been

523
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:01,669
having extended power cuts after which

524
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:03,320
as a result of which they lost all of

525
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:05,540
their aluminum factories and they will

526
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:11,200
be without any capability to make any

527
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:16,540
aluminium for at least a year however

528
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:19,820
with this company it didn't happen

529
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:21,760
we know that they had to take all of

530
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:23,480
their computing systems offline

531
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,000
including the

532
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,860
PLC's controlling their factories but

533
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,380
they did it didn't lose a single factory

534
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:34,280
they were able to keep every factory

535
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:38,150
operating without computers how the hell

536
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:39,980
did you do that how on earth do you keep

537
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:42,140
a modern factory running without

538
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:44,450
computers well the answer is they were

539
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:50,810
able to do it because they still had

540
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:58,660
these you know old farts who remember

541
00:25:50,810 --> 00:26:01,909
how it used to be basically guys like me

542
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:04,790
basically guys like me who travels the

543
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:06,890
world carrying floppy disks and punch

544
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:08,990
cards do me remember these these how we

545
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:13,750
used to store information run a punch

546
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:18,470
card here we go fetch the cheap cheap

547
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:22,580
thank you don't put them on eBay so

548
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:25,880
these guys still remembered how it used

549
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:28,550
to be how factories used to operate

550
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,920
before we had PLC's before we had

551
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:34,330
computers who still had binders full of

552
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:37,250
papers with calculations and numbers

553
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:40,040
this is what saved these particular

554
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:44,090
factories now the question is how much

555
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:47,889
longer we'll be able to do this five

556
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:50,830
years ten years not much longer and

557
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:53,210
everything is becoming a computer

558
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:56,840
everything turns into a computer and

559
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:58,940
some of these devices that are turning

560
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,820
into computers have very very long life

561
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:04,070
cycles I think a prime example is cars

562
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:08,750
you look look at the car that you would

563
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:12,889
buy today clearly it's a computer modern

564
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:15,290
car is a data center of four wheels so

565
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:18,830
how long is that new car did you buy

566
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:20,480
today going to be on the roads if it's

567
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:24,620
not crashed it's gonna be on the roads

568
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:30,110
for I don't know 20 30 40 years 50 years

569
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:32,000
maybe maybe I'm right now driving a 19

570
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:34,610
year old car I plan on driving it for at

571
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,680
least 10 more years but as they are now

572
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:39,610
car

573
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:43,930
the question becomes how long will these

574
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:47,889
data centers be getting patches you know

575
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:50,980
security patches so I asked my Twitter

576
00:27:47,890 --> 00:27:52,870
followers and the consensus was that car

577
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:56,710
manufacturers should be providing

578
00:27:52,870 --> 00:28:01,300
patches for their cars for 25 years 25

579
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:03,580
years right now nobody's providing

580
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:05,770
security patches for anything for more

581
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,280
than 15 years typically more than five

582
00:28:05,770 --> 00:28:09,610
years

583
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:17,530
the only exception seems to be Windows

584
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:19,570
XP which simply refuses to die and when

585
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:22,450
we look at situation right now people

586
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:24,129
are really getting over-the-air updates

587
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,960
to their cars as they're driving around

588
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:29,110
but will they be getting the patches

589
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,790
when the car is 25 years old we really

590
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:32,320
don't know we don't know if this is

591
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:34,300
gonna be supportable everything is

592
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,919
becoming a computer some of these things

593
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:38,139
have very long life cycles and we have

594
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:40,000
no idea how the patches will be handled

595
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:46,180
when the device is gonna be 20 30 40

596
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:48,160
years old and we of course all know

597
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:51,430
about the patching which is right now

598
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:55,120
under way for these seven three seven

599
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:57,730
max eight when the patches for these

600
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:02,550
will be ready I wonder if they are also

601
00:28:57,730 --> 00:29:02,550
going to be over-the-air that jeez

602
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:09,430
sometimes we are developing new

603
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:11,170
technology and we fall in love with the

604
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:14,380
technology we could innovate something

605
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:18,750
great and we deploy and implement it

606
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:22,030
everywhere only to realize decades later

607
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:28,180
there was a horribly bad idea let me

608
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:29,830
play you a TV ad from 1950s smart woman

609
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:33,490
she's putting a new bra down by herself

610
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:36,220
wise woman she's using Gentile asbestos

611
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:38,320
tile easy it's going to install easiest

612
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:41,139
flooring to care for save everyone

613
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:44,350
with Ken tile vinyl asbestos tile Kent

614
00:29:41,139 --> 00:29:45,039
I'll buy the less bestest tiles best

615
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:47,649
idea ever

616
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,539
asbestos let's just put it everywhere

617
00:29:47,649 --> 00:29:52,629
like you know kitchen tiles and paint

618
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:54,879
and insulation and pipes and whatever

619
00:29:52,630 --> 00:29:57,159
well as asbestos was a great idea it was

620
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,880
a really remarkable really revolutionary

621
00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:03,460
material with great great benefits which

622
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,470
turned out to be a horribly bad idea and

623
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:09,720
what's happening right now around us

624
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:14,500
could eventually turn out to be IT

625
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:17,320
asbestos yeah let's turn everything into

626
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:20,289
a computer let's put everything on the

627
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:25,360
Internet let's take these horribly

628
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:29,169
insecure IOT devices running Linux with

629
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:31,479
a kernel from early 2000s and appeals

630
00:30:29,169 --> 00:30:34,090
and password which cannot be changed by

631
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:36,279
the customer and just deploy them

632
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:40,600
globally that's what we're doing today

633
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:42,820
and in 10 15 20 years we'll be looking

634
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:46,049
back at these years and scratching our

635
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:48,370
heads but what the hell were we thinking

636
00:30:46,049 --> 00:30:50,649
what we are creating right now could be

637
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:54,070
the next big headache that we have to

638
00:30:50,649 --> 00:31:00,250
worry about for the upcoming decades our

639
00:30:54,070 --> 00:31:03,759
IT asbestos mark my word and then we

640
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:06,039
have a totally different set of problems

641
00:31:03,759 --> 00:31:08,940
ahead of us in the future as we think

642
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:13,779
about what's happening with governments

643
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:17,350
now most organizations do not have to

644
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:21,250
worry about governmental attacks but

645
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:24,129
some organizations do and by the way

646
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:28,870
take a look at these guys March that's

647
00:31:24,129 --> 00:31:32,219
pretty neat I've seen your military

648
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:37,709
March it doesn't look like this

649
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:41,429
it doesn't look like this at all so

650
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:44,779
three weeks ago a lawyer in London got a

651
00:31:41,429 --> 00:31:44,779
phone call in the middle of the night

652
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:50,309
actually three calls mid missed calls

653
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:52,110
because he was asleep and the phone was

654
00:31:50,309 --> 00:31:54,450
silent when he woke up in the morning he

655
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:57,539
pick up the phone an iPhone looked at it

656
00:31:54,450 --> 00:32:00,149
and okay three missed calls from a phone

657
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:02,100
number which starts with plus four six

658
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:04,979
and that's the country code for Sweden

659
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:07,769
the lawyer was in London he's like weird

660
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:14,389
and they weren't phone calls they were

661
00:32:07,769 --> 00:32:18,289
video calls video calls / whatsapp and

662
00:32:14,389 --> 00:32:22,080
those calls in the middle of the night

663
00:32:18,289 --> 00:32:25,470
to a human rights lawyer in London three

664
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:28,289
weeks ago where the reason why you got a

665
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:30,570
patch for your phones and the attack

666
00:32:28,289 --> 00:32:33,750
that was targeting that human rights

667
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:37,408
lawyer was launched by an Israeli

668
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:39,990
company who was targeting well if not

669
00:32:37,409 --> 00:32:43,429
mr. Jamal Khashoggi himself at least his

670
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:46,139
personal friends after which this

671
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:52,740
journalist was brutally murdered by the

672
00:32:46,139 --> 00:32:55,320
Saudi Arabian government so why was this

673
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:58,110
company Israeli company targeting a

674
00:32:55,320 --> 00:33:01,080
human rights lawyer in London with

675
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:03,508
whatsapp zero-day vulnerability well

676
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,908
because he was running civil litigation

677
00:33:03,509 --> 00:33:09,330
against the company from people who had

678
00:33:05,909 --> 00:33:11,519
been targeted by rogue government's like

679
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:13,668
the Saudi government trying to gain

680
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:18,029
access to their mobile phones with

681
00:33:13,669 --> 00:33:20,909
unknown exploits and cases like these

682
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:23,340
are rare and this was deployment with

683
00:33:20,909 --> 00:33:26,639
zero day vulnerability our statistics on

684
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:29,220
how many times during a year we see a

685
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:31,408
real attack against real users using a

686
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:34,379
zero day vulnerability there's like 20

687
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:37,470
or 30 attacks like that every year it's

688
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:40,949
it's rare because zero days are rare and

689
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:42,539
zero days are valuable attackers don't

690
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:44,840
like to use them because then you lose

691
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:44,840
them

692
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:51,600
this particular attack means that all of

693
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:54,000
us got a whatsapp update last week and

694
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,909
if you haven't updated your whatsapp you

695
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,050
should although it's not really obvious

696
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:59,790
why you should if you look at the

697
00:33:58,050 --> 00:34:01,200
release notes for the patch at PAX

698
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:02,639
strict it doesn't speak anything about

699
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:07,890
the zero day vulnerability speaks about

700
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:10,980
new stickers nevertheless update your

701
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:14,220
whatsapp so the nature of conflict

702
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:18,929
around us is changing we used to be

703
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:22,589
fighting traditional Wars for thousands

704
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:27,418
of years wars were we were fighting each

705
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:29,730
other with bow and arrows and swords but

706
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:32,730
technology has always been shaping the

707
00:34:29,730 --> 00:34:34,440
face of conflict and the face of war has

708
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:37,590
we got good enough technology to take

709
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:41,700
the war to seas with it by building

710
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:46,820
warships creating air see war and then

711
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:51,149
air war technology shapes how we fight

712
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:54,980
but the innovation of C war an air war

713
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:59,100
did not take land war away conflict just

714
00:34:54,980 --> 00:35:00,510
expands into new domains then we got

715
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:03,690
satellites and

716
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:07,140
which means space war and now we got

717
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:08,940
cyber space war and if you look at a

718
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:11,400
modern conflict like let's say Russia

719
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:14,970
Ukraine they are fighting that war in

720
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:19,530
every single domain land air sea space

721
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:24,270
and cyberspace and this will not be the

722
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:27,320
end of domains where we can fight there

723
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:30,240
will be new domains like I don't know

724
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:33,690
one day robots will be doing the

725
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:37,830
fighting or we will be fighting DNA

726
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:40,020
warfare or I don't know nano for warfare

727
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:42,930
which sounds like science fiction today

728
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:44,490
but then again so did cyber war sound

729
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:45,890
like science fiction just a couple of

730
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:48,479
decades ago

731
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:52,290
and then I suppose eventually we will

732
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:54,630
end up with machine learning and AI

733
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:58,590
based conflict and you don't have to

734
00:35:54,630 --> 00:36:03,780
believe me on that you can take the

735
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:05,870
from President Putin to MU digital

736
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:09,980
currency the Buddhists even challenged

737
00:36:05,870 --> 00:36:13,730
this colossal and they was molested in

738
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:23,880
the pregnancy with the new grossing

739
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:27,600
don't regional leader inverter is fairly

740
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:32,340
standard leader on Mira who is the

741
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:36,589
leader in AI will lead the world the

742
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:39,510
good news is that right now today

743
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:44,550
machine learning is basically only used

744
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:47,310
by the good guys it's not yet being used

745
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:49,470
by bad guys security companies including

746
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:51,390
everyone every single security company

747
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:53,879
here will tell you about how they use

748
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:56,549
machine learning to build defenses and

749
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:59,220
we aren't really yet seeing attackers

750
00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:02,700
doing that but that's gonna change as

751
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:04,830
well eventually deployment of machine

752
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:07,770
learning and AI systems will become so

753
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:09,750
easy to use that any idiot will be able

754
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:12,180
to use them and then we will start

755
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:14,430
seeing self morphing malware which

756
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:17,339
learns or phishing attacks using machine

757
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:22,790
learning tactics all of these will

758
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:22,790
happen hasn't happened yet but it will

759
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:30,270
so criminals are different from

760
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:34,080
governments criminals go after the

761
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:35,730
low-hanging fruit when criminals tried

762
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:38,270
to gain access to your network they're

763
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:41,640
not really after you they're after money

764
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:43,680
if it's too hard too slow too expensive

765
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,150
to gain access to your network they will

766
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:48,359
go after an easier target

767
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:50,250
and believe me the Internet is a garden

768
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:55,260
of low-hanging fruits they'll easily

769
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:57,390
find easier places to hack so to fight

770
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:59,460
criminal attackers you don't have to

771
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:03,359
have perfect security just have to have

772
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:06,990
a little bit better security than the

773
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:10,650
other targets but then when you are

774
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:12,379
facing government's the rules are

775
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:15,630
different

776
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:19,140
governmental attackers don't give up if

777
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:20,400
they can't get in they will try again if

778
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,500
they still can't get in

779
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,680
they will try again and if the attacker

780
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:27,990
just never gives up it's likely that

781
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:31,379
sooner or later they will get in and

782
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:34,229
that makes them such a hard target or

783
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:40,380
such a hard enemy to fight when you are

784
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:43,860
the target and that means my friends and

785
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:46,790
colleagues that the time use of building

786
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:51,150
walls around our networks are over

787
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:52,980
we can't keep all the attackers out even

788
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:55,320
if they're not governmental if they are

789
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:57,690
persistent enough they will get in if

790
00:38:55,320 --> 00:39:01,950
you have large enough Network they will

791
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:05,070
get in so we have to stop thinking about

792
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:06,839
how we could build stronger walls and

793
00:39:05,070 --> 00:39:10,920
start focusing on what's happening

794
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:14,070
inside of the walls so we're able to

795
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:21,480
detect when there's a breach so we can

796
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:23,400
respond when there's a bridge and if you

797
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:25,770
think about how much the world changed

798
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:29,190
during 25 short years from my trip to

799
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:32,850
Austria and renting a boat and how it

800
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:34,410
seems impossible to now understand how

801
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:38,250
you could even do that without the

802
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:40,830
internet well we are facing exactly our

803
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:42,840
large change in the future as well the

804
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:45,299
things we now take for granted will seem

805
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:51,230
like ancient history in very short time

806
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:56,070
and that means that your job my job our

807
00:39:51,230 --> 00:40:01,320
job is not to check your computers our

808
00:39:56,070 --> 00:40:05,120
job is to secure the society thank you

809
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:05,120
for your work thank you very much

810
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:14,040
that was wonderful Mako that's one of

811
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:15,480
the best opening keynote we've had it

812
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:18,060
also can ask you a quick question

813
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,380
here's country thank you in the in the

814
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:21,960
same way as you had that moment with

815
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:24,060
your younger colleague I won with my

816
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,430
daughter I was explaining to her I was

817
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:28,890
saying probably the single thing that

818
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:31,560
makes her life most different to mine

819
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:33,600
and I'd pick this up and I said it that

820
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,870
these things are now mobile I said in my

821
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:37,170
day

822
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:40,020
phones were connected and before I had a

823
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:42,420
chance to say to the wall or to her desk

824
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:46,920
or whatever she hopped in and said you

825
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:48,540
mean like to your pants and I did just

826
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,560
think for that how cool would have been

827
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:51,420
that you're outlined okay that's what

828
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:55,500
I'll call them I'm not wearing my phone

829
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:57,180
pants damn but might I use my phone a

830
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,860
lot of my kids it's like they're

831
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:02,160
surgically attached in the space of

832
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:04,890
mobile where are we at on security

833
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,230
versus lack of security mm-hmm many

834
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:10,740
people especially Outsiders of our field

835
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:12,390
somehow believe that mobile devices like

836
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:13,649
phones and tablets would be less secure

837
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:15,839
than computers because you know they're

838
00:41:13,650 --> 00:41:17,790
smaller and I don't know easier to lose

839
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:19,530
things like that but of course these are

840
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:21,330
more secure than real computers because

841
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:23,610
they are much more restricted the main

842
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:25,860
restriction is the app store or play

843
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:27,630
model the idea that you can't just

844
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:29,400
randomly write software and deploy and

845
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:31,290
run it on every device it has to go

846
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,990
through checks before it's downloaded

847
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:35,850
from an app store and that really is the

848
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:37,859
reason why we don't see malware on

849
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:39,960
mobile devices and that's why I'm a bit

850
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:42,600
worried about what's happening right now

851
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:44,760
especially about the fact that Apple is

852
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,770
being taken in to Supreme Court in the

853
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:49,370
United States as they are being accused

854
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:51,960
of monopoly model with the App Store and

855
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:54,240
they're right it is a monopoly but it's

856
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,860
a secure monopoly and if the end result

857
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,930
of that is that app store is killed and

858
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:59,940
iPhone users will start downloading

859
00:41:57,930 --> 00:42:01,950
their applications from random websites

860
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:03,060
we will end up with exactly the same

861
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:06,149
problems we used to have on our

862
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:07,830
computers when most people in this room

863
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:10,590
obviously get it and I presume they're

864
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:12,930
personal and work security is pretty

865
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:15,120
high when you're talking to that average

866
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:17,100
person who just needs to be a little bit

867
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,660
better what's what's the single thing if

868
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:19,839
you could do one thing with just your

869
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:22,060
random person

870
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:24,370
in their home devices will work what's

871
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:26,850
the one thing someone can do to

872
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:30,299
massively decrease their risk profile

873
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:33,870
it's quite depressing that we are in

874
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:36,040
2019 and we are still using passwords

875
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:37,720
passwords which were invented pretty

876
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:40,120
much when in internet was invented like

877
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:42,220
you know 70s or something like that it's

878
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:44,170
way way overdue to get rid of that so my

879
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:46,120
advice to the average person on the

880
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:48,580
street is always password managers I

881
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:50,650
don't even try to manage your passwords

882
00:42:48,580 --> 00:42:53,020
because every single guidance and rule

883
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:54,430
and helpful article in newspapers

884
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:56,920
telling you how to pick a good password

885
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:58,870
is always wrong because it's always the

886
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:01,720
same goddamn advice about picking a

887
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:03,009
really long and complex password make

888
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,870
sure it has lots of uppercase lowercase

889
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:06,160
numbers and punctuation and make sure

890
00:43:04,870 --> 00:43:08,200
it's completely different on every

891
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,549
website and don't write it down which is

892
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,899
basically saying that you know come up

893
00:43:09,550 --> 00:43:12,960
with something that you absolutely can't

894
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:15,430
remember but don't write it down

895
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,080
obviously you can't do that the only way

896
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:19,000
they can do is password managers and

897
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:21,100
that's my tip number one great I'm gonna

898
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:22,120
get you to sign Oh ponch carbone there

899
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:27,009
give him another round of applause that

900
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:28,240
was just wonderful you'll be hearing

901
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:30,870
from me a little bit over the next

902
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,870
couple of days
