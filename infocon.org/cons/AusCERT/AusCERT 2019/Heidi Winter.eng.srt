1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:05,970
well everyone's just the last people

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:07,500
coming in so welcome to the first of the

3
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,790
concurrent sessions this morning I'm

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,559
gonna get just jump straight into what

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,799
if we could save questions to the end to

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,030
guys you know pass the microphone around

7
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:18,359
it's with great pleasure I introduce

8
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:21,090
Heidi winter with catch me if you can

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:29,310
the art of CTF give her a big applause

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:30,929
guys good morning uh sir so I have a bit

11
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,780
of a Content warning here at the

12
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:35,309
beginning of this talk so I did give

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,550
this talk a couple of months ago in

14
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:40,140
Cairo and I got some feedbacks and from

15
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,149
people who feed the video saying that

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,370
it's probably not very appropriate for

17
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,350
us cert I needed to tone down on the

18
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,480
memes a little bit this is this is a

19
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:51,300
professional conference so I went

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,610
through and changed all the text and the

21
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,288
pictures and made a little businessí and

22
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:56,910
things along those lines and then about

23
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:58,770
6:00 a.m. this morning I got really

24
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:02,190
angry and put in more cat names instead

25
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,570
so this is about 200% cat memes then you

26
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:10,170
probably would actually normally be

27
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:12,780
exposed to so so hi I'm Heidi you can

28
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:16,740
find me on twitter as winter underscore

29
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:20,070
Heidi I have a little CTF team called

30
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:26,280
cult of the party part where our female

31
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:29,658
team Oh girls LGBTQIA and B+ team so if

32
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:31,920
you or anyone is interested in joining

33
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:34,740
CTF team at the end of this please come

34
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,140
see me I've done a lot of things in

35
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:41,399
security over the years but most likely

36
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:44,909
you can see find me giving kids lessons

37
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:50,220
I run capture-the-flag classes for high

38
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:51,960
school kids and go guides nicely so I've

39
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,090
done a lot of things in security I've

40
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,339
worked many places as a consultant and

41
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:58,229
direct employee but while my history's

42
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,939
in telecommunications and enterprise

43
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:01,200
systems development I've had the

44
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:03,658
pleasure of working with security in

45
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,030
many spaces from compliance to malware

46
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,979
analysis and at the moment I'm working

47
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,229
with blue team's setting up security

48
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,210
operations but the thing I love most is

49
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,770
giving back to the community and

50
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,420
couraging others to find their passions

51
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,100
in space so I do a lot of work with

52
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,739
adults and kids playing capture the flag

53
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:23,460
games for education of fun and I find it

54
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:25,500
pretty rewarding so this is designers on

55
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:27,690
what I want talk so it will start off

56
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,990
with what is the capture the flag game

57
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,550
so this is a picture of Def Con actually

58
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,640
this is taken from the Wikipedia page

59
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:38,310
should have cooked so capture the flag

60
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,779
games competitions and puzzles based on

61
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,940
real world information security

62
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,860
vulnerabilities and challenges that are

63
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,109
played online or at security events and

64
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:47,610
conferences individuals are teams race

65
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:49,890
against the clock

66
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:52,800
solving competitions and fun exercises

67
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:55,049
gathering flags to earn points it's not

68
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,590
actually people running around in fields

69
00:02:55,050 --> 00:03:00,420
trying to get flags it's an opportunity

70
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,480
for existing and new skills to meet and

71
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:06,299
grow in a great environment so there's a

72
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:09,149
couple of different game styles so

73
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,100
there's standalone games there's what's

74
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:15,510
called jeopardy games and attack and

75
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:17,549
defend games so stand alone in the blue

76
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:20,910
sort of context you're looking at bosses

77
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:22,920
a sock where you can look through data

78
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,829
sets and find different flags and get

79
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:29,010
points over the wire which is a really

80
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:32,100
good set of games which are available to

81
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:35,429
play individually and also we've got

82
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:38,670
hack the box and also valid so you can

83
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:40,890
download vulnerable machines and they're

84
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:43,140
great for practicing on they're not

85
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,000
always event base and they're always

86
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:49,410
available as you play they get

87
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,800
progressively harder jeopardy so you've

88
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:55,770
got good examples of these pker CTF

89
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:57,270
we've got seesaw CTF Facebook's ETFs on

90
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:59,820
this weekend as well if you wanted to

91
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:04,650
give that a go they're staying up again

92
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:07,440
and you've got a lot of that available

93
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,390
on CTF time so CTF time I'll be posting

94
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,980
all of these links later on I did

95
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:14,190
originally actually have them sitting

96
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:16,320
within the slides but I go past them too

97
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,730
quickly it wouldn't be very valuable to

98
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,440
you so I'll be a post anymore online

99
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,489
later

100
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,930
CTF time is really good because you can

101
00:04:20,488 --> 00:04:23,700
see this - what's actually coming up and

102
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:26,100
what's available

103
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,390
so there's aa different playstyles that

104
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:29,160
you can actually do when it comes to

105
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:31,260
these games so you can play individually

106
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,170
on your own if you want to when it comes

107
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:40,140
to online or you can get a team and work

108
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:42,180
together on challenges so there's a lot

109
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:47,039
there's a lot of different types of

110
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:49,320
games as well but so we've got things

111
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,840
along the lines of binary exploitation

112
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,890
cryptography steganography social

113
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,659
engineering vulnerable web forensics

114
00:04:54,890 --> 00:05:01,430
networking physical security vinyl

115
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:03,840
virtual reality virtual and like mobile

116
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:06,480
open source intelligence and pretty much

117
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,310
anything you can come up with so when I

118
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:10,260
was at Def Con last year I could met

119
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:11,640
this guy sitting on a rock staring at

120
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,590
flamingoes with me and we were chatting

121
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,900
about CTFs and he said to me the one

122
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:17,340
good thing about CTFs is that you get to

123
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:19,409
learn a lot about the person it's

124
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:21,479
actually putting the CTF together so

125
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:22,950
basically the person whoever actually

126
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,150
puts it together and the challenges that

127
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,250
they put together are what you're

128
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:29,130
actually having to work through and so

129
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:33,240
it gives you of exponential options and

130
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:38,100
also things that you can play through so

131
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:41,250
I I've been working in IT for about 20

132
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:43,170
years now so I don't trust technology at

133
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:45,870
all so I was gonna put together a video

134
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:49,020
as to an example as to like the small

135
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:51,090
CTF but so you're just gonna have to go

136
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:55,200
through one at a time this is from

137
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:58,260
Christchurch hacker Con in 2018 so you

138
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:01,200
start off with a PDF and you try to open

139
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:06,539
it up and it's not actually a PDF at all

140
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:07,950
so you do basic like file inspection

141
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,270
depending on the actual system that

142
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,550
you're working with and how you go about

143
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,620
things when I first started doing these

144
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:15,750
I'll just go straight to doing hex

145
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:17,160
inspection and actually having a look of

146
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,470
like what the headers were on the

147
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,900
particular files but in this case it

148
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:23,280
turns out it's actually a P cap and so

149
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,620
you open it up in Wireshark

150
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,109
have a look for the contents and turns

151
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:31,170
out there's actually files embedded that

152
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:34,800
you can download so you pull them out as

153
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:36,150
download via SMB and then have a look at

154
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,210
that particular file

155
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:42,690
and turns out that that itself is

156
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:44,969
actually a zip file and that's how it

157
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:46,620
does keep scouring and so that's it

158
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:50,610
files got a couple of images inside it

159
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:53,669
and then you extract that and you've got

160
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:55,979
different images the first image I'm

161
00:06:53,669 --> 00:06:57,419
having to look at it in a couple of

162
00:06:55,979 --> 00:07:01,260
different ways and it turns out that

163
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:02,760
it's actually got the CTF flag is

164
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:05,159
actually embedded within the image

165
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,210
itself and changing you can do this in a

166
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,770
couple of different ways

167
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,780
you can even brute force it with

168
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:12,690
specific tools or you can just mess

169
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,698
around with it in GIMP and she can't see

170
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,530
it too well but in the right-hand corner

171
00:07:14,699 --> 00:07:19,260
you can actually see the flags actually

172
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:24,030
embedded so in the moving onto one of

173
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:25,440
the other pictures you've got having a

174
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,760
look at it you're like going okay what

175
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,710
is it oh it turns out that this is

176
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,870
actually embedded within the access

177
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:35,010
information within that particular file

178
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:37,740
so and then that particular comment

179
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:39,599
actually leads you on to further hints

180
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,789
as to the rest of the challenges that

181
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:45,000
are in that so I think if you actually

182
00:07:41,789 --> 00:07:46,919
look up itrex that ends up with being a

183
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,750
hint towards veracrypt and one of the

184
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:50,760
other files that's a password for the

185
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,560
video just keep on going and going and

186
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:56,099
going getting flagged as you go along

187
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,570
this is actually part of their CTF for

188
00:07:56,099 --> 00:08:02,070
their actual conference last year and

189
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:04,440
it's pretty cool so with the stagger

190
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:07,469
you've got things like exif tools so you

191
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:09,120
can go and have a look when you need to

192
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,789
actually view the access of information

193
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,349
on the files stack cracker is like going

194
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:15,260
to need to actually brute force to

195
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:17,430
uncover the data which is pretty useful

196
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,740
GIMP was the tool I was just using

197
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:21,930
before to mess around with the hues so

198
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,099
if you've not really sure what's

199
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,510
actually in there and you just want to

200
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:28,020
have a play around with it it's an

201
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:31,260
option for you to have it go with and

202
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:33,829
just inspecting like files for the

203
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:36,299
actual having to have a look at the hex

204
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:38,640
so when you're moving on to things like

205
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:41,458
reversing challenges something I find

206
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,809
pretty useful is been walk which is good

207
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:46,239
for reversing and extracting the

208
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:49,089
analyzing notes and well gira

209
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,800
thanks NSA it's a free and open-source

210
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:53,439
reverse engineering tool I actually

211
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:55,029
haven't used it I've been using an eider

212
00:08:53,439 --> 00:08:57,248
for most of the stuff that I've been

213
00:08:55,029 --> 00:08:58,839
playing around with for a while and I

214
00:08:57,249 --> 00:09:01,809
haven't really had too much of a reason

215
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:05,499
to give up the tools ago and I quite

216
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:08,199
like I de binary ninja so it's your

217
00:09:05,499 --> 00:09:10,569
friend for binary analysis anger is

218
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:12,729
actually pretty cool it's binary

219
00:09:10,569 --> 00:09:15,759
analysis framework which when used

220
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:19,509
properly can be used in CTF to concha

221
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:21,189
processing time so one thing that's

222
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:23,410
actually not done very much in Australia

223
00:09:21,189 --> 00:09:28,929
but is done quite a lot overseas as

224
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:30,480
social engineering cts and we do have

225
00:09:28,929 --> 00:09:33,490
some open source intelligence

226
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,800
so other than CTS working around here

227
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:38,259
there's one that runs out a Sydney which

228
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:41,229
is pretty cool things that you can use

229
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:43,720
in that is billing routes toolkit it's

230
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:45,790
an online investigation toolkit with a

231
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,999
list of tools used for verification and

232
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,360
open source investigations awesome

233
00:09:48,999 --> 00:09:52,839
oesn't

234
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,009
is a curated list of oesn't resources if

235
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:55,449
you're interested in having a look at

236
00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:58,420
social engineering and the different

237
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:59,740
challenges and those sort of things have

238
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:02,559
a look at social engineer to come

239
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:05,439
they've got a lot of podcasts and

240
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:07,779
resources on that particular subject and

241
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:09,610
there's also a really good book called

242
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:11,199
the science of human hacking as well

243
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:16,569
which is why far checking out by Chris

244
00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:21,309
hadn't it had Janee so I have a six step

245
00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:26,679
formula for playing CTF and some tap

246
00:10:21,309 --> 00:10:31,240
meme edition obviously so game approach

247
00:10:26,679 --> 00:10:34,529
when you give me an X CTF ago just play

248
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,529
a game watch again

249
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:42,450
be context aware so when you're actually

250
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:45,420
having a look at the different CTF games

251
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:47,430
and the different actual puzzles that

252
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:50,370
you're working on obviously don't try to

253
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:55,620
run stego on files that are associated

254
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:58,620
with yeah I've completely different

255
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:01,320
challenges have a look at the program

256
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,510
you're working on when it comes to

257
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:04,530
previous write-ups for other CTF

258
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:07,770
especially when you're dealing with

259
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:09,000
hints you can actually find that there's

260
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:10,560
actually quite a lot of resources

261
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,210
available online which should give you

262
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,729
especially when you're starting off

263
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:18,390
playing CTF as to how to actually

264
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:20,700
approach particular programs and use

265
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:23,970
your available resources whether or not

266
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,410
it's people or whether or not it's just

267
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:28,380
the different tools that you've actually

268
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:30,329
got have a look at you actual different

269
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:32,700
chats that you may have access to and

270
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:36,180
slacks and groups along those particular

271
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:38,490
alliance and don't be put off they're

272
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:39,870
pretty hard especially when you first to

273
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:43,140
start off and you're not really sure as

274
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:44,510
to where to actually go but if you just

275
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,740
keep it up and keep it going

276
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:50,010
Google it's actually really really

277
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:52,440
rewarding and once you give it a go and

278
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:54,210
whether or not you actually manage to do

279
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,700
very well you first capture the flag

280
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:58,710
game that you have to go out just return

281
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,660
to step one and keep going and do it a

282
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:03,780
little bit more make it a little bit

283
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:05,459
more effort so you can also extend these

284
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:07,350
particular skills that you use when it

285
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:11,220
comes to the capture the flag games into

286
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:14,160
other areas as well so you can extend

287
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,480
them into bug bounties depending on the

288
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,120
actual challenges that you're actually

289
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:20,510
doing pen testing some of the particular

290
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,740
skills can be appropriate deer fire

291
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:25,230
we've got the incident response and

292
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:27,030
analysis side of things I have to say

293
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:29,760
that a couple months ago I went off and

294
00:12:27,030 --> 00:12:31,890
did forensics training and I found it

295
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,560
significantly a lot easier because I've

296
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:36,180
been doing forensic CTF challenges the

297
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,030
last couple years just trying to work

298
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:40,439
out what I was actually doing in them so

299
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:41,880
when I went off and did the forensics

300
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,590
training I'm like oh I know all of this

301
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,189
oh wait I can use these tools and it's

302
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:48,320
actually easy oh that's sweet

303
00:12:46,190 --> 00:12:50,030
and you can go off and make your own CTF

304
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,800
as well so there's a lot of different

305
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:54,319
platforms you can actually run off so

306
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:57,260
CTF de which is available so you can

307
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,760
actually host your own locally or you

308
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:00,920
can actually pay a subscription and

309
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:04,720
they'll actually just host it for you

310
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:07,550
it's amazingly simple Neverland CTF is

311
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:10,340
CTF which is over in the States run by a

312
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:13,250
bunch of kids that came out of the roots

313
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:16,280
program which is the kids DEFCON area

314
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:18,350
they run their own CTS annually now and

315
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:21,350
there's a lot of resources they've got

316
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:24,320
available online to run your own face

317
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:26,090
book CTF Facebook put out their own

318
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,400
platform which looks extremely pretty

319
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:32,060
and has lots of maps and spinny things

320
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:34,040
but is probably well it's a bit bulky

321
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:35,209
let's just say for the CTF this year

322
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:38,209
they're actually using the C T FD

323
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:41,510
platform which is says a lot and there's

324
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:42,860
also open CTF as well sorry doesn't more

325
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:49,280
than a few platforms that you can

326
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:50,960
actually run these on your own so I came

327
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,910
down with a massive cold yesterday so

328
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,620
