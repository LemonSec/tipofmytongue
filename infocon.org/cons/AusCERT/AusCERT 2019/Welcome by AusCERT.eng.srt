all if I can explain how this works in a

57
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:05,100
non indigenous non traditional sense I'm

58
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:07,680
hosting a party tomorrow night

59
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,179
and you're one of the invited guests the

60
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,800
way you would come to my party is you

61
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,880
would open you wouldn't just come to my

62
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,440
door you wouldn't just

63
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,210
you wouldn't just knock on my front door

64
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,010
and you wouldn't just walk into my house

65
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:21,730
you would have to wait for me to invite

66
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:23,230
you in you wouldn't just open my fridge

67
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:24,970
just start eating my food and start

68
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:28,060
drinking my drinks you wouldn't do that

69
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:29,710
that would be disrespectful so welcome

70
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,690
in traditional sense it's how we operate

71
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:33,340
today which is when we go to someone's

72
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:35,290
house which you guys are in my house

73
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:37,240
right now you would come and knock on my

74
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:39,519
door I would answer the door and choose

75
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,780
whether or not to let you win if I

76
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,310
didn't want you to come into my house

77
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,230
you would have to turn around and go

78
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:47,080
away but this morning I'm going to

79
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:48,609
welcome you all into my home so now that

80
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:50,710
you have permission to enter my house

81
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:53,350
open my fridge and start eating my fruit

82
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:55,060
and drinking my drinks if we hold that

83
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:57,460
thought of what a welcome to country is

84
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,830
it is me opening my home and my lands to

85
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:02,860
you in an indigenous sense in Aboriginal

86
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:04,840
stance in days gone by not by us we have

87
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,700
a similar fashion but we didn't have a

88
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:08,170
fridge we didn't have a door and we

89
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:10,899
didn't have a mobile phone or anything

90
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:12,549
like that so you would go to the edge of

91
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:14,170
your country and try to get the

92
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:17,410
attention of the neighboring people next

93
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:19,420
door one way we would get the attention

94
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,430
of the neighboring the neighboring

95
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,589
people next door would we go to the

96
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:25,030
border the border between my land and

97
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:27,880
the next person's land could have been a

98
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:30,490
river a stream a set of trees or just a

99
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,650
rock and we would get to that rock and

100
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:34,210
would light a big fire the fire would

101
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,640
produce smoke and that smoke was a

102
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:38,020
signal to the custodians the owners of

103
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,329
the land or which you wanted to gain

104
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,770
entry to to say hey there's some people

105
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:44,080
at the border I think we should go over

106
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:45,640
and see who it is so the Warriors or

107
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,250
some of the men would go over to the

108
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:50,500
border and light the fire it would

109
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:52,660
basically say hello what do you want and

110
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,290
you would say hey I'd like to fish in

111
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,730
your river

112
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:56,560
we know that the mullet is running now

113
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,179
and we would like to come and hunt the

114
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,470
mullet to feed our children do you give

115
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,660
us permission to do this

116
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,730
the Warriors would then take the message

117
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,950
back to the leader of the tribe and pass

118
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:08,019
those words on it was up to the elder

119
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:09,399
whether or not to let you in so in this

120
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:11,230
case we've said yes

121
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:13,060
then the Warriors would return to your

122
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,340
fire and say you have a mission to gain

123
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,048
entry into our land and to fish the

124
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:19,480
river for the mullet but you must adopt

125
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:21,880
our rules and our laws have for you to

126
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,790
come in to and hunt our mullet you can

127
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,700
only bring in two worries to come and

128
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:27,200
fish whatever

129
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:29,690
Karrie is what you get to take home to

130
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:32,210
feed your family respectfully we would

131
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:34,490
have 100% pay the law thought there were

132
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,260
ten men waiting at the fire only two men

133
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,930
would gain entry and the other eight

134
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:41,120
would wait the other two men would go in

135
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,710
and fish and hunt until they got enough

136
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,960
mullet they could carry and they would

137
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,549
all leave together so when I say I

138
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,930

the rules about fishing for mullet in

154
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,270
Australia where we're exceptionally

155
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,670
proud of the fact that our indigenous

156
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,469
culture stretches back tens of thousands

157
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:26,660
possibly sixty thousand years so we

158
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,160
thank our indigenous forebears for their

159
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:31,040
custodianship of the land upon which we

160
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,890

196
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:37,490
we've got enough breaks during the

197
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,810
course that I just look up free yourself

198
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:40,430
on the screens and soak

199
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,320
what's going on here on the stage I

200
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:44,120
accept in this group that's a bigger

201
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,500
challenge than it is in some but if you

202
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,760
can break away from the screens the

203
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,440
presentations we got here today are

204
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,780
quite amazing most of you should have

00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,880
installed the conference app by now use

206
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,380
that for writing the presentations check

207
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,610
in at each booth during the passport to

208
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,440
win prizes and all that sort of stuff

209
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:00,620
and we're particularly excited the good

210
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:03,710
people at context are hosting a pone -

211
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:04,940
drone challenge now the objective of

212
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:07,010
this challenge is to allow participants

213
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,300
to try their skills in controlled semi

214
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,800
representative industrial control

215
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,150
systems which include a fully

216
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,440
functioning Scott and network including

217
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,090
controllable traffic lights smart meters

218
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,219
pump water storage simulated smoke fire

219
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,500
effects once players have compromised

220
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,580
the network from the IT DMZ propagating

221
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,320
through the operational television

222
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,320
network possible to compromise and

223
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,719
capture I've got no idea what I'm saying

224
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:28,130
as often happens for me it also most of

225
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,110
the individual words and that paragraph

226
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:31,700
makes sense to me they have been placed

227
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,740
together in an order that render them

228
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:37,010
gibberish but I'm told it's a rocking

229

home the Operations Manager across cert

00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:32,950
you thank you David welcome everyone

305
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:34,959
really excited to be here now that theme

306
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:37,690
that wasn't actually chosen just for its

307
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,910
retro-gaming coolness where we were

308
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:41,040
actually trying to

309
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:42,600
encourage a balanced information

310
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,209
security program

311
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:46,410
hence the you know defense and depth

312
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:48,450
strategy everything that we've all

313
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:50,969
learned but it sort of ties in really

314
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:53,550
nicely with don't go it alone

315
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:55,380
so what does that mean for us it doesn't

316
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:56,790
mean that we're here to replace any

317
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,210
government departments or anything like

318
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,860
that

319
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,940
government agencies it doesn't mean

320
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,160
we're here to replace any of those

321
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,930
vendors out there it's quite different

322
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,750
we're actually very passionate about

323
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:09,660
delivering world-class cybersecurity

324
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:11,820
services that are unique and we want to

325
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,140
do it at a not for profit rate so that's

326
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:16,860
why we're all here that's why everyone

327
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,880
works in awe cert the we're actually at

328
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,980
the moment we're very excited about

329
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:22,110
planning what we're doing next year so

330
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,570
you know you've got to look ahead so

331
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:26,160
what we really want from you from our

332
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:28,320
members is we want you to come and visit

333
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,180
our booth so our booth is sort of at the

334
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,610
intersection of the the two aisle ways

335
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:34,469
and throughout the whole conference in

336
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:36,450
next two days and our wonderful

337
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:38,790
Membership team Nick and Megan will be

338
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:40,790
there so they've actually got a short

339
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:44,219
survey that we would really like you to

340
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:45,719
to complete it's it's just asking you

341
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,670
know what are you using in our services

342
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,680
what do you want from our services going

343
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:51,300
forward so we'd really love it if you

344
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,870
could if you could participate in that

345
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:56,880
during the breaks also our analysts will

346
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:58,260
be at the stand so if you want to

347
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,060
actually talk to any of the analysts

348
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:03,870
just come and find us at morning tea

349
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:07,380
afternoon tea and lunch okay speaking of

350
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:09,660
our members we're actually really proud

351
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,430
to say that and quite a number of our

352
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:13,620
members have been able to integrate our

353
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:15,569
services into their business processes

354
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,310
that's what this is all about obviously

355
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,020
it's not just technology anymore with as

356
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:21,780
David said we've got to think of people

357
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:24,300
process technology so one of the

358
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:26,939
examples of that is the information

359
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,439
sharing and analysis center that we

360
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,680
we've operated now for a little while

361
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:34,890
for the universities we actually just

362
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:37,500
got a finalist at status in the quarter

363
00:12:34,890 --> 00:12:39,930
Awards last week for that we're

364
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,690
extremely proud of Nick's oysters one of

365
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:44,310
our senior analysts who's who heads up

366
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:46,020
that Isaac but we're really proud of the

367
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:47,699
whole team because to actually get that

368
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:49,949
recognition for that Isaac was just

369
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:51,730
wonderful and the Victorian government

370
00:12:49,950 --> 00:12:53,889
had already put all of all

371
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,750
membership services into their business

372
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:57,880
processes for their information security

373
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:59,350
management program but the next thing

374
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:02,019
they did is they've rolled out our new

375
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,910
training across all of their state

376
00:13:02,019 --> 00:13:05,589
departments so that everyone can benefit

377
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:08,829
from all sets expertise and we were

378
00:13:05,589 --> 00:13:10,540
really excited about that too um so I

379
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:12,130
suppose it's really good to see that

380
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:13,540
it's it isn't just about the tech

381
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,490
anymore it is about the people and

382
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:16,779
that's where that training came in all

383
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,010
right so that brings me to something

384
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:19,689
I've been really looking forward to

385
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:21,760
doing and that is launching a whole lot

386
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:23,380
of new products so David has already

387
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,529
hinted out it I just hinted at it we're

388
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:28,449
now doing training again so what we're

389
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:30,339
going to do is over the next month or so

390
00:13:28,449 --> 00:13:31,449
we'll launch that officially and we'll

391
00:13:30,339 --> 00:13:32,860
get all the information out to our

392
00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:34,529
members about the courses that we're

393
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,029
offering so there's things like

394
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:38,980
obviously Incident Response that's kind

395
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:40,990
of a cert teams bread-and-butter so

396
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,699
we're obviously very keen to impart our

397
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,949
knowledge on that but we've also done

398
00:13:42,699 --> 00:13:47,709
some courses on planning your incident

399
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:49,750
response now that's that might sound

400
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:51,040
like a bit of an overlap but it's

401
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:53,860
actually not you've got to plan these

402
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,439
things in advance so those courses will

403
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:59,050
be announced really really soon so over

404
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,490
the next month or so the next thing I

405
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:02,109
wanted to announce is something that

406
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:04,510
we've all been very excited about

407
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:06,430
internally and we've got a few of you on

408
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:09,550
the pilot for this and that say our AUSA

409
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:11,079
daily intelligence report I found before

410
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:14,170
I worked in also where I was surrounded

411
00:14:11,079 --> 00:14:15,760
by analysts that know everything that's

412
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:18,459
going on all the time in cybersecurity

413
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,930
news I felt like when I worked in a bank

414
00:14:18,459 --> 00:14:21,399
I felt like I was in a bit of a vacuum I

415
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,739
didn't really know what was going on in

416
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:25,300
the world so it was really refreshing to

417
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:28,029
see all the analysts talking about all

418
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,229
these infoset news articles and we sort

419
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:30,550
of looked at that and we went well and

420
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:33,100
members probably want to hear that too

421
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:34,899
so it's now a daily report that you can

422
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,069
subscribe to in a couple of weeks we'll

423
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:38,170
just be able to switch it on in our

424
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:39,729
member portal at the moment if you want

425
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:40,959
to enable it immediately if you can't

426
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:42,550
wait for that you can just see our

427
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,010
membership team and they'll turn it on

428
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:47,620
in your in your email subscriptions and

429
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:49,600
it's just a daily report of some curated

430
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,920
news articles that our analysts thought

431
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:53,649
would be relevant to you

432
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:56,019
so that was exciting and the very last

433
00:14:53,649 --> 00:14:57,519
thing I want to mention I mentioned

434
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:59,949
we're doing a nice act for the

435
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,940
university so the Isacc is information

436
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:03,439
sharing and analysis Center

437
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:06,500
that was something that we stole from

438
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,910
the US a lot of a lot of good ideas come

439
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:09,740
from there in the cybersecurity space

440
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:12,199
and they're miles ahead of us so we

441
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:13,760
we've actually used we've got it done

442
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:15,830
done a little bit differently we are

443
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,360
using Mis for the technology behind that

444
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,680
and those of you that have looked at the

445
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,990
program you'll notice that we've

446
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,750
actually got the guys from circle which

447
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:25,610
is the team that that writes the the

448
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,690
software behind Mis we've actually got

449
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,070
them here at the conference again

450
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,780
there's a couple of them here did some

451
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,760
tutorials in the last couple of days and

452
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:32,600
there's presentations today and tomorrow

453
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,069
from them as well

454
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,290
so we wanted to be able to get that

455
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:38,510
expertise out to you so that you can

456
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:40,610
learn from it but most importantly we're

457
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:42,860
actually going to for all of our members

458
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:45,140
we're going to launch the MIS Pervis so

459
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:47,870
that you can subscribe to it and you can

460
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:49,580
receive the giant flow of indicators of

461
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,770
compromise that that comes out of a

462
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:53,930
missed feed so over the next couple of

463
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:55,490
weeks we'll announce we do have to

464
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,949
charge you for that I said that we're

465
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,360
not for profit but it obviously there's

466
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,430
that there's an internal cost to us to

467
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,820
producing that information it's a very

468
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:08,120
highly focused curated high confidence

469
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:10,190
feed of information and that obviously

470
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,930
doesn't come for free so we'll announce

471
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:13,910
what the pricing is for that over the

472
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:16,069
next month or so and we're very very

473
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:19,610
excited about launching these three new

474
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:22,310
products so I'm going to stop talking

475
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,630
now and hand back to dr. David we're

476
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,430
going to go a little bit further through

477
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:28,180
the journey of people process technology

478
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:28,180
thank you everyone

479
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:34,560
thank you very much Mike is really

480
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,720
exciting I feel very M very lucky to be

481
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,699
director of assert but I'm quite

482
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,310
fortunate also to have to foot into in

483
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:42,750
or two feet in different camps also it

484
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,280
is part of the University of Queensland

485
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,330
but I also have a role within the

486
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,930
University Queensland

487
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:50,550
so the theme not going alone what is

488
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:51,900
also doing for you well we've covered

489
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:53,819
some of that there's some of that to

490
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:56,340
that stuff today with our pros to people

491
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,990
processes and technology but it's not

492
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:59,400
just about what University what else

493
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:00,810

very good morning to you it's an honor

501

to be here amongst all these

502
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:27,899
cybersecurity experts here I want to

503
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:31,250
find out how many of you are from the

504
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:36,120
industry can you raise your hands and

505
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:38,070
how many are from the government and how

506
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:43,830
many of you are currently not a wing and

507
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:48,090
need some coffee right now yeah I'm very

508
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:50,580
honored to actually be part of this UQ

509
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:53,610
cybersecurity program the whole goal of

510
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:55,679
this UQ cybersecurity program is that in

511
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:57,870
a few years time all of you who have

512
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:00,390
raised your hands are going to be part

513
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,429
of this UQ cyber security network why am

514
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:06,290
I saying that it's because one of the

515
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:09,780
problems is that we always have industry

516
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:12,480
academic research and education and

517
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:16,200
training in silos or in different parts

518
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,490
of the ecosystem and one of the

519
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,220
challenges is actually to bring them

520
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:21,630
together so as you can see from from

521
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,990
this perspective the University of

522
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:26,970
Queensland has invested in program which

523
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:31,520
actually brings everyone together author

524
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:34,160
and its members uqs IPS with its sock

525
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,090
the industry government and

526
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,870
international organizations like the

527
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:41,280
Interpol is owned East and so on

00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:43,510
together with all the researchers from

529
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:47,800
our different faculties the engineering

530
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:51,700
texture an IT faculty with the school of

531
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:55,060
IT EE the signs with the math and

532
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:56,650
physics you know the mathematicians and

533
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,500
the physicists who are working on a

534
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:02,620
quantum computing the post quantum

535
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:05,020
crypto and so on the humanities arts and

536
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:07,060
social science faculty who are working

537

on the different social aspects and the

538
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:11,860
challenges of cyber security and the

539
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:14,830
Business Economics and law faculty

540
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:17,620

economical decision-making the legal

542
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:22,419
aspects of cybersecurity medicine coming

543
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:26,800
together to understand from the

544
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:28,510
psychology perspective even for the

545
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,850
health information systems the data

546
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:33,370
privacy and so on the Center for Policy

547
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:36,850
futures covering the national security

548
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:38,830
and the policies and we have the

549
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:42,429
Institute for social science research

550
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:45,129
which supports the H a SS and also of

551
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:46,960
course yeah coming together and as Mike

552
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:50,320
alluded to it's dangerous to go alone

553
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,240
and David as well mention that so we all

554
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,189
coming together and together we've all

555
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,450
set we are actually offering a lot of

556
00:19:54,190 --> 00:19:58,870
continuing professional development

557
00:19:55,450 --> 00:20:01,870
courses the master's program PhDs and so

558
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:04,300

proposing to work together and it is my

560
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:11,379
dream at least to see all of you as part

561
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:13,919
of UQ cybersecurity if you come by our

562
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:17,080
booth you might get a UQ cybersecurity

563
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:20,160
sticker right so I'll see you at a booth

564
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,159
