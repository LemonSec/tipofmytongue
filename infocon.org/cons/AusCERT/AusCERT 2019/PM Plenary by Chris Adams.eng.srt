1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,119
our final presentation I gained from

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,380
another one of our platinum sponsors we

3
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,580
could not have also the way we do

4
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,379
without the support of our platinum

5
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:09,719
sponsors talking on threat intelligence

6
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:12,000
and automating security processes from

7
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,919
the good people at threat connect this

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,450
is Director of Sales Engineering at

9
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:21,948
threat connect Chris Adams give Chris a

10
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:21,948
round of applause all yours thank you

11
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:28,439
all right

12
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,970
intelligence the first time I really

13
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:34,260
thought about the challenges of

14
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:40,620
intelligence in a defensive perspective

15
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:42,540
is following 9/11 and when you think

16
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,180
about all the information that came out

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:46,980
following the attacks if you're like me

18
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,899
or all this information was coming in

19
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,449
and you felt like how could this not be

20
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:56,070
obvious right

21
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:59,940
that's the the benefit of hindsight but

22
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:01,469
if you really think about the the types

23
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,289
of things that were going on if we think

24
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:08,000
about the pilots for example okay their

25
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:10,970
pilots were being trained on US soil

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,920
both in California and in Florida

27
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:16,650
you had six of those pilots who were

28
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,790
frequently traveling between the United

29
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:23,189
States and Saudi Arabia frequently for

30
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,710
some number of those were involved in

31
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:29,639
the ham Hamburg cell in Germany so

32
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:33,259
there's obvious link there and actually

33
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,520
two of the pilots failed their training

34
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:37,350
training for Cessnas and even though

35
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,850
they had failed training they had asked

36
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:43,919
to train on Boeing large aircraft and so

37
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,850
in hindsight when all this comes out and

38
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,380
you think how could they not have

39
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,919
connected to the dots well you have to

40
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:54,149
think that there are over 15,000

41
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:57,030
trainings per year each all the systems

42
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,380
independent right there is no u1 giant

43
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,659
system where all that information might

44
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,130
be stored you have hundreds of thousands

45
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:05,340
of people traveling back and forth

46
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:07,079
between the US and in places in the

47
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,610
Middle East where they might be some

48
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:10,530
cells where they were doing some type of

49
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:12,200
activity right or communicating with

50
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,330
people who are orchestrating this

51
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:18,649
so that's a hard problem because these

52
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:21,110
are large disparate type systems some of

53
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:24,080
the some of the critique of the agencies

54
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:26,060
after the fact were you know criticisms

55
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,840
on what type of processes those Intel

56
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:31,069
agencies had we're their formal process

57
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,600
connecting all those things so in

58
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:35,030
hindsight you'd love to see that data

59
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,269
superimposed or it becomes clear but

60
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:42,580
there was no real process to do all that

61
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:45,620
and so threat Intel in the cyber realm I

62
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:48,350
as I like to think about things in that

63
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:49,970
grant perspective obviously it's a

64
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:52,250
different realm and cyber compared to

65
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:54,019
the traditional defense if we think

66
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,310
about what threat intelligence means in

67
00:02:54,019 --> 00:02:58,310
the cyber realm you can look at this

68
00:02:55,310 --> 00:03:05,110
definition by Gartner kind of wordy I'll

69
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:07,819
let you read that quick my summary

70
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,470
definition right is knowledge of threats

71
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:13,880
and capabilities right of infrastructure

72
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:15,880
motive intent right so if that's what

73
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:18,380
threat Intel is that's not an easy thing

74
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:19,940
right that isn't it's hard understand

75
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,049
that deep when you see the types of

76
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:22,579
things you're looking at day in and day

77
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:24,230
out how do you know what the real

78
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:25,340
motives are what are the capabilities

79
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:26,510
what are the infrastructures are using

80
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:29,299
it takes time to put this picture

81
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:31,970
together and so anyone who thinks about

82
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:33,709
threat Intel and everyone's at varying

83
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:38,540
levels of maturity and knowledge about

84
00:03:33,709 --> 00:03:40,489
it I like this this is a an idea that

85
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:44,390
you know everyone belongs somewhere on

86
00:03:40,489 --> 00:03:46,130
this plot right far left interested in

87
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:48,708
it don't really know how to engage and

88
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:49,940
begin to use trying to tell I won't read

89
00:03:48,709 --> 00:03:51,170
through all these things in detail for

90
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,000
the sake of time but you can kind of

91
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:56,149
think that you're beginning to start to

92
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
use it you might even begin to start

93
00:03:56,150 --> 00:04:00,440
creating it you might begin tying it

94
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,220
into things that you're seeing an

95
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:07,100
incidence or in in your sock you begin

96
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:09,049
to start automating some processes and

97
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:12,170
over time you've established a

98
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:14,180
methodology right for creating enriching

99
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,768
pulling that content in it so without

100
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,978
getting into too much detail to moving

101
00:04:15,769 --> 00:04:22,340
to that left side to the right there's

102
00:04:18,978 --> 00:04:24,950
I'll just talk about three key things

103
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,440
that most organizations can just think

104
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:32,330
about as in these are capabilities you

105
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:34,969
want to sort of bring online so to start

106
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:36,919
and I'll mention those being as we go

107
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:40,040
through here so to start aggregating

108
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:41,510
information aggregating phenol we gotta

109
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:43,639
be careful about words right it's we're

110
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:45,289
aggregating threat data potential this

111
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:47,180
is a lot of data you don't know if it's

112
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:49,550
intelligence yet intelligence comes

113
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:53,120
through a process right but one of the

114
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:54,650
key things is establishing you know a

115
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,000
repository where you're putting through

116
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,530
out into threat intelligence this is one

117
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,450
of the first practices and this sure

118
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,340
everybody in the room has some method

119
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:03,260
and I'll argue that even if it's an

120
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:06,109
Excel spreadsheet that's a start right

121
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:09,560
collecting information over time that

122
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:11,270
you believe I have some some some

123
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,130
knowledge that you want to share and

124
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,950
begin to sort of enrich and grow and

125
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:18,560
analyze and so the key to that is having

126
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:20,270
a data model and data model is going to

127
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,790
help you describe how where that data

128
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:24,889
comes and fits in and so those are

129
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:29,690
indicator types right IP addresses

130
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:32,180
addresses email addresses host URLs

131
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:34,880
now our events are some quite a bit

132
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,770
there but in the end you're the the goal

133
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,479
would be to have if you have multiple

134
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:39,950
sources of threaten to tell it could be

135
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,580
from government sources it could be Oh

136
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:46,250
sent phishing emails you have laying

137
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,690
around the team that you you realize you

138
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,820
have to aggregate and be able to start

139
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:54,080
pulling into the process if once you

140
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:55,789
once you begin to establish a data store

141
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,950
where you can pull that content in and

142
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:59,930
it's sort of represented here with you

143
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,000
know multiple sources when you have an

144
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:04,910
ability to deduplicate that information

145
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,979
normalize it find associations of cross

146
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:08,780
set this is when you begin to be able to

147
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:11,330
make sense out of all the into all the

148
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:15,440
information you might be pulling in okay

149
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:17,090
so I'd like to say that from my

150
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,979
experience in working in government you

151
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:21,020
want to establish a system of records

152
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:22,909
system of record and in traditional

153
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:25,460
sense means that you're building the

154
00:06:22,910 --> 00:06:28,250
authoritative source of threat Intel for

155
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:30,620
your organization a lot of government's

156
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:32,510
want to you know it's it's a it's a play

157
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:34,010
to try to become the system of record

158
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,310
and I think every organizations need

159
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:37,680
needs one

160
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,870
and that way when you have analysts come

161
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,550
and go from your team you retain all

162
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:46,830
that information and you have that to

163
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:49,730
work on as things go forward so that's a

164
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:53,419
bit about aggregating threat information

165
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:55,380
this second thing is analyze and

166
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:56,940
analyzing information can mean a lot of

167
00:06:55,380 --> 00:07:00,960
different things it's getting enrichment

168
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:04,110
from other sources it's being able to

169
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,460
sort of make sense out of what that what

170
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:08,820
type of data it is that you're looking

171
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:12,270
at and there are a few models that I

172
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:15,210
think should be embraced by teams to

173
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:16,590
drive that analysis work so some one of

174
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,659
the more plates straightforward

175
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:21,390
approaches is the diamond model for

176
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:24,090
intrusion analysis that's the idea that

177
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:25,890
anything involving a threat is some type

178
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:28,320
of activity you have a bad guy you have

179
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:29,990
a good guy that's being you know the

180
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,550
victim in the situation you have

181
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:35,190
infrastructure that's used to launch

182
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:36,930
some type of capability okay that's it's

183
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,310
a crime scene right there's always an

184
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:40,290
actor there's always some element of

185
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:42,600
that in that in that scenario if you

186
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:44,820
begin to think about things in that way

187
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,520
then you start forcing your mind when

188
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:49,080
you see pieces of information it begins

189
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,820
to make you want to think how do I want

190
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,700
to organize this data how do I want to

191
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:55,980
structure it how do I want to share it

192
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:58,469
with my team and then you get into a bit

193
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:01,230
bit more insert of the extent of you

194
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,640
know deeper models provided Lockheed

195
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:07,280
Martin and everybody probably knows the

196
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:10,020
kill chain miters more recently popular

197
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,840
attack all right these getting into much

198
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:14,159
more granular detail and we see a lot of

199
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:18,150
products coming online that begin to

200
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:21,630
support those they're all good to me a

201
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:23,789
team that establishes a methodology a

202
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:26,669
practice is really the key thing get the

203
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:28,500
team to speak in the same language right

204
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:30,419
when you're the that's really the key

205
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,890
part is building something establishing

206
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:34,348
something so that when new people come

207
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:36,120
on the team there is a methodology

208
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:39,510
approach that's a big key part about

209
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:42,020
discovery into turning threat data into

210
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:47,100
intelligence and it's establishes a

211
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:49,350
practiced practices for your team and

212
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:50,550
I'll just give a little

213
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:53,370
for people who aren't familiar with

214
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:55,709
attack it's quite complex but it's kind

215
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,990
of fun to look through here in fact

216
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:59,010
while Troy was talking I was trying to

217
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:01,620
think about where does some of these

218
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:03,270
things fit in on some of those but I

219
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:05,279
like to think about your you're looking

220
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,170
at you know the whys and then the house

221
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:10,260
if I want to establish some persistent

222
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:13,469
type of presence I'm a network I want to

223
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:14,640
create an account right if I can get the

224
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,529
crown and then I want to escalate my

225
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,449
privileges I might use some passed the

226
00:09:16,529 --> 00:09:21,270
hash technique and start moving around

227
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:23,399
somebody's infrastructure right so

228
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:25,770
there's always sort of a mindset now

229
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:28,140
when you begin to pull information in

230
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,520
and learn more about what you're saying

231
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:32,370
if you begin to start thinking where do

232
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,689
i classifies that by this it's a lot

233
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:35,220
better than just having a lot of data in

234
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:41,640
a spreadsheet that says oh I should be

235
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:43,020
concerned about these things and and so

236
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:46,550
that's a little bit about aggregating

237
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:48,439
content a little bit about analyzing

238
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,979
until you begin to start

239
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,100
operationalizing and that's a loaded

240
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:55,140
word I'm familiar but we can think we

241
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,339
want to begin to start moving that

242
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:58,319
intelligence around in our

243
00:09:56,339 --> 00:10:00,450
infrastructure because until I could I

244
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,980
can have six billion indicators with

245
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:05,070
someone telling me that's all bad it

246
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:07,529
really doesn't mean anything until I

247
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:11,250
find out that there's an indicator in

248
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:14,700
some feet that matches data that I have

249
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:16,680
in my logs right so that's all the

250
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,300
sudden your eyes are widened and you

251
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,120
think I got to do something right

252
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:23,969
because you've you now have some proof

253
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,940
that that resides in your network and so

254
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:28,620
I believe you no threat Intel is becomes

255
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:30,360
that lifeblood that flows through the

256
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,150
environment where it's really a feedback

257
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:34,920
loop between your infrastructure and

258
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:37,230
what it is you've learned and what it is

259
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,790
you've pulled in and that's not just

260
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:41,100
from a system perspective I mean it's

261
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:42,360
sometimes the fun part the integrations

262
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:44,640
and seeing how you can pull things and

263
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,270
get products to work together but it's

264
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,079
also people

265
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:51,029
it's people from I are seeing something

266
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:53,640
sharing that collaborating within an

267
00:10:51,029 --> 00:10:55,560
environment becomes a very important

268
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:59,180
part of that what we call dissemination

269
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,180
within our in within the organization

270
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:08,399
and so I'm gonna when you begin to start

271
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:11,110
you know systems can permit that type of

272
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:15,190
integrations right just from I'd say

273
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:18,339
some from central store the api's you

274
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:21,190
have this a new word that's making its

275
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:23,350
way sore right there's a security

276
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:26,170
orchestration being able to automate

277
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:27,850
some type of response to that there's a

278
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:31,719
pretty graphic from Gartner making this

279
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:34,060
official technology and you have really

280
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:37,230
a kind of a healthy cycle here of detect

281
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:39,430
triage responded responded prioritize

282
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:40,300
there's some value in this and I

283
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:42,609
thinking this is like a traditional

284
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:44,199
really cycle for analysis right in

285
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,199
things you want to do and being able to

286
00:11:44,199 --> 00:11:49,300
orchestrate processes I'm an IT guy I

287
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:51,699
love tech right but I don't believe you

288
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:54,189
can just automate your way out of out of

289
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:55,990
problems I think what you do is find

290
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,060
ways to optimize what the team is doing

291
00:11:55,990 --> 00:12:00,459
I'll show some examples of this in a

292
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:03,369
minute but orchestration is really just

293
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:05,649
the concept that a team you know

294
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:07,600
security is maturing right there should

295
00:12:05,649 --> 00:12:09,610
be established processes some of that of

296
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,310
which you can automate some that you're

297
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:14,079
not you don't need to we're not trying

298
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:17,050
to turn security into something that's

299
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:19,269
you know built just be self-healing

300
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:21,699
there are a reason for analysts what's

301
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:24,069
or does promise and the automation the

302
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:26,229
part of things is to give your analyst

303
00:12:24,069 --> 00:12:28,810
more time to really focus on the

304
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:30,670
analysis part and relieve some time from

305
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:35,199
the things of the the things that can be

306
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:38,170
automated and so I'd like to thank you

307
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,399
know as a tech person right this isn't I

308
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:41,769
say down to the bottom right this is

309
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:44,860
nothing new it's not new in the sense

310
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:48,970
that in IT in general there's been

311
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:52,120
automation forever right people are old

312
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:53,980
as I back in the you know days when

313
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,290
Enterprise Service buses were the rage

314
00:12:53,980 --> 00:13:00,009
and for the IT stack right Message

315
00:12:56,290 --> 00:13:02,110
Queuing Web Services these are

316
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:05,019
technologies that will lets if we call

317
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:09,180
security a department in an organization

318
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:11,230
like finite like finance logistics

319
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:13,870
operations all the different departments

320
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:15,549
you have they have grown up stacks of

321
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:17,679
products

322
00:13:15,549 --> 00:13:20,079
security is just seems to be this like

323
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:22,299
let the the last to become an official

324
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,910
department that deserves technologies

325
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:27,429
the tie systems together many times

326
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:30,069
security stacks you know they're grown

327
00:13:27,429 --> 00:13:32,199
organically no one no one typically

328
00:13:30,069 --> 00:13:34,238
people don't define an enterprise

329
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:36,729
architecture and then start filling

330
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:40,089
things in right departments they get a

331
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:41,739
firewall they get an IDs proxy wait

332
00:13:40,089 --> 00:13:43,239
everyone knows how things go with retic

333
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:44,709
and then the fight is how do you get

334
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:48,549
these things to talk to each other and

335
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:51,189
so sore is that realization that it's

336
00:13:48,549 --> 00:13:52,779
maturities cut that you know security is

337
00:13:51,189 --> 00:13:55,389
now becoming a first-class citizen

338
00:13:52,779 --> 00:13:57,069
that's in the end it is just data right

339
00:13:55,389 --> 00:14:00,160
and having an approach to managing that

340
00:13:57,069 --> 00:14:04,029
data is what we're looking for so let's

341
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,529
just look at a couple examples of what I

342
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:08,980
think are some of the key examples for

343
00:14:05,529 --> 00:14:11,949
people just to think about from a

344
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:16,389
malware analysis perspective in this

345
00:14:11,949 --> 00:14:18,099
case take malware file be loaded into

346
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:21,579
your tip there's some context of where

347
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:24,129
it came from files then sent to an AMA

348
00:14:21,579 --> 00:14:27,279
tool you parse the results of that and

349
00:14:24,129 --> 00:14:28,540
then maybe present some of that

350
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,629
information you came back from that

351
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:33,399
report so in that case perhaps some iOS

352
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:35,410
C's that came out of what that malware

353
00:14:33,399 --> 00:14:37,660
did are collected they're pulled back

354
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:40,629
into your tip perhaps speeds that you

355
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:42,999
that you have pulled into your into a

356
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:44,199
central store now gives some context of

357
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:46,749
what that is and if you could then

358
00:14:44,199 --> 00:14:48,219
search a sim or search something and you

359
00:14:46,749 --> 00:14:50,589
can see if that had some effect on you

360
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:52,299
so this is something maybe you know a

361
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:53,949
lot of analysts will do every day if you

362
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:55,779
can automate that so that you're just

363
00:14:53,949 --> 00:14:57,669
seeing the results of anything you sent

364
00:14:55,779 --> 00:15:00,339
that you're saving a lot of time and

365
00:14:57,669 --> 00:15:01,869
value ever over a period of time for a

366
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:04,119
little bit more sophisticated type of

367
00:15:01,869 --> 00:15:05,889
example this is something we had built

368
00:15:04,119 --> 00:15:08,919
just a designer from a customer's

369
00:15:05,889 --> 00:15:10,629
perspective is what if I take you fish

370
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:12,999
right buddy huh get something how many

371
00:15:10,629 --> 00:15:15,459
phishing emails do people get inundated

372
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:18,489
with every week if I can automate a

373
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:20,549
process where I'm sending every fish to

374
00:15:18,489 --> 00:15:24,369
an environment we're parsing taking off

375
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:25,959
header body attachments we're running

376
00:15:24,369 --> 00:15:27,310
all those through enrichment sources in

377
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:29,079
this case

378
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:32,290
we're looking you know taking something

379
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:35,860
it's detonating malware in a malware

380
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:38,079
analysis platform taking that

381
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:40,180
information back and it like I'd

382
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:43,240
mentioned earlier a few parts and then

383
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:45,339
can search your sim and find out have

384
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,410
any of those indicators a bit in my

385
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:51,790
environment well maybe then my result is

386
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:55,750
I create a ticket or maybe I lock the ad

387
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:57,160
account of that user just to prevent

388
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:59,650
them and say send them a note slack

389
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:01,329
message that they have to talk to IT

390
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:04,030
before they can log into their account

391
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:07,000
again alright so a little bit

392
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:09,339
sophisticated use case the key is that

393
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,660
this is all possible these are things

394
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:13,210
that you can do you can modify those

395
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:14,980
flows to your heart's content you can

396
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:16,570
introduce a person in the loop and say

397
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,680
before I take this step I actually want

398
00:16:16,570 --> 00:16:19,450
to be able to make a decision here I

399
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:22,030
don't want something to follow all

400
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:23,620
through this right and so the key thing

401
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:26,140
to take away with this is that with the

402
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:28,150
advent of automation in this sense it's

403
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:30,130
and I consider this where we were talked

404
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:32,860
about that maturity curve kind of here

405
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:35,110
that at far right where we're trying to

406
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:38,230
identify the things that art seem to

407
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:40,390
waste a lot of our time and I think I've

408
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:42,340
seen in terms of benefiting one man

409
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:44,380
teams or one person teams who are

410
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:46,120
running security up to having teams of

411
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:47,740
60 people there's always a means for

412
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,870
being able automate and that's part of

413
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:53,740
what I understand to be very beneficial

414
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:56,410
for organizations it's so cost but I

415
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,750
have to just mention this real quick

416
00:16:56,410 --> 00:17:01,420
part of what you want to try to achieve

417
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:03,520
internet like return on investment right

418
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:06,310
what is all what does automation offer

419
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:09,879
well you can calculate the amount of

420
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:12,280
time it takes to do certain things if

421
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:14,890
you put a dollar a you know monetary

422
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,930
value on the amount of time it takes and

423
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:18,459
be able to show that return this ends up

424
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:20,920
becoming a very positive way to be able

425
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:22,390
to show back to your leadership look how

426
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,709
much time we're saving if we enter and

427
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:27,069
this is exactly what you've seen a lot

428
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:31,080
of different products today even outside

429
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:31,080
of security when automation is involved

430
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,310
all right that's all I had

431
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,170
we're here in the booth anything that I

432
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:42,629
said feel like I want to discuss more

433
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:42,630
happy to chat about it and thank you

434
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:50,289
thank you very much Chris and thank you

435
00:17:48,279 --> 00:17:55,350
for threat connects wonderful support of

436
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:55,350
officer 29a that's us done for to die
