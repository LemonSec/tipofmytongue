00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:15,179
can I please kindly remind everyone to

7
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:18,080
either switch off your phone or put it

8
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:21,029
on silent speakers spend a lot of time

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:22,740
you know putting over all their slides

10
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,019
together and whatnot and rehearsing so

11
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:29,159
sometimes it can throw them off not can

12
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:30,839
those seasoned professional and we will

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,750
have some some time at the end hopefully

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,600
if there are any questions if we do go

15
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,710
over then um you know just grab them in

16
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,980
a hallway or something like that and ask

17
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,750
him a few questions there right yeah so

18
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:46,379
kick it off all that cane introduce

19
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,519
himself but I'm glad to be introducing

20
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:52,110
cane because it's a good friend of mine

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:59,100
we would go way back so everyone round

22
00:00:52,110 --> 00:01:01,079
of applause I cannot thank you I'm glad

23
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,690
you actually reminded me there I almost

24
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,369
left my phone on on loud ring that could

25
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,310
have been wheedling the presenter has

26
00:01:05,369 --> 00:01:10,380
that happened but so it a couple more

27
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,869
coming in but yeah hello everyone my

28
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,420
name is Ken Norton if you've been to us

29
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:16,380
at before you've probably seen me before

30
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,670
every time I try and get out they

31
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:20,729
something else that have pulled me back

32
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:23,159
into speak one more time I am filling a

33
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:26,039
slot for my colleague Chris Horsley who

34
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,110
couldn't make it that uh you know like

35
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,490
when you run into someone you haven't

36
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:32,310
seen for a while and you're like ah

37
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,990
how's that car you're rebuilding or

38
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,970
something and then for the next like two

39
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,170
hours they just like oh I got this thing

40
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:38,759
do this thing in this thing that's

41
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,200
pretty much what I'm like we saw at the

42
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,630
moment like I've been living and

43
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,220
breathing this and thinking about it for

44
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:45,780
like the last two or three months so

45
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,429
it's probably good that I got this

46
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:49,829
presentation slot to sort of like get

47
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:52,140
all my thoughts out there because yeah

48
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:56,610
it's a really interesting area and

49
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:59,729
probably the only thing insecurity that

50
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:03,060
I think everyone should do every company

51
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:04,979
that has at least one security person if

52
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,819
you're not looking at automation and

53
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:11,690
orchestration you're probably flirting

54
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,690
yourselves down

55
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:16,390
terms of who we are why you should

56
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:17,019
listen to me and all of that sort of

57
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:21,010
stuff

58
00:02:17,019 --> 00:02:23,439
we're kosis we are a consultancy largely

59
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:27,370
based out of Melbourne but also New

60
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:29,590
Zealand and Tasmania we do we started

61
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,549
out doing threat Intel Soph Youth so he

62
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:34,000
probably said we talk about threat Intel

63
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:38,290
we've since moved more in towards doing

64
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,569
consultancy around Sox we do a lot of

65
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:42,400
bespoke software development we've been

66
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:44,339
doing some work in the traditional

67
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,650
intelligence space recently working with

68
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:48,609
Oz track and the Crime Commission

69
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:51,930
looking at how they can get better

70
00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:56,170
feedback on there are like old-school

71
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:59,019
Intel not cyber Intel but yeah we do a

72
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,429
lot of development for our customers

73
00:02:59,019 --> 00:03:03,010
where they have security tools that

74
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,500
don't quite play nice together and

75
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:09,989
that's really what's or comes down to in

76
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:12,340
many ways I should give this little

77
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:13,870
inter about yeah we have in terms of

78
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:15,010
biases and conflicts of interest I think

79
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,750
this stuff's important when you're

80
00:03:15,010 --> 00:03:18,280
talking about a general field like we

81
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,889
sort of have a horse in this race I

82
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,859
guess we we started working with phantom

83
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:25,930
like really early on in phantom before

84
00:03:23,859 --> 00:03:28,900
they are acquired by Splunk and we also

85
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:33,010
extend support whatever with open source

86
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:35,049
including Stax dawn but like we started

87
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,730
having those commercial relationships

88
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:38,859
because of what we thought was cool not

89
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:40,358
necessarily you know he had a commercial

90
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:42,760
relationship and starts breaking it but

91
00:03:40,359 --> 00:03:44,440
you know I guess you need to view

92
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,030
whatever I say through the lens of the

93
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:49,989
fact that I do have some sort of

94
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:52,329
inherent commercial bias in terms of

95
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:55,659
what we've done in the orchestration

96
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:59,169
play star I've written integrations for

97
00:03:55,659 --> 00:04:01,000
swimlane santan stack storm and walk off

98
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:03,940
and in terms of traditional

99
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,849
orchestration I've written in terms of

100
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:09,159
client stuff in puppet ansible

101
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:11,768
knife I which is a bit sort of different

102
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:14,010
little bit of Chef cfengine back in the

103
00:04:11,769 --> 00:04:16,209
day and Luigi so I've sort of

104
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,159
orchestrated through most of the

105
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:20,079
orchestration engines now so I've got a

106
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:22,510
pretty reasonable view on how they all

107
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,830
fit together and sort of what it's all

108
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,360
about

109
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:26,830
a lot of this stuff you

110
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,970
sort of find a really sharp edges till

111
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,258
you've been using it for a while so I

112
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,789
think I've got a bit of a feel for it

113
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:32,289
and I started writing my own engine a

114
00:04:30,789 --> 00:04:35,919
while ago too and then realized that was

115
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:38,020
really hard working stopped but yeah so

116
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,930
in terms of what it is like for you most

117
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:43,628
likely now unless you have reached you

118
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:45,729
know the next stage so the machine goes

119
00:04:43,629 --> 00:04:46,990
ding you probably have a lot of machines

120
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:48,340
there's a lot of people in the hall out

121
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:51,099
there that will sell you new machines

122
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:51,729
with nice blinky lights they'll cost you

123
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:52,840
yeah

124
00:04:51,729 --> 00:04:54,669
one hundred and something thousand

125
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,219
dollars each you plug them in and iraq

126
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:59,020
and they generate alerts assuming that

127
00:04:57,219 --> 00:05:01,090
you plug them in correctly and you know

128
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,859
that's cool and all but i'd almost

129
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:04,539
guarantee you in each of you buy one you

130
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,400
blinky light box you don't get one new

131
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:08,139
staff member to help me support said

132
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,340
blinky lights and alerts to come out of

133
00:05:08,139 --> 00:05:13,870
it so as your bosses and even

134
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,210
potentially yourselves buy more and more

135
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:18,009
and more things you've got more and more

136
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,690
and more alerts but you're expected to

137
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:21,879
try and find efficiencies in order to

138
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:24,310
deal with them and that is unfortunately

139
00:05:21,879 --> 00:05:25,870
for most organizations not all that easy

140
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,879
you get to a point right where there's

141
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:32,580
only so much blood you can get out of a

142
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:36,430
stone so yeah a machine will go ding a

143
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:39,550
human will look at what the alert is all

144
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:40,659
about a human will then probably have to

145
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:42,339
log into three different systems

146
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:44,889
together the context about what this

147
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:47,440
alert actually means also you know a

148
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:48,969
user had malware well who's the user

149
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,949
what groups are they in what permissions

150
00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:52,330
do they have what's the malware what did

151
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:53,770
the malware end up doing how did the

152
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:56,979
malware get there all this stuff and

153
00:05:53,770 --> 00:06:01,210
then a human goes and responds if you

154
00:05:56,979 --> 00:06:02,440
are fortunate and please don't take it

155
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:04,900
as a given this is the case you are

156
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,550
working out of a incident response or a

157
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,679
ticketing system a lot of people use

158
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:11,620
like RT which is old as the hills

159
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,729
JIRA maybe you've got ServiceNow or

160
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:15,430
something that's a bit more sort of

161
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:16,539
intended towards this but there's also a

162
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:19,240
lot of teams there who work out of

163
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:20,889
inboxes so it's really whether you or

164
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,089
your colleague opened the email first

165
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:23,469
and whether you move it to the folder

166
00:06:22,089 --> 00:06:24,460
whether you double handle something and

167
00:06:23,469 --> 00:06:26,889
you're probably not getting a lot of

168
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:29,979
statistics about what you did this is

169
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:32,409
what most people look like now I've

170
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:34,240
noticed a lot of organizations I talk to

171
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:35,560
think that it's just them I think it's

172
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,969
like their little sort of secret they're

173
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,529
ashamed of that they work this way and

174
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:39,759
everyone else must be doing all this

175
00:06:38,529 --> 00:06:41,829
some stuff because they see all sorts of

176
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,149
cool presentations about amazing new

177
00:06:41,829 --> 00:06:48,219
technologies but it's almost everyone

178
00:06:45,149 --> 00:06:50,889
the major banks have been doing this a

179
00:06:48,219 --> 00:06:54,699
long time and they're pretty decent but

180
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:56,409
you know you'll still have this very few

181
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:58,149
organizations acquires regimented as

182
00:06:56,409 --> 00:07:00,279
they sort of think they should be and

183
00:06:58,149 --> 00:07:02,919
would like to be in terms of Navarra

184
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:06,939
from my perspective the machine goes

185
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:08,799
ding then the machine goes and looks as

186
00:07:06,939 --> 00:07:10,029
to what the ding is all about the

187
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:13,029
machine logs in all the different

188
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:15,489
systems gets all the context throw them

189
00:07:13,029 --> 00:07:17,469
back to a human the human looks at all

190
00:07:15,489 --> 00:07:19,239
of context uses that our own judgment

191
00:07:17,469 --> 00:07:20,919
which we still don't know how to give

192
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:22,299
judgment to computers is always going to

193
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:23,889
be exceptions or things that make ego

194
00:07:22,299 --> 00:07:26,169
that right

195
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:26,949
human can give a response you go yep go

196
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:28,659
and do the thing that you're

197
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:30,189
recommending or that the process says

198
00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:31,808
and then the Machine goes and actually

199
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:34,689
does it and you've got an audit log you

200
00:07:31,809 --> 00:07:36,969
can see exactly what happened when it

201
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:39,999
happened so yeah it does a why

202
00:07:36,969 --> 00:07:41,379
orchestrate like not every tool that you

203
00:07:39,999 --> 00:07:44,289
have out there can currently talk to

204
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:45,639
every tool having a specialized like

205
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:46,779
middle person in the middle that knows

206
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,419
how to talk to everything makes sense

207
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:51,159
instead of like every single thing that

208
00:07:49,419 --> 00:07:53,198
you use knowing how to talk to Jared a

209
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:54,969
logic ticket like that sucks and then

210
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,289
maybe they change the IP API slightly

211
00:07:54,969 --> 00:07:57,459
and everything has to change you're

212
00:07:56,289 --> 00:07:58,628
better off having like one sort of

213
00:07:57,459 --> 00:08:01,539
octopus in the middle that touches

214
00:07:58,629 --> 00:08:03,369
everything consistency of process if you

215
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:05,259
have automated or orchestrated a process

216
00:08:03,369 --> 00:08:07,119
it's done the same every time you know

217
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:08,709
exactly how long everything took you

218
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:11,229
don't have the ability for different

219
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:14,709
analysts to apply their own unique take

220
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:17,349
on well you know maybe maybe Bob goes

221
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:20,109
and uses one particular site to look at

222
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:21,729
Whois data whereas you know Glen dough

223
00:08:20,109 --> 00:08:23,109
uses this different site and maybe

224
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:24,248
they've different responses maybe one's

225
00:08:23,109 --> 00:08:25,929
better than the other but they have

226
00:08:24,249 --> 00:08:27,879
their personal preference when you start

227
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:29,558
orchestrating and automating it's

228
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,539
consistent and if you do want to change

229
00:08:29,559 --> 00:08:32,379
you change the process you don't just

230
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:33,938
have different people on different

231
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:36,129
shifts doing things in different ways of

232
00:08:33,938 --> 00:08:37,958
different outcomes

233
00:08:36,129 --> 00:08:40,539
having approval change is really good

234
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:44,008
maybe if you want to put something I've

235
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:48,730
had people who work for me in a sock who

236
00:08:44,009 --> 00:08:50,949
misread and alert the alert was the

237
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:51,750
sorry the the advice was very unclear

238
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:53,699
but they if

239
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:55,770
we block the IP addresses belonging to

240
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,660
LinkedIn rather than the impersonator

241
00:08:55,770 --> 00:09:00,060
addresses because all the contacts was

242
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,680
jumbled together easy to do however if

243
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:04,079
you're running orchestration then you

244
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:05,790
can go and you can have two stage

245
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,590
approval process if you want to block

246
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,780
something on your corporate proxies you

247
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:11,400
probably need a tt3 or a management

248
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,990
person to look at it and go yeah I agree

249
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,090
with that if it's mitigating malware on

250
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:18,390
a box you know level one level two can

251
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:20,940
do it it's easy it is faster and cheaper

252
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:22,620
I think to document something for a

253
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,360
computer to repeat a process than it is

254
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,070
to write a giant word document that

255
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,200
describes the process exactly for a

256
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:29,460
human and all of the courses of changes

257
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,260
around it and when you change the

258
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,540
instructions for a computer it amazed

259
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:35,370
them if you have people in your

260
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,900
organization who open the instruction

261
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,510
document every time they perform a task

262
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:41,130
and read it point by point good job you

263
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:43,680
but there's very few of them out there

264
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:47,550
most people will very quite quickly from

265
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:50,250
the written standard yeah and also when

266
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:52,920
you add an extra bit of context an extra

267
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:56,339
step an extra check an extra whatever to

268
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:57,240
a orchestration playbook it's there

269
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,830
you've done the work

270
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,810
it might take slightly longer to run if

271
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:03,120
you have your people in your team and

272
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:05,099
you expect them to do seven things and

273
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,510
you add another two and it's nine you

274
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,710
know all of a sudden they've got 15%

275
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,450
more things to do every day that's

276
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:13,050
pretty rough computers don't care

277
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:14,550
computers luckily do it there's a bit of

278
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,160
a difference in terms of terminology for

279
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:19,949
orchestration and automation I maybe

280
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:21,780
sort of bleed between two a little in

281
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:24,330
this talk but automation is when you

282
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:26,730
take a thing that you do and you teach a

283
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:28,710
computer how to do it like a robot

284
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:31,320
playing guitar if you want to you know

285
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:32,790
get that stairway to heaven solo you can

286
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,490
teach a robot how to do that that is

287
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:38,520
automated at that point however if you

288
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:40,170
are orchestrating it is usually looking

289
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,699
at multiple systems at the same time and

290
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:45,810
making them work nicely together you

291
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:47,550
know like an orchestra you will find

292
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:48,989
that most organizations have a

293
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:50,520
reasonable amount of automation

294
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,930
somewhere at this point automation

295
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,160
tooling but it's having all those

296
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:57,410
individual things work together the

297
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:59,939
stuff um there's a reason like I think

298
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:01,829
orchestration is like it's obviously the

299
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,260
right thing to do but I think one of the

300
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,630
main reasons people aren't doing it or

301
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,520
haven't

302
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:09,150
chief tit is if you sort of go back to

303
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:12,250
actual like musical orchestration like

304
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:15,220
handsomer sits down at a piano like

305
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:17,260
writing a song is pretty hard like you

306
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:19,060
need a melody you need a rhythm all of

307
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:20,620
this stuff takes a lot of effort to sort

308
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,270
of put together it's quite challenging

309
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,580
it's tough man this is like just a piano

310
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:25,750
how am I going to like manage this but

311
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,160
then you can sort of take the piano you

312
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,840
pretty much divided it into sections in

313
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,490
each of those bits goes off and I you

314
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:32,680
know the violin sort of played this bit

315
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:34,870
over here and you know the guy on the

316
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,339
cello dislike plays the bass notes so

317
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,570
you know it's really like the difference

318
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:39,310
between playing something on a piano and

319
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:40,990
having four people play it in terms of

320
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,670
writing the music it's pretty small and

321
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:44,530
then when you start going to like a

322
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:45,969
Chamber Orchestra we've just got more of

323
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:47,230
each instrument like the hard bit you're

324
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:49,570
sitting down at the piano and writing

325
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:51,190
the song after that you leverage all of

326
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,480
the knowledge and the systems you put

327
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,040
together to sort of expand it out and

328
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,180
the next thing ya like difference

329
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,170
between writing for a chamber orchestra

330
00:11:55,180 --> 00:12:00,670
and you know a full orchestra and it's

331
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:02,740
not that much even though it's 200

332
00:12:00,670 --> 00:12:04,870
people instead of say 20 like it's more

333
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,280
of the same instruments so the hardest

334
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,200
bit you will ever do when it comes to

335
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,520
orchestration is like writing the first

336
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,480
couple of play books and then from that

337
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:14,260
point you build on it and it snowballs

338
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,020
in terms of the difference between

339
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:19,030
traditional sorry yeah I think saw I

340
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:21,270
kept using that word probably ain't

341
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:24,010
Gartner hatched the term security

342
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:25,300
orchestration and automation and a

343
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:27,939
response

344
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,829
yeah security orchestration they call it

345
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:32,340
saw and somehow it's stuck in my mind at

346
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:34,240
this point the difference between saw

347
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:36,400
like security orchestration and

348
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,900
infrastructure orchestration security

349
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,790
tends to be more event-driven and just

350
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:41,230
generally deal with more events than you

351
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,550
know like disc Falls and stuff don't

352
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:44,170
happen all the time in most people's

353
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,310
fleets whereas security events or

354
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,469
security warnings are a little more

355
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:49,089
common there's more different things to

356
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:50,860
talk to usually if you're standing up

357
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:53,050
infrastructure on AWS there's not that

358
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,610
many you know bits and pieces that you

359
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,620
need to plug into security is probably

360
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:58,150
touching everything there's more zones

361
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:59,560
of control I'll talk about that in a

362
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:01,900
moment and there's more externalities

363
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,880
you're probably going outside for

364
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,350
context more often inside your own or if

365
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,720
you're standing up a system inside your

366
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:09,460
organization then you're probably really

367
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,570
just like looking at your configuration

368
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,860
database you're looking at the

369
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,300
instructions for the Box what its name

370
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:15,510
should be or whatever if you're doing

371
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,839
security response you're going I will

372
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,830
this IP address in Panama

373
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,600
how long's that had that domain name

374
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:21,830
what other things are over here it's a

375
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,170
bit there's a lot more external stuff

376
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:25,100
you need to care about even though the

377
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,439
systems are different they are also

378
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,700
quite complementary and I wouldn't stand

379
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,800
up a box using your security

380
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:32,390
orchestration stuff or possibly even

381
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,829
reformat it maybe you can rely on your

382
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:37,670
existing orchestration inside your

383
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:39,470
organization to do that one thing that I

384
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:42,319
don't see so much in traditional

385
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:45,110
orchestration is the ability to like

386
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:47,540
debounce an alert if you have a warning

387
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:49,070
about a about blah blah blah calm five

388
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,810
times coming through different systems

389
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:52,760
you sort of want to go I'm already

390
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:54,589
handling that like I don't want to run

391
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:57,020
the same workflow five times for the

392
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:58,850
same thing within 10 seconds that is

393
00:13:57,020 --> 00:14:03,260
something that a lot of the traditional

394
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:05,600
tooling doesn't support that well hand

395
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:08,360
off points unless you work in a very

396
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,370
small organization or one that has had a

397
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,990
major security incident and everyone

398
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:14,570
sort of thinks that security is super

399
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:16,100
important you will have a zone of

400
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:18,080
responsibility in the zone of control

401
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:21,530
and other people have their own your IT

402
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:23,270
people as a former sysadmin I can

403
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:24,740
totally appreciate this you know they

404
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:26,569
have their own stuff they're like this

405
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:30,230
is mine and that's yours get back on

406
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:33,830
your side of the fence you unfortunately

407
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:37,130
need to work with that you if you want

408
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:38,750
to have a desktop reimaged you probably

409
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:40,040
don't want to have your security tooling

410
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:42,680
going and doing that out from underneath

411
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,660
your IT outsourcing that said there is

412
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:47,510
also possibly if you're paying per

413
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:49,339
ticket to an IT outsourcer you can

414
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:52,700
possibly make a really good use case for

415
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:54,380
saw by if you pay you know forty dollars

416
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,700
a ticket you create thirty dollars it's

417
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:58,340
even twenty dollars a ticket that you

418
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,450
create for your IT outsourcer if you can

419
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,620
add up how many of those you can

420
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:02,780
automate so they never go to the

421
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,310
outsourcer then like that's how much

422
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:05,360
money you can ask for for your budget

423
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:07,489
and it's like well I'm not costing you

424
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,930
anything you know I'm saving you 15

425
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,150
grand and I want to use 15 grand with

426
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:12,290
the time to do this let's do it it's

427
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,910
certainly an option but you look be

428
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:15,230
careful of handoff points and don't try

429
00:15:13,910 --> 00:15:17,209
and ride roughshod over your IT people

430
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:19,550
because that will usually go very poorly

431
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:24,680
for you or them or basically your

432
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:26,479
relationship there's a lot of options I

433
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,680
realized when looking at some of the

434
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:29,870
licensing stuff that some of this is a

435
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,040
little bit more fuzzy than I thought so

436
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:33,920
terms of open store

437
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,620
Saxton we ran stack storm training on

438
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,060
Tuesday which yeah there's some thumbs

439
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:40,580
up on the sack storm training so that's

440
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:41,959
good it it's always difficult doing

441
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,070
technical training for a large group of

442
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,780
people but I think it went pretty well

443
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:47,840
so stack storm is out there it's been

444
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:49,130
used a lot it is extreme networks who

445
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,590
are somewhere out here who do a lot of

446
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:53,540
like traditional networking stuff ended

447
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:55,190
up owning stack Storm and appear to be

448
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:56,750
good custodians of it so that's nice I

449
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:59,960
was looking at an open source project

450
00:15:56,750 --> 00:16:02,690
who's like who's paying for it is that

451
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,270
just like a passionate individual who is

452
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,200
doing it on their own time because

453
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:08,090
passionate individuals burnout

454
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,130
passionate individuals is no way to

455
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:13,190
write software that you know a bunch of

456
00:16:10,130 --> 00:16:14,930
really large companies rely on it to do

457
00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:16,670
what they do there needs to be some sort

458
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:19,160
of model that lets people spend time on

459
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:20,930
it I think so yes stack storm is

460
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,250
something that we use a fair bit and

461
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,910
recommend it's got a good engine it's

462
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:26,000
got good bones

463
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:27,790
I'd say the logo below that the bird

464
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,130
King is NSA's walk-offs

465
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:33,110
I don't know for sure but walk off

466
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:35,030
certainly feels like a skunkworks sort

467
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:37,160
of proof of concept thing I would

468
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:39,560
imagine the NSA doesn't use it a really

469
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,150
large scale if you compare it to some of

470
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:45,290
the other projects of open source like

471
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:47,390
um geared uh I can't say or um

472
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:49,520
knife I those look like really

473
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:51,470
engineered projects and walk off not so

474
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,670
much but they're architecting some of

475
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,740
the backend stuff so it could be alright

476
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:55,819
but once again those two free stacks

477
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,310
storm has a good thing where you can pay

478
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:01,190
for it to get like a drag-and-drop

479
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:03,439
ething to join your actions together in

480
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:06,320
terms of close and commercial phantom so

481
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,660
well Denise toe who are now a Palo Alto

482
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:12,980
company and swimlane are sort of the

483
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:15,320
main options commercially foresaw they

484
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:16,610
all sort of have a similar approach with

485
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:20,240
different features and so on and

486
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:21,829
different integrations one thing that I

487
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,449
would like I'd almost sort of moved to

488
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:25,280
misto to the middle somewhere even

489
00:17:23,449 --> 00:17:27,560
though their engine and everything is

490
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,240
closed source and commercial all of the

491
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,040
integrations play books and everything

492
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,920
that they publish is under an MIT

493
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:36,139
license they also publish a standard for

494
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,480
their play books so if you wanted to

495
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:39,920
take all of the hard work that the

496
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,330
mister and their partners have done in

497
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,460
terms of integration and coming up with

498
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:44,178
examples you could sort of cross port

499
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,740
them into one of the

500
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:47,029
other engines and I'll talk a little bit

501
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:48,320
about that later but it would be an

502
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:50,299
option it would be legal it's MIT

503
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:54,740
license which means you do it how you

504
00:17:50,299 --> 00:17:56,330
want what you want even commercially I'm

505
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:59,149
not a lawyer but yeah that's the short

506
00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:01,939
version a lot of other platforms have

507
00:17:59,149 --> 00:18:03,619
saw as a feature service now Splunk

508
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,779
itself can like do things when alerts

509
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:07,908
happen threat Connect has it they're out

510
00:18:05,779 --> 00:18:10,549
here alienvault but probably around I

511
00:18:07,909 --> 00:18:13,460
guess logarithm almost everyone who has

512
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:16,820
a seam or a threat Intel thing has some

513
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:18,889
degree of orchestration or automation

514
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:20,360
because when you're generating alerts

515
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:22,340
you want to do something with them so

516
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:24,168
it's pretty obvious but these guys and

517
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,490
like this is my own personal view they

518
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:28,190
may tell you that they're a dedicated

519
00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:30,259
saw play but from my perspective or what

520
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:33,889
I've seen I believe that it to be an

521
00:18:30,259 --> 00:18:37,879
additional element of their thing rather

522
00:18:33,889 --> 00:18:40,490
than necessarily their core intent in

523
00:18:37,879 --> 00:18:42,799
terms of what's best for you it really

524
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:45,769
depends the integrations that you need

525
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:50,139
you might be a Cisco shop or a Palo Alto

526
00:18:45,769 --> 00:18:51,919
shop or whatever shop maybe run all Mac

527
00:18:50,139 --> 00:18:53,389
desperate maybe everyone has a Mac

528
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,499
laptop and your work bare eyes to works

529
00:18:53,389 --> 00:18:56,199
they don't need to worry about Windows

530
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:59,690
there's a bunch of things that might

531
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:01,789
impact what works best for you if you

532
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:04,909
have existing vendors because so many of

533
00:19:01,789 --> 00:19:06,919
the saw vendors are being obviously a

534
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:09,470
this is not my techie view this is my

535
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:10,850
very pragmatic business guy view if you

536
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:12,590
have an existing very strong

537
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:14,240
relationship with one of the vendors

538
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:16,178
they will probably be more than happy to

539
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,649
cut you a really good deal on this stuff

540
00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:20,269
so I would definitely talk to you I've

541
00:19:18,649 --> 00:19:21,709
been looking around at saw platforms and

542
00:19:20,269 --> 00:19:23,269
this other stuff looks pretty good what

543
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:24,590
can you do for us mate and you know

544
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:25,639
they'll probably find in their heart to

545
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:28,549
give you a decent discount I would

546
00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:30,529
suggest your level of engineering talent

547
00:19:28,549 --> 00:19:33,619
like stack Storm and walk off and we're

548
00:19:30,529 --> 00:19:36,409
pretty cool but you need a certain level

549
00:19:33,619 --> 00:19:38,269
of in-house engineering which I'll talk

550
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:39,830
about in a bit and if you don't have

551
00:19:38,269 --> 00:19:43,549
that you probably going to need to rely

552
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:44,960
on support a bit more heavily yeah so

553
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:46,610
that is definitely consideration in

554
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,200
terms of what works for you whether your

555
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:49,908
capex vs. of X maybe you can just buy

556
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,169
something up front and do it maybe you

557
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:52,789
don't have that but you've got some

558
00:19:51,169 --> 00:19:54,859
gorilla budget in terms of your staffing

559
00:19:52,789 --> 00:19:56,629
you can use to build something speaking

560
00:19:54,859 --> 00:19:57,439
and also office politics you might

561
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:59,000
already have

562
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,740
your relationship with your vendors is

563
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,629
quite often not purely technical and you

564
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:05,389
might need to look it what's good and

565
00:20:02,629 --> 00:20:09,500
what's bad and you know the direction of

566
00:20:05,389 --> 00:20:11,178
the wind inside your IT function the

567
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,039
first thing that everyone wants to do

568
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:16,940
when they get their brand-new saw out of

569
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:18,440
the shrink-wrap is sold fishing I hate

570
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:21,649
to be the one to break it to you but

571
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:23,899
yeah that's like I think if we were

572
00:20:21,649 --> 00:20:26,000
going to sell fishing there wouldn't be

573
00:20:23,899 --> 00:20:27,709
what's probably six or so anti-phishing

574
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,590
vendors out there right now it's

575
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:32,690
probably outside of like I guess

576
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:34,519
technically malware was the first

577
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:35,960
computer security problem that we struck

578
00:20:34,519 --> 00:20:38,720
you know with Morris worm and whatever

579
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:41,750
but in terms of like facing regular

580
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,120
users phishing is the first problem like

581
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:45,500
Paul Brian first started applying sort

582
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,139
of like Bayes analytics and machine

583
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:50,450
learning to this stuff in I don't know

584
00:20:47,139 --> 00:20:53,209
like 96 or something crazy and we still

585
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:54,470
haven't got it yet I know it's a route

586
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,850
big resource drain for most companies

587
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:58,220
because it's very fiddly there's a lot

588
00:20:55,850 --> 00:21:00,860
going on it's a very context sensitive

589
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:02,870
it's very subjective like is this really

590
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:04,668
an email from DHL is this really an

591
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:06,469
email from PayPal that came from PayPal

592
00:21:04,669 --> 00:21:10,009
- survey com

593
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:11,299
it is unfortunately you know there's a

594
00:21:10,009 --> 00:21:13,309
bunch of your different topless domains

595
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:15,590
as eyepieces files there's files with

596
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:17,740
files the zips a zips with passwords

597
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:19,759
it's all very context sensitive

598
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:22,820
computers aren't very good at nuance and

599
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:26,240
context so yeah I wouldn't start with

600
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,408
phishing by any means maybe that's you

601
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,470
know you're really starting an expert

602
00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:33,649
mode start on easy mode

603
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:36,080
he'd probably maybe I started sketching

604
00:21:33,649 --> 00:21:38,090
one together for our training and at

605
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:41,120
this point that I didn't have any more

606
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:44,120
room on a slide for like the flows I

607
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:45,620
went yeah you know what screw this so

608
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,699
yeah pretty much what I said you've got

609
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,830
a bunch of places going to look things

610
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:51,019
up is there profiles is that bad domains

611
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:53,149
where'd all the output go how do i lock

612
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:56,149
any user if it's a phishing email sent

613
00:21:53,149 --> 00:21:58,100
to a VIP then I probably need to maybe

614
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:59,750
just talk to the VIP if they're super

615
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:01,610
important if the CEO got a phishing

616
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,690
email but they didn't click on it maybe

617
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:04,100
you want someone's to give them a nudge

618
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:05,149
and go hey I saw you got this bad email

619
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,619
just letting you know you know we're on

620
00:22:05,149 --> 00:22:09,469
top of it we're doing a good job it's a

621
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:10,570
good opportunity that they are you my

622
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:13,210
potential

623
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:14,889
you notice a malware outbreak because 17

624
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:17,220
people opened something in its mana

625
00:22:14,889 --> 00:22:22,000
process whatever it's very complicated

626
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:24,100
keep it for later however I think a good

627
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,200
place to start when it comes to

628
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:29,199
automation / orchestration and the -

629
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:33,279
probably bleed of it here is chat ops so

630
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:35,799
you can have a if you use internal chat

631
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:37,809
stuff I think almost everyone does even

632
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:40,889
the most stodgy of government

633
00:22:37,809 --> 00:22:44,740
departments is now using like a Java or

634
00:22:40,889 --> 00:22:45,879
link illicit Microsoft team chat or

635
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,110
whatever now there pretty much

636
00:22:45,879 --> 00:22:49,750
everyone's got some sort of chat thing

637
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:51,879
they use internally it's a really

638
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:53,860
natural way for humans to communicate

639
00:22:51,879 --> 00:22:56,590
and look things up without tabbing all

640
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:59,799
the time it also is interesting because

641
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:01,059
it means that you can work in public if

642
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:02,259
you've got junior people in your team

643
00:23:01,059 --> 00:23:04,840
and you're like running something down

644
00:23:02,259 --> 00:23:06,250
you've got an incident channel and

645
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,299
you're there and you look and stuff

646
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:09,610
harping on okay well I think we should

647
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:11,889
probably do this look up this okay I

648
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:13,870
want to get this sample these three

649
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:15,758
machines you type the commands you're

650
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:16,989
sort of effectively documenting it in

651
00:23:15,759 --> 00:23:19,389
front of other people so they can see

652
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:20,980
what it is that you did once you've done

653
00:23:19,389 --> 00:23:22,178
a few of those things using chat up so

654
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,470
you can get okay so what is it what we

655
00:23:22,179 --> 00:23:24,580
do whenever we deal with these instance

656
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:26,799
let's pull the logs of these channels

657
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:28,840
okay well that's a starting point if you

658
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,039
sort of know rating for your coworkers

659
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:31,600
is he dealing with an incident in the

660
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:33,610
chat ops channel you know you just

661
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,490
basically take that and formalize it as

662
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:40,658
a orchestration playbook and yeah it's

663
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:43,480
it's a pretty easy way to start one

664
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:44,529
interesting use case that I because yeah

665
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,149
I thought I shouldn't say don't do

666
00:23:44,529 --> 00:23:48,399
fishing and then sort of not say what

667
00:23:46,149 --> 00:23:51,309
else to do but I'm one that I think is

668
00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:53,739
really high value it's really high pain

669
00:23:51,309 --> 00:23:55,480
but a lot of people don't notice it is

670
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,970
the off-boarding of staff or for that

671
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,950
matter when people are traveling HR

672
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:02,649
almost every HR system has hooks in it

673
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:06,700
so you can go when is the staff member

674
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:09,100
being off boarded or you know if they

675
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,799
retired if they resigned suddenly

676
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:14,230
effective you know this afternoon which

677
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:16,029
you need to talk to your HR people and

678
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:18,879
make sure that you have you know

679
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:21,370
admittedly there is nuance in terms of

680
00:24:18,879 --> 00:24:23,520
someone got fired and someone resigned

681
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:25,169
effectively right now but you

682
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,790
probably want to be are to make sure

683
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:29,550
you're catching both groups of people in

684
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:30,629
terms of high risk you can lock out

685
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:32,280
people who are if you've got someone

686
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:33,960
who's on a month's leave and they

687
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:35,610
shouldn't have any duties should they

688
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:37,050
have their account active should they be

689
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:40,050
able to log into payroll and finance

690
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:41,580
systems whatever else if you do have

691
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:43,379
people who are suddenly terminated or

692
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,750
leave the organization you probably want

693
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:47,130
to lodge tickets you might want to do

694
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:49,080
something like pull the logs from their

695
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:50,010
workstation before it's very imaged if

696
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,689
you don't already pull them back

697
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:53,040
centrally a bunch of this stuff is

698
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:54,390
pretty easy to do but also the server

699
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:57,600
that matter just like when someone

700
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:58,920
leaves disabled their account turn their

701
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,379
account off it means that you stop

702
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:03,300
paying your IT provider for supporting a

703
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:04,830
user who's not really your user if they

704
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,270
haven't logged in in three years because

705
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:07,230
you know you bounced them awhile ago

706
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:09,570
they shouldn't have an active account

707
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:11,280
it's a really good way to tie your

708
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:13,020
security into these things that matter

709
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,370
to your organization and it's probably a

710
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,020
person whose job it is to do it by hand

711
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:17,239
and it probably really sucks and you can

712
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:22,139
give them more into the better stuff

713
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:24,120
with travelers I would restrict their

714
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:27,270
groups if you've got sysadmin who are

715
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:30,570
going on a holiday or a working trip to

716
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:31,950
Beijing I would and not by any means

717
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,510
only Beijing but basically if they're

718
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:35,700
traveling overseas and then don't have

719
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:37,530
sis admin tasks take away this is

720
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,660
certain privileges if they have access

721
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:41,520
to financial systems and they are not

722
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:44,100
currently doing finance stuff while

723
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,570
traveling turn it all off make them to a

724
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:48,809
PHA for everything if you have the knobs

725
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:50,639
and levers or let you do that alert on

726
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:51,750
any out of country login attempts that

727
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,490
aren't from people who are supposed to

728
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,840
be traveling if you can put all your

729
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:56,429
people in a traveling or not travelling

730
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,659
group you can look at the attempt so you

731
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:59,580
can find when you get a login attempt

732
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:00,059
from a country that someone was in two

733
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,280
months ago

734
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:03,629
isn't that interesting okay maybe we

735
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:07,139
need to pull panic and run around the

736
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:09,720
room for a while detonating malware if

737
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:11,670
you are an organization that deals in a

738
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,470
hands-on way with the malware that you

739
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:16,190
see this is probably a really good one

740
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:20,070
rather than manually handling it I'm

741
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:21,900
sure people accidentally run malware

742
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:24,149
when trying to drag it from the inbox

743
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:26,400
into the security tool quite often I've

744
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:28,260
never seen it but I'm sure it happens a

745
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,600
lot that's a really good case for

746
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:32,010
automation it goes to one place you pull

747
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,540
it your aunt through the sandbox based

748
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:35,490
on what the sandbox is and the rules in

749
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:36,960
the sandbox you can go and do a bunch of

750
00:26:35,490 --> 00:26:38,580
things as a result you probably

751
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,380
I think getting context about the

752
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:42,330
malware is particularly useful or even

753
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:44,820
for that matter if antivirus fires like

754
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:46,050
what type of malware was it well what

755
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,189
does that mean do we need to revoke all

756
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,850
the certificates that person has on

757
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:49,530
their machine

758
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:51,449
what certificates do they have what

759
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:52,649
passwords do they have what shared

760
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:53,700
passwords do you have in your

761
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:56,430
organization which are a bit naughty

762
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,810
that's a whole other thing but what else

763
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,650
is there if you want to get rid go like

764
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:01,020
hunting mode

765
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:03,090
I've never say you can automate hunting

766
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,620
but if you find something weird and you

767
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:05,100
can find things that are similar to the

768
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,260
weird

769
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:09,929
then that's close enough to being

770
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:11,610
hunting and you probably you can get

771
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:16,470
that little sort of bad Junior security

772
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:18,300
book that you now a hunter so like yeah

773
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:20,220
one example might be and this is

774
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,659
basically just taken directly out of our

775
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:24,720
training stuff but with the brains

776
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:26,700
removed if you have sis Mon on Windows

777
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:29,460
which if you don't have it it is free it

778
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,410
is made by a guy who now works worked at

779
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:33,660
Microsoft 15 years or something mark

780
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:37,170
russinovich whose name I can't say his

781
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:38,910
name anyway this one can get when

782
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:40,140
processes execute when they make network

783
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:41,310
connections when they make a registry

784
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:43,950
keys when they basically do anything

785
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:46,020
like sneeze on your system you can log

786
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:47,460
them into your event log in Windows you

787
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,810
have a collector that goes and runs it

788
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,090
into your security incident event

789
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:52,560
management platform it can go and send

790
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:54,659
notifications when something weird or

791
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:56,580
bad happens you can take those

792
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:58,470
notifications and you can run them into

793
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:01,080
your soar platform and then do something

794
00:27:58,470 --> 00:28:03,300
about it you could do something as easy

795
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:06,149
as oh this thing tries to talk to an

796
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:08,220
address that we don't like well that's

797
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,900
pretty weird you can you can kill the

798
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:11,280
process you can lock the file you can

799
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:13,050
grab a copy of the file you can drop it

800
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,060
into quarantine folder so your analysts

801
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:16,320
can deal with it rather than you know

802
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,970
potentially it might be you getting

803
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,429
alert by the time you get to it your abs

804
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:22,110
already killed it or something so having

805
00:28:20,430 --> 00:28:24,720
this type of workflow where you can

806
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:26,159
reach out and touch your endpoints if

807
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,590
you have a tested process is

808
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:31,350
particularly handy particularly so you

809
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:33,270
have an outbreak I wouldn't want to be

810
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:35,610
relying on your Platinum level support

811
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:38,340
for your antivirus provider to give you

812
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:42,060
the immediate response you need for

813
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:45,330
wanna cry 2.0 or whatever you know not

814
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:47,129
picture like if you know what the hash

815
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:48,990
is is on your network and you can run a

816
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:51,030
job that says find everything that has

817
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:52,830
this hash kill it and make the

818
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:55,470
you know basically disable the file and

819
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:57,179
then kill the process you know you'll

820
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:58,470
say for the day you don't want to do it

821
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,970
all the time that sometimes you're going

822
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:01,380
to need to do it and you don't want to

823
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:03,030
be building these things and running

824
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:07,140
shell scripts by hand when the badness

825
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:08,910
happens you want them in place in the

826
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:11,040
USA this is agent lists like you need

827
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:13,050
the logging agent thing but it's pretty

828
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,460
agentless there's not really a whole lot

829
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:16,050
of load in terms of running a bit of

830
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,130
system on on the box and you're not

831
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:19,320
running a bunch of proprietary software

832
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:24,240
you can do all this for free see me free

833
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:27,179
sim or a free store or whatever managing

834
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,430
incidents like github

835
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:30,510
they've gone extreme when it comes to

836
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:32,190
chat ups and the way that they

837
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:34,140
orchestrate you can see a little bit the

838
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:37,110
highlighted there they were getting a

839
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:41,220
what a 1.2 terabyte a second DDoS attack

840
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:43,290
and I can't find the story again but at

841
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:45,540
least as I our account as I recall it

842
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:48,540
one of their the engineer who was on

843
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:51,240
call was on his way to the airport to go

844
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:53,310
to a conference or something Herzog I

845
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:55,470
were getting ddosed you know flicked

846
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:57,919
over to his slack window and just type

847
00:29:55,470 --> 00:30:01,440
like exclamation mark shields up and

848
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:04,050
then that called a top action that went

849
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,320
and changed their BGP routing to send

850
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:09,030
them by their DDoS prediction provider

851
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:12,270
and it also they have all sorts of stuff

852
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:13,379
that they are like organizing incidents

853
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:15,420
particularly when you're a large

854
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:16,680
software company being able to go well

855
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:18,870
if you have chat ops commands or

856
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:20,460
automation orchestration god we've got a

857
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:21,719
major incident ok so I'm going to create

858
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:24,420
a channel for it

859
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,280
we need to page out the executives we

860
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,690
need to stand up a call we need to alert

861
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,889
these people we need to get people

862
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:30,870
around shift and do this we need to

863
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:32,250
clear calendars we need to book out the

864
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,419
meeting room all these things you

865
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:34,730
probably have a person doing at this

866
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:37,470
kind or a lot of stress automated

867
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:38,760
orchestrated it also means that your

868
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,930
processes are always followed it's

869
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:43,050
really neat you don't realize you forgot

870
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:46,170
to tell the you know the sigh so you

871
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:46,800
know a day later so yeah definitely

872
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:49,350
worth doing

873
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:51,000
using your orchestration platform I

874
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:53,730
don't know whether I changed my BGP

875
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:58,070
routes via chat ops but if you are super

876
00:30:53,730 --> 00:31:00,900
brave and or super smart you go for it

877
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:04,080
in terms of ideas if you are

878
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:06,000
orchestrating santen you

879
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,439
- wrong I don't think run anymore but

880
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,390
they used to like basically have like

881
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,800
cash prizes for the best entries and

882
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:12,420
competitions I think you burned every

883
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:14,940
month back when they first started out

884
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:16,620
so like the best integrations the best

885
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:19,110
playbook so that's whatever so they've

886
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:20,909
got a massive catalogue of them the

887
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:23,129
phantom ones are also quite easy to read

888
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:25,470
so even if you ain't not a phantom

889
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:27,150
customer you can see what the logical

890
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:28,830
flows and the integrations and stuff art

891
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:31,110
people use for certain problems and then

892
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:32,490
you can leverage that knowledge to give

893
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:34,590
you ideas on maybe what you're going to

894
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:37,980
do next and how you might do it and

895
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:39,179
misto ones are all MIT license so you

896
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,500
could literally port them that's

897
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:42,420
something I plan on maybe trying to do

898
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,880
next week is do some sort of mass

899
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:46,440
porting of them but they're a little bit

900
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,630
harder to read but they're also all

901
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:51,620
there and very detailed and you

902
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:51,620
integrate with a lot of different things

903
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:58,200
data flows I know - spent a lot of

904
00:31:56,370 --> 00:32:00,149
people have frustration with their

905
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,590
existing tools and they get a new tool

906
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:05,400
they want to use a new tool to do

907
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:09,149
everything I wouldn't do that I you want

908
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:11,340
to use your data like to do your data

909
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:13,260
like stuff you want to use your seam or

910
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:15,780
your alerting engine to do your alerting

911
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:18,300
you probably want to send those alerts

912
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:21,660
to your saw platform to do something

913
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:23,070
with them but you probably don't if you

914
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:25,230
can avoid it you don't really want to be

915
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:27,659
actively sweeping your network for

916
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:29,370
badness or whatever the case no they're

917
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:31,080
using your saw platform they're not

918
00:32:29,370 --> 00:32:33,209
generally designed for that they're not

919
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,100
the licensing model isn't usually great

920
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:36,660
for that you're better off using the

921
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,189
right tool for the right job and using

922
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:41,550
the saw for sort of joining everything

923
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:43,500
together but maybe have to but yeah try

924
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:45,570
it the other advantage to doing it that

925
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:48,360
that way is if you have a component you

926
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:51,090
don't want anymore like say you are

927
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:53,459
currently using so you're using

928
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:56,340
alienvault and you decide to go grey

929
00:32:53,460 --> 00:33:00,000
logged or you decide to drop Splunk and

930
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:02,100
go to a Hadoop cluster if you have all

931
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,570
of your response actions in your saw

932
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,280
you're only sort of swapping out one

933
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:07,220
component and then the web books go to

934
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:10,680
the same place you don't have to sort of

935
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:11,850
re-engineer everything from scratch yeah

936
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:15,080
by the same token if you swap to all

937
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:15,080
platforms that should be pretty easy

938
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:19,710
the

939
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:22,320
I always laugh literally really like

940
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:24,960
standards it's like big air quotes here

941
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:28,139
the collaborative open playbook standard

942
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:31,020
by Thomas though is it's definitely open

943
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:32,790
it is a standard but as far as I'm aware

944
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:33,960
they're the only implementer of said

945
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:35,580
standard and obviously they're the owner

946
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:38,130
of that standard but that said it was a

947
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:41,159
pretty sensible standard it is also very

948
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:44,940
similar in format to a lot of the other

949
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:47,340
stuff like um orchestra and mr. role and

950
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:49,470
a few of the other like OpenStack

951
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:50,669
related products or stack storm related

952
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:52,980
products in terms of the way that they

953
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:54,000
do them so they're not quite

954
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,710
interoperable that they're not that far

955
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,180
off so but it is cool that they write a

956
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:58,620
standard and they go here's how it works

957
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:00,390
he's how it's documented everyone can

958
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:02,340
use this I really applaud any effort to

959
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:07,860
try and make it so you don't get vendor

960
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:10,710
lock-in open situ is a standard on what

961
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:12,239
you should do in order to sort of

962
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:14,520
mitigate something

963
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:17,219
it's basically a standard for response

964
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:20,670
they own they control sticks which is

965
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:22,679
the standard for threat Intel and the

966
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:24,600
main standard for threat Intel and open

967
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:27,029
c2 is their attempt at having a standard

968
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:29,880
for what you do about threat Intel and

969
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:31,620
how you apply that to your tooling in

970
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:34,350
terms of portability and interoperation

971
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:36,179
between the platforms almost all of them

972
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:38,659
have Python code is the way they're

973
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:42,500
integrations and whatever are written

974
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:45,330
phantom has it's works always play books

975
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:46,800
effectively as Python that sort of takes

976
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:52,219
all the different parts and sort of

977
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:55,260
bakes them into one Python module class

978
00:34:52,219 --> 00:34:57,060
when you run them but yeah well they

979
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,230
pretty much all have Python some of them

980
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:01,230
have an option for JavaScript as well

981
00:34:58,230 --> 00:35:03,300
but I don't see it using used as option

982
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:06,330
often I would probably stick to Python

983
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:07,560
and if you can I would use Python 3

984
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:09,690
because you can have types and stuff

985
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,310
that stop you from accidentally smashing

986
00:35:09,690 --> 00:35:13,140
a word into a number or something and I

987
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:15,420
think a horribly wrong they almost all

988
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:19,520
use yeah more configs it's not my

989
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:22,380
favorite but it's something you can do

990
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:24,450
Jason which is you've probably all seen

991
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:28,190
is a you know it's like the the

992
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:31,029
JavaScript object notation jason is a

993
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:34,480
subset of Gamal Gamal can

994
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:36,100
Jason so you can probably take the

995
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:40,030
configs between them do a search and

996
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:41,620
replace and make them work mostly but

997
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:43,240
you know I definitely have to applaud to

998
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:46,720
Miss dough for making all their stuff

999
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:48,490
open and like proper free free not just

1000
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:54,370
free for money but you know free for

1001
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:55,899
freedom engineering overheads this is

1002
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,950
the bit if you are all like yeah this is

1003
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:58,390
awesome I'm going to do this one go back

1004
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:01,839
this is maybe the thing that'll make you

1005
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:04,029
go there are always engineering

1006
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:06,010
overheads the platforms are pretty clean

1007
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:09,550
and easy to run and not super

1008
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:11,410
over-the-top I liked it when I searched

1009
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:13,660
for like square peg round hole

1010
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:17,529
it actually was very literal about it

1011
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:18,970
being a metaphor for that image it's why

1012
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:22,500
that image exists I don't know but I'm

1013
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:24,189
glad I could use it yeah a lot of the

1014
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:28,570
integrations that you have don't

1015
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:29,890
necessarily spit out the data in the way

1016
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:32,560
that another one you want to feed it to

1017
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:35,080
will want it you might have say like

1018
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:38,290
mail filtering stuff that dfangs the

1019
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:40,270
urls like it replaces HTTP with h x XP

1020
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:42,910
on the hour or something if you go and

1021
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:43,930
pass it into your malware sandbox it's

1022
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:45,700
probably like what the hell's this this

1023
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:47,950
isn't a valid URL so you might need sort

1024
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,640
of stuff to like adjust things back to

1025
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:50,799
the way they should be

1026
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,049
maybe something it just checks a list

1027
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,990
but it should be just a single IP

1028
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:57,070
address or you take a URL and you need

1029
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:58,359
to pass a domain name to something

1030
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:59,620
there's always like just that little bit

1031
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:03,160
of engineering in the middle that means

1032
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:04,890
that you probably want some software

1033
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:07,029
development slush engineering in-house

1034
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:10,060
even if it's just someone who's you know

1035
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:11,710
done a two day course in Python there's

1036
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,940
probably enough to get you there you

1037
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:14,320
don't need to be writing big software

1038
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:16,050
you just need basic sort of scripting

1039
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:20,110
stuff

1040
00:37:16,050 --> 00:37:21,880
testing testing is hard like when you

1041
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:25,000
mess up on the machine you mess up on a

1042
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:26,740
machine when you mess up on a thousand

1043
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,560
machines at once you know this sort of

1044
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:31,029
like yeah it's you got to test your

1045
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:33,040
software you got to keep testing your

1046
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:34,570
software you might apply a Windows patch

1047
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,400
or something that maybe makes things not

1048
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:39,870
work the way it used to so you need

1049
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:42,130
firstly you need actual testing for your

1050
00:37:39,870 --> 00:37:43,618
integrations but you also need to test

1051
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:44,849
them regularly and make sure that

1052
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:46,940
still working the way they're supposed

1053
00:37:44,849 --> 00:37:49,859
to like if you apply patches or whatever

1054
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:51,329
but yeah it's testing is super important

1055
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:54,269
because you could easily I'm gonna

1056
00:37:51,329 --> 00:37:56,069
delete Excel off your fleet I have

1057
00:37:54,269 --> 00:37:57,988
worked at a place where antivirus

1058
00:37:56,069 --> 00:37:59,910
flagged Excel one morning and yeah

1059
00:37:57,989 --> 00:38:01,380
everyone lost Excel no one could do any

1060
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:02,609
spreadsheets for the day I don't know

1061
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,319
how we all didn't go Lord of the Flies

1062
00:38:02,609 --> 00:38:05,930
and you know start stuffing show there

1063
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:08,788
were Spears but you know we got there

1064
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:10,259
yeah it's you gotta be careful you don't

1065
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:11,789
want to be the one who wiped out the

1066
00:38:10,259 --> 00:38:13,589
fleet and it's very easier to do with

1067
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:15,450
orchestration unless you have humans in

1068
00:38:13,589 --> 00:38:17,460
the loop to say hey is this a good idea

1069
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:19,169
do you want to do this I would advise

1070
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:22,859
you the same as with threat Intel I

1071
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:25,950
would never action threat Intel or a

1072
00:38:22,859 --> 00:38:27,630
serious alert without having a human

1073
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:29,218
click the yeah I'm ok with this no I'm

1074
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:31,979
not and probably more so than clicking

1075
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:33,359
yes and no I would have something a

1076
00:38:31,979 --> 00:38:35,968
little bit more acknowledged II so they

1077
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:38,509
actually like know what they're doing

1078
00:38:35,969 --> 00:38:41,009
though it's going yeah yeah yeah yeah

1079
00:38:38,509 --> 00:38:43,019
almost out of time this is my last slide

1080
00:38:41,009 --> 00:38:43,999
so I said well ok in terms of making it

1081
00:38:43,019 --> 00:38:46,319
actually happen inside your organization

1082
00:38:43,999 --> 00:38:48,029
stand up a project to protect the time

1083
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:49,529
and resources from operational tasks

1084
00:38:48,029 --> 00:38:51,660
most of you are at a hundred percent

1085
00:38:49,529 --> 00:38:53,579
utilization at the moment so there's no

1086
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:55,589
room to give yourselves more room you

1087
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:57,989
need to set aside 20 percent or whatever

1088
00:38:55,589 --> 00:39:00,150
of your time so you can actually get rid

1089
00:38:57,989 --> 00:39:02,910
of the other 80% so you have more time

1090
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:04,440
to do this stuff I'm or one team where

1091
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:07,049
they pretty much I wouldn't say they

1092
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:09,150
play foosball all day but they've almost

1093
00:39:07,049 --> 00:39:10,619
reached nirvana they just looking for

1094
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:12,660
more stuff to automate you know it's

1095
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:14,039
like really diminishing returns they

1096
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:16,229
just sit there in the machines go poop

1097
00:39:14,039 --> 00:39:18,450
at them and they go yeah it's like you

1098
00:39:16,229 --> 00:39:19,919
can get there it's good start small find

1099
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:21,058
something that's achievable show

1100
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,229
everyone how you achieved it that's

1101
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:24,239
great then working under the hard stuffs

1102
00:39:22,229 --> 00:39:25,769
don't start with phishing yet find

1103
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:28,529
actual cost savings you can get that

1104
00:39:25,769 --> 00:39:30,598
show the ROI not like intangibles but if

1105
00:39:28,529 --> 00:39:32,519
you can actually save money inside your

1106
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:34,229
organization and turn our infants faster

1107
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:35,910
that's great putting a revision control

1108
00:39:34,229 --> 00:39:38,489
early in case you break something you

1109
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:40,288
don't know about it and think about the

1110
00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:43,319
confidentiality and creepiness of what

1111
00:39:40,289 --> 00:39:45,119
you're doing in case it's very easy to

1112
00:39:43,319 --> 00:39:47,609
get invasive with gathering tamo tree so

1113
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:50,670
I think about that I don't know if I

1114
00:39:47,609 --> 00:39:51,839
have time for questions but ok yeah

1115
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:54,150
we've got about five minutes for

1116
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:55,499
questions so first of all can we please

1117
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:56,470
have a round of applause for Cain that

1118
00:39:55,499 --> 00:39:59,759
was AB

1119
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:59,759
[Applause]

1120
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:08,920
so by a order of magnitude I think this

1121
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,450
is probably the best speaker gift I've

1122
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,190
ever seen I would definitely agree with

1123
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:16,980
you on that one The Legend of Zelda

1124
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:16,980
chess set so thank you very much right

1125
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:26,200
so we have also app as well so you can

1126
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:27,910
go online and actually rate and feedback

1127
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:30,100
and whatnot so you know so we can make

1128
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:31,600
this better but not for questions first

1129
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:34,750
there's anyone have any questions I'll

1130
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:37,900
run around for microphone one in the

1131
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:39,430
back there in the center reluctantly put

1132
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:41,560
up his hand for set okay make sure you

1133
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:45,850
all tonight slides of the room so Lucas

1134
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:49,259
he steps in would you ever consider

1135
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:52,390
using ansible running the place builders

1136
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:54,340
yes like we use ansible a lot for our

1137
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:56,920
infrastructure like we're effectively an

1138
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:59,290
answerable shop but and there is

1139
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:04,090
sensible circle stuff coming out but it

1140
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:05,860
doesn't it isn't is event-driven so you

1141
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:07,630
could have something that calls an

1142
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:11,200
answerable playbook but it isn't sort of

1143
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:12,430
if this then that is much but the other

1144
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,600
thing is if you've got it and if you're

1145
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:15,310
using it in your fleet and everyone's

1146
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:17,110
comfortable with it you know it's it's

1147
00:41:15,310 --> 00:41:19,330
better than not doing it so but yeah I

1148
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:21,310
mean I'd if they add it's a few little

1149
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:23,080
bits and pieces yeah definitely but as

1150
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:24,640
it is it wouldn't be my preferred choice

1151
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,779
but once again if you got it and it's a

1152
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,930
out there and seen you fly yeah

1153
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:31,030
definitely thanks mate any other

1154
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:35,290
questions I'll run around get my steps

1155
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:36,640
up no the use case he had up before I

1156
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:38,290
thought was really good the one where

1157
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:40,359
around the to factor or about people

1158
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:41,590
traveling and whatnot on red team's it's

1159
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:44,200
quite common for us to have a look at

1160
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:45,970
the internal calendar and see who's on

1161
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,680
leave and then specifically target their

1162
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:50,649
account to use that around the network

1163
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:52,660
because it's very unlikely to be noticed

1164
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:54,700
by the individual as well so really good

1165
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:56,290
use case for that matter the out of

1166
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:58,839
office you just email the whole

1167
00:41:56,290 --> 00:42:00,550
organization or the everyone at address

1168
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,870
and you just go after the people as

1169
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:03,250
they're out of office because they won't

1170
00:42:01,870 --> 00:42:05,440
be using that password so your might as

1171
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:07,210
well change it absolutely were the only

1172
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,260
other questions at all well might if

1173
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:09,059
there were not all the ones we'll call

1174
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,650
it there

1175
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:13,489
so thank you very much okay thank

1176
