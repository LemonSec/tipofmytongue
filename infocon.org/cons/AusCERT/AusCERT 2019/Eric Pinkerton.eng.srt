1
00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:05,250
this morning we've got Eric Pinkston

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,410
from hyvent a trust wire company

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,210
now an optics company as well moved from

4
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:11,400
Singh cell he's suffering a bit of an

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,900
identity crisis but many of you've

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:14,280
probably already seen and know Eric from

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,900
cutting up the rugged many conferences

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:21,299
around the country so if everyone could

9
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:28,230
prove please welcome Eric thanks fellow

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:31,140
mark you hear me tough ok so when I

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,210
submitted this paper in truth I didn't

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,399
really fully know what this talk was

13
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:37,020
going to be and where it was going to go

14
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,460
so it's been an interesting journey and

15
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:41,070
it's been a very different one for me so

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:44,430
so hopefully you enjoy the ride but

17
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:46,710
let's dive in so the first thing I

18
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,500
noticed when I went to conferences and

19
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:51,780
started seeing presentations about risk

20
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,120
is that for some reason all risk people

21
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,370
are obsessed with aircraft and planes

22
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:59,309
and they talk about planes and plane

23
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:00,780
crashes and black box recorders I don't

24
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:04,170
never really figured out quite what that

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:08,549
is but I think it leads to a style of

26
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:10,740
thinking about risk that is essentially

27
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,560
that your business is an aeroplane and

28
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:15,149
risk is a mountain and you need to steer

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:19,439
around the mountain or over the mountain

30
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:22,350
and that's how we avoid the risks and I

31
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,470
think that's that it's kind of not quite

32
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,899
right what I want to talk about today is

33
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,280
is risk appetite but before I do that

34
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,290
I'm going to give you a little bit of a

35
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,460
primer on risk and I'll flick through it

36
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:33,750
pretty quickly because I'm assuming that

37
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:36,298
everyone has a reasonable understanding

38
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:41,610
of it anyone recognized that mountain by

39
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:47,189
the way that's a Toblerone mountain toad

40
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:49,140
romantic just kidding so I tend to think

41
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:52,199
about risk a bit like this so your

42
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,049
business is a ship and you're the ocean

43
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,280
is risk and maybe you're a pirate maybe

44
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,840
you've got one I kiss risks have a

45
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,840
Pirates have a particularly high risk

46
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,130
appetite and risk people are coming to

47
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,110
you saying well in order to remove the

48
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,810
risk we need to take the boat out of the

49
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,250
ocean and put it on high ground and

50
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:09,780
you'll kind of hang on a minute if I

51
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,038
take my boat out of the ocean put it on

52
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,510
high ground now what I've got is a

53
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:17,760
sloping warehouse with crappy access

54
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:20,959
the your business needs to be enveloped

55
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,950
by risk in order to do what it does and

56
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,350
managing the risk isn't about just

57
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:27,720
removing it it's about you know thinking

58
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:30,420
about life jackets and training and the

59
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,000
journey and the type of journeys you're

60
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,350
going to make and the type of vessel you

61
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,300
have them whether it's fit for purpose

62
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:44,220
on the type of journey you're going to

63
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:46,020
make the rubber meets the road for risk

64
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:50,760
in my favorite thing which is the five

65
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:52,650
by five risk matrix if you're greedy you

66
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,239
might have a seven by seven or a six by

67
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:58,290
six but for most people are five by five

68
00:02:54,240 --> 00:03:00,500
risk matrix is where it all happens I've

69
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:03,739
note down in the bottom we have the

70
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:06,870
Black Swan event which is the conceptual

71
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:08,550
9/11 or the Pearl Harbor now this is

72
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,590
what we have insurance for this this

73
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:12,930
little part down here but oops

74
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,550
essentially this this is what most

75
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:17,550
people's risk registers look like and

76
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:20,010
this is a tool to separate the and

77
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:22,800
prioritize the things that that we find

78
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,120
and the way it works is essentially we

79
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,209
come up with a list of all the bad

80
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,890
things that happen we sort them by order

81
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:31,200
with the critical stuff at the top

82
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:33,029
number one is our butterfly flaps its

83
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,980
wings in Brazil and a year later all our

84
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,959
customers data appears on paste bin and

85
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,350
we go down that list to acknowledge that

86
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,970
there's a couple of things or a few

87
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:43,680
things that we just the unknown unknowns

88
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:47,670
we have we have no ideas what they are

89
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:51,750
so we don't really do much with those we

90
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:53,820
then set out to treat them and the way

91
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,160
we treat them as we avoid it we reduce

92
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:58,350
it we transfer it we accept it or we put

93
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:02,609
it in a risk register put our things in

94
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:04,620
or isn't la la la la la then what kind

95
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,810
of happens now we've got our risk is

96
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:08,790
they go over into the organize in the

97
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:10,380
context of the organization or aesthetic

98
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:13,590
I'm talking about cyber risk here and

99
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:15,180
cyber risk appetite so they go into the

100
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:18,630
organizational risk of which there are

101
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:22,350
many many more and you'll see that now

102
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:24,719
my my cyber risk number one the

103
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,020
butterfly in the Amazon is now number

104
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,979
nine on the list

105
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:32,440
and in most organizations whether it's

106
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:34,539
admitted or not there's this conceptual

107
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,340
dotted line that is the difference

108
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:37,870
between the stuff you do and the stuff

109
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:41,609
you don't know how you put it in the

110
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:44,139
risk register it another way and and

111
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:45,729
this is kind of how I think about risk

112
00:04:44,139 --> 00:04:47,800
risk isn't about finding and fixing all

113
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:49,599
the issues that are facing your

114
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,919
organization is about knowledge that you

115
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:52,449
don't have the time the money the

116
00:04:50,919 --> 00:04:56,710
resources to fix all the problems and

117
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:58,690
then creating a defensible position and

118
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:01,120
justification not just for the things

119
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:03,909
you do but but some justification for

120
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,770
the things you decide not to do and this

121
00:05:03,909 --> 00:05:07,449
is what surprises a lot of people in

122
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:09,159
cyber risk that they just come up with a

123
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:10,960
list of things they take it to the

124
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:12,430
business the business decides to do

125
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,859
nothing about it and they think it's

126
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:17,199
because the organization doesn't

127
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,360
understand risk but more often than not

128
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,740
it's because the cyber people don't

129
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,000
understand the organization and don't

130
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,139
understand that those risks in the

131
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,599
context of the other things the

132
00:05:23,139 --> 00:05:30,699
businesses is wrangling don't don't

133
00:05:25,599 --> 00:05:35,500
really make the list of things to do so

134
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:37,449
let's talk about risk appetite so as a

135
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:40,270
consultant I often find myself asking

136
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:41,529
the question what is your cyber risk out

137
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:44,169
or what's your outside for cyber risk

138
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:47,110
and if I'm really honest to myself one

139
00:05:44,169 --> 00:05:49,659
of the reasons I do this is basically

140
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:51,490
for shiggles and it's kind of like I'm

141
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:54,370
Columbo and I already know the answer

142
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:55,630
and they don't know the answer and they

143
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,759
always say the same thing they would say

144
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:59,349
oh we have a really low appetite for

145
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,759
risk for you we have a low appetite for

146
00:05:59,349 --> 00:06:02,469
cyber risk and I'm kind of like mate

147
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:04,900
I've seen your pen test reports for the

148
00:06:02,469 --> 00:06:06,969
last three years if your risk appetite

149
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:10,239
was a sport it would be like naked BASE

150
00:06:06,969 --> 00:06:11,979
jumping so here we are that we band

151
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,940
around this concept of risk appetite and

152
00:06:11,979 --> 00:06:17,919
and there seems to be a very frequently

153
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,659
disparity in the risk appetite that

154
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,359
organizations think they have in turn

155
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:24,699
don't forget I'm talking about cyber and

156
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:28,229
what it actually looks like in in truth

157
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:32,670
or what I see through through my jaded

158
00:06:28,229 --> 00:06:35,310
glasses or my my embittered view

159
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:36,870
so here we are what and what I set out

160
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:40,260
to do with this organization is talk

161
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:42,960
about what what is risk appetite what is

162
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:46,230
my risk appetite it's an organization ok

163
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,440
Wow what should it be then ouch

164
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:50,520
how can I change it how can I modify it

165
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,500
so if you see me talk before you'll know

166
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,789
that I'm a big fan of analogies I like

167
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,580
to come up with a nice

168
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:59,160
easy-to-understand analogy take it out

169
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,570
of into that space play with it and then

170
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,790
and then drop it back you know my

171
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:04,560
colleague in Perth likes to call this

172
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:07,620
knowledge scaffold kind of ironically

173
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,390
and so I think that a nice analogy for

174
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,330
risk appetite in order to understand it

175
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:14,219
is the concept of shrinkage in retail so

176
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,690
we all know about shrinkage essentially

177
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,730
if you're a shopkeeper the stock you

178
00:07:15,690 --> 00:07:19,590
purchased the stock you saw - the stock

179
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:21,810
you've sold - the stock that you've

180
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:24,359
spoiled and - the stock you still have

181
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:27,510
is shrinkage so you know if we imagine

182
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:30,090
I'm a shopkeeper and I have a hundredth

183
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:31,920
I don't know crack pipes and I sell 90

184
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,419
of them and I drop one of them on the

185
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:35,160
floor and now there's eight left on the

186
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,750
shelf and I'm like hang on a minute

187
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,700
one of them's gone missing right so

188
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:42,510
that's my shrinkage I've got 1%

189
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:45,240
shrinkage most retailers lose about 1.8

190
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:50,340
percent of their stock fashion retailers

191
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:52,200
it goes up to 2.4 3 % so now 1% of loss

192
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,849
I'm actually stoked especially when you

193
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:58,950
consider that most of my customers are

194
00:07:53,850 --> 00:08:01,920
crack addict right so the the next thing

195
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:03,539
is is you look at self-service checkouts

196
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,880
know when self-service checkouts became

197
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:07,050
a thing I'm guessing that that like me

198
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:08,430
most the people this room had a little

199
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,290
bit of a brain orgasm and they were kind

200
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:13,500
of like wow I could just walk out with

201
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:16,440
stuff and shrinkage in self-service

202
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:19,770
checkouts goes up to about 4% from from

203
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,120
one-and-a-half 1.8% and retail is called

204
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,909
the sweetheart thing which comes from

205
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,050
the practice of checkout operators

206
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,400
pretending to swipe things for their

207
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:28,470
loved ones and their family and their

208
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,789
sweethearts it's the same but now you're

209
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:31,050
sort of self-serving because you're

210
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:32,820
loving yourself and you're in your

211
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:34,950
you're the one who's wearing batteries

212
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,140
and saying it's carrots and I'm walking

213
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:40,490
out so so we know that the shrinkage

214
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:43,020
goes up but the interesting thing is

215
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:45,240
business you know retailers are less

216
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,470
concerned about that because of the

217
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,210
gains that they've made

218
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:52,230
by not having to employ as many checkout

219
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:53,760
operators I'm never going to have

220
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:56,130
self-service in my crack pipe Emporium

221
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,260
by the way and so so what's happening

222
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,570
obviously no store wants to lose you

223
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:02,760
know 2% of its stock to Winona Ryder

224
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:04,050
but retailers tolerate it as a cost of

225
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,140
doing business providing that it's

226
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:08,430
consistent so it's predictable and it's

227
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,840
a manageable number it's more or less

228
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:12,810
what everyone else in your sector is

229
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:15,270
putting up with them now you have

230
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:17,310
several levers that you can influence

231
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:20,579
that percentage with with as a store

232
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:24,479
manager you've got CCTV you've got store

233
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:28,170
detectives you've got alarm systems and

234
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,790
with dye packs security guards in the UK

235
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,490
we have the most effective measure of

236
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:37,800
all for shoplifters is cardboard

237
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:39,630
policeman bizarrely the other

238
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:43,410
interesting thing is it's completely

239
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:45,240
possible for store keepers to cut

240
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:48,540
shrinkage completely out so if you think

241
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,860
about 2425 garage shrinkage go through

242
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:51,689
the roof because most of the customers

243
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:53,160
or a large percentage of customers are

244
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:55,770
under the influence of something so they

245
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,390
install one of these drawers and of

246
00:09:55,770 --> 00:10:02,100
course when the drawer is in operation

247
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:04,949
at 4 a.m. shrinkage is effectively zero

248
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,600
but the trade-off to that is that sales

249
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:08,280
also drop down dand I know this because

250
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,630
I'm a very romantic person and I

251
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:11,610
sometimes like to buy flowers for my

252
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:13,230
wife but I'm far less likely to buy it

253
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,210
flowers for my wife at 4 a.m. from the

254
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:16,920
24-hour garage if the attendants going

255
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:18,690
to shove them through the drawer because

256
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,979
my wife's probably already mad at me and

257
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,970
it's not going to help if I give her

258
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:25,230
some flowers that have been through the

259
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:28,530
draw so if you think about those

260
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:32,790
concepts and and then we try to bring

261
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:35,640
them into the realm of cyber it's kind

262
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:38,699
of difficult to define an acceptable

263
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,430
loss in cyber as my head of thought what

264
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:44,280
is the equivalent of shrinkage in cyber

265
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:46,890
for denial of service attacks or oh I'm

266
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,480
offline for a day that might be easy to

267
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:51,770
quantify depending on the type of

268
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:56,130
business they're in but we don't have a

269
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:58,970
relative equivalent so here's what

270
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:58,970
here's what I came up with

271
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:04,790
so I won't read them all out but you get

272
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,290
the idea it was the worst Christmas ever

273
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,900
the metric that we have for measuring

274
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:12,180
loss and not consistent across different

275
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:14,640
organizations and they're very hard to

276
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:16,290
measure in a meaningful way and by

277
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,510
contrast the levers we have for

278
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:20,849
adjusting those things are endless so

279
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:25,529
firewalls IDs seem rosary beads you name

280
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:27,330
it so so what do so the risk people in

281
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:29,970
the room will obviously know if they've

282
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:31,529
been to any trading that it boils down

283
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:34,440
to money in the financial cost of a

284
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:36,960
breach all you need to do is calculate

285
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:39,240
the cost of a breach to you and then use

286
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,860
that to a formula you're in your risk

287
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,610
appetite how much money am I willing to

288
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:46,200
learn and to this we had some help from

289
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:48,180
we've had various companies do this IBM

290
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,820
did one last year where they worked out

291
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:54,660
on average the cost of a breach for each

292
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:56,100
record loss was 148 dollars so y'all

293
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,900
helped you know one hundred and forty

294
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,510
eight dollars a pop how many of those am

295
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:03,870
I willing to lose but the problem is

296
00:12:00,510 --> 00:12:05,640
this is that's to me you know we look at

297
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:08,610
the the cost from in different countries

298
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:11,310
and how this worked out what's and to me

299
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:13,650
these because they're averages and their

300
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:14,550
statistics and they are aggregated

301
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,870
across all sorts of different

302
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,120
organizations they're completely

303
00:12:15,870 --> 00:12:19,650
meaningless and it's incredibly

304
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,750
difficult to calculate the cost of a

305
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:23,339
breach you haven't had when if we're

306
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,870
honest it's almost impossible to

307
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:27,960
calculate the cost of the breaches we

308
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:29,010
have had and also a breach that you

309
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:31,110
haven't had as a hell of a lot cheaper

310
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:32,490
than one that you have had because what

311
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,080
you're doing when you have had a breach

312
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:37,560
is spending a fortune in quick

313
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:39,510
succession to mitigate risks if you've

314
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,640
got mandiant running around patching

315
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:43,589
things in a weekend that you could have

316
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,390
done or should have done over 12 months

317
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:48,780
it's gonna cost you a lot more and it's

318
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:51,180
not a useful number watching people

319
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:53,160
trying to work out this stuff to me

320
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:55,050
reminds me of a timer I went to buy a

321
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:57,689
bed and I walked into the bed shop and

322
00:12:55,050 --> 00:13:00,240
the guy in the shops kind of okay how

323
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:02,250
much do you want to spend on a bed and I

324
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,810
was kind of like never I've never bought

325
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,670
a bed not that I'd been sleeping on

326
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:07,760
cardboard or anything but you know I

327
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:10,319
think my parents had bought beds with me

328
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,880
so the conversation went

329
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,920
sorry the conversation went like this

330
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:15,510
how much do one spend on the bed I don't

331
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,910
know how much do people spend on beds

332
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:19,770
all it's a difficult question how long's

333
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:22,949
a piece of string how much did you spend

334
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:25,110
on your car I don't know about 40k okay

335
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:27,300
well how long do you spend in your car

336
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,950
maybe an hour a day okay

337
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,160
well how long do you spend in your bed

338
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:34,470
maybe eight hours a day tap tap tap tap

339
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,010
tap tap tap you might want to lie down

340
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:39,450
sir

341
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:45,480
so it's it's nylon impossible to work

342
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:46,800
this work this stuff out so the other

343
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,450
thing is is something that I talked

344
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,650
about last year which was around

345
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:51,360
reputational damage and how you

346
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:53,040
calculate the cost to a business and

347
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,030
reputational damage and that the reality

348
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:59,099
is it it's not impossible so some people

349
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:00,480
believe that the great white hope for

350
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:02,070
this and putting numbers on this thing

351
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,200
is the insurance industry because that's

352
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:06,330
what they do they collect heaps and

353
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,830
heaps of empirical data they get their

354
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:10,500
actuaries and they Montecarlo the

355
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:12,390
producers out of it and for the reason

356
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,220
they know that your car is less likely

357
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,780
to be damaged when you go and insure

358
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:17,690
your car if you work inside security

359
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,560
than when you work in nightclub security

360
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,630
they know they're gonna know what a

361
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:23,670
breach costs right they have you know

362
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:25,980
the problem is that they have decades of

363
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:28,050
information and detail police reports

364
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:30,510
with which to base the calculations

365
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:32,069
about car theft and car damage on but

366
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:34,380
they don't have that data about

367
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:36,210
cybersecurity and more often than not

368
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:38,130
what they're insuring people for on what

369
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:39,840
they're paying out isn't the cost of the

370
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:41,310
breach so much as the cost of cleaning

371
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:45,900
up after the breach which is quite a

372
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:47,969
different proposition and I struggle to

373
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:50,840
see how anyone is going to compile

374
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:54,810
meaningful information about this stuff

375
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:56,670
to the point where you know it's my view

376
00:14:54,810 --> 00:15:01,920
that qualitative risk assessment is like

377
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:03,420
is its finger in the wind as and people

378
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,069
say well the answer is quantitative risk

379
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:07,740
assessment where you take lots of that

380
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:09,210
information and this is what I think is

381
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,530
happening here is that there are people

382
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,980
out there who are talking about

383
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:15,329
quantitative risk assessment and

384
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:17,850
analysis of this numbers and Monte Carlo

385
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:20,340
this numbers but as a old-school IT guy

386
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,170
I know that garbage in garbage out up

387
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:23,670
until the point where you've got so much

388
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:25,199
information you can start

389
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:27,360
getting some meaningful things but I

390
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:29,970
don't think anyone's got that quality of

391
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:32,060
data and it's meaningful so I tend to

392
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:34,410
think that people who are talking about

393
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,880
coming up with meaningful numbers from

394
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:38,699
the data set we've got are either naive

395
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:40,770
or that or they're being dishonest the

396
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:43,170
other thing about insurance is so the

397
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:44,730
fundamental tenets of insurance or one

398
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:47,360
of the fact the the fundamental tenants

399
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:51,180
is that you may made whole doctrine

400
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:53,490
so essentially what that means is if I

401
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,109
know someone steals the correct pipe my

402
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:58,010
insurance provider should pay out for

403
00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:00,420
the cost of my crack pipe if I'm insured

404
00:15:58,010 --> 00:16:02,160
unless they can weasel out of it somehow

405
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:04,260
because it turns out that apparently

406
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,699
it's an offence to sell supply display a

407
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,200
sale of balm or ice pipes or the

408
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:08,580
component parts of a pipe whether the

409
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:11,280
Bob Hope is intended to be used to

410
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:13,110
administer prohibited drug so I digress

411
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,310
the point is good luck trying to make

412
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:15,720
your company whole again after you get a

413
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:18,689
call from Troy hunt to say that all your

414
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,830
records are on pastebin and they're

415
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:26,040
insuring you for that cost of the

416
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:30,210
cleanup so what do we do well I think

417
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:32,040
that the risk appetite is everyone has

418
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:33,930
one and I'm not talk about risk appetite

419
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,329
statements and it's a bit like your

420
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:38,579
cholesterol level so your cholesterol

421
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:40,920
level might be ideal and you can keep on

422
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:43,170
shoving burgers in your face or it might

423
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,030
not be it might be to lower it might be

424
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:46,860
too high both of which could mean that

425
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,510
you're imminently in trouble and

426
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:50,040
everybody's different some people might

427
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,970
have high cholesterol and live so 100

428
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,099
and then die in and they could

429
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:54,930
base-jumping accident but the point is

430
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,670
it's not Schrodinger's cat unless you

431
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:59,880
know what it is you can't begin to make

432
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:01,589
whatever changes you need to make which

433
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,630
means you how do we measure it well for

434
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:11,250
me we go back to this and we talked

435
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:15,240
about that conceptual dotted line excuse

436
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:18,060
me that is effectively your appetite for

437
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,010
risk manifest that is the difference

438
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:22,200
between the stuff you do and the stuff

439
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:24,800
you don't and higher or lower that line

440
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:28,380
is on your in your in your organization

441
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:31,290
that is a real strong indicator of what

442
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:34,080
your the effective risk appetite is and

443
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:37,149
any levers that you can use to move that

444
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,310
up or down is is worthy

445
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:42,310
consideration so things that I've seen

446
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:45,760
used is efforts so we sort things by

447
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:46,960
risk and we go well we we've only got

448
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:48,490
enough money to do these things so these

449
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,380
are things we're going to do sometimes

450
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:52,960
if you reorder it by the amount of

451
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,430
effort it takes to fix it you can knock

452
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,080
off something that's much lower on the

453
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:58,450
list because it's only effectively a

454
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,409
day's work the other thing that someone

455
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,610
was talking to me the other day that I

456
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:04,210
found quite interesting with the speed

457
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:05,469
of risk so resourcing these things

458
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,690
rather than just looking them through

459
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:09,400
the lens of risk is breaking that out

460
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:12,370
into the dimension of how fast things

461
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,620
happen and see if that gives you some

462
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:16,419
more justification for doing some other

463
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:19,750
things or changing things a little bit

464
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:22,120
around the other thing that I think you

465
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,800
could use is the the risk matrix so if

466
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,820
you remember this it's effectively a

467
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:30,490
heatmap Bryton and what it's there for

468
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:32,649
is to try to get consistency in the way

469
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:35,260
you're training those things and you can

470
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:37,090
completely tailor your risk matrix for

471
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:39,640
your organisation it's it's a kind of

472
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:42,250
once one-shot deal you can't be doing

473
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,600
this dynamically bearing in mind risk

474
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,280
appetite is something that will change

475
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,310
over time and three different phases of

476
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,860
you of your business so to prove the

477
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:55,389
point that you can tailor a risk matrix

478
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:59,949
what I did was I put together some a

479
00:18:55,390 --> 00:19:01,720
high risk and I'm sorry there we go so

480
00:18:59,950 --> 00:19:03,730
high risk appetite low risk appetite

481
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:05,500
risk appetite goes up risk appetite goes

482
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:07,660
down risk appetite goes up mishap attack

483
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:09,100
go down so further prove my point I

484
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:14,620
invented a risk matrix for the

485
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:16,330
Australian psyche which kind of it's

486
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,560
being used in a lot of the top

487
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:20,139
organizations in Australia now I'm

488
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:27,909
pleased to say by contrast there's the

489
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:29,050
British one I asked my boss what he

490
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,340
thought about risk of assignment

491
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:31,659
statements because odds are if you're

492
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,860
thinking about risk appetite it may be

493
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,240
that the business has come to and said

494
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:36,010
hey we need a cyber risk appetite

495
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,060
statement and this is what he said off

496
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:39,910
the top of his head which I thought was

497
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:41,290
gold so I've included it here and it's a

498
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,280
sort of make-believe way of pretending

499
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,750
that you're saying an acceptable

500
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:47,560
threshold for how much risk you're

501
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:49,480
willing to take on and to prove that

502
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,299
point I went out and I searched for risk

503
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,639
appetite state

504
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:54,679
so you can you can google companies

505
00:19:52,639 --> 00:19:56,389
annual reports that often include these

506
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:59,209
things and had a look at some of them

507
00:19:56,389 --> 00:20:02,508
and what I found was that mostly they

508
00:19:59,209 --> 00:20:04,459
were generally just just PR fluff and

509
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:07,599
nonsense so the company will only

510
00:20:04,459 --> 00:20:09,739
tolerate low to moderate gross exposure

511
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:11,330
companies not willing to accept risk

512
00:20:09,739 --> 00:20:13,700
that compromise our ability to process

513
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:15,799
merchant transactions the bank has a

514
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,379
very low appetite for damage to bank and

515
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:21,529
when you actually read these and try and

516
00:20:18,379 --> 00:20:23,899
work out what they mean that it's just

517
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:25,759
PR statements that say we it's the same

518
00:20:23,899 --> 00:20:28,849
thing we have a really low appetite for

519
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:32,749
risk but that doesn't really mean you

520
00:20:28,849 --> 00:20:34,249
have a low appetite for risk if you get

521
00:20:32,749 --> 00:20:36,829
out to write a risk appetite statement

522
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:38,389
about cyber you can't say hey we're lip

523
00:20:36,829 --> 00:20:41,570
wing to root loose thirty percent of our

524
00:20:38,389 --> 00:20:44,178
data it's just not not a good look so

525
00:20:41,570 --> 00:20:49,129
just come up with some nice saying

526
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:52,399
motherhood statement that's my funny so

527
00:20:49,129 --> 00:20:53,928
key takeaways so understanding your risk

528
00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:55,008
appetite admitting you've got the

529
00:20:53,929 --> 00:20:56,029
problem is the first step towards

530
00:20:55,009 --> 00:20:58,489
modifying your behavior as an

531
00:20:56,029 --> 00:21:00,829
organization make sure it's it's in the

532
00:20:58,489 --> 00:21:02,509
sweet spot and it's equally important

533
00:21:00,829 --> 00:21:04,099
that it's something that's stable and

534
00:21:02,509 --> 00:21:05,389
consistent consider consistent ongoing

535
00:21:04,099 --> 00:21:08,178
consistency as much better than

536
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:09,998
perfection don't forget that they're not

537
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:12,229
necessarily static and change over time

538
00:21:09,999 --> 00:21:14,419
that's not what you think it is or what

539
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:16,070
you say is it's coded into the DNA of

540
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:18,499
what you do and the people you work with

541
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:21,769
do and more importantly what you choose

542
00:21:18,499 --> 00:21:24,919
not to do so you need to go and

543
00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:27,109
understand don't just parrot that what

544
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:29,179
the business is want to hear which is we

545
00:21:27,109 --> 00:21:30,468
have a low appetite for risk is go and

546
00:21:29,179 --> 00:21:31,969
look at the way you're treating the

547
00:21:30,469 --> 00:21:33,859
risks you have go and look at the things

548
00:21:31,969 --> 00:21:35,929
how they're being addressed how they're

549
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:38,439
being assessed how they've been

550
00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:41,839
contextualized across the business and

551
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,429
then look for higher order levers to

552
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:45,139
adjust them so not it's not about

553
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:47,119
applying security controls or dropping

554
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:48,559
in a firewall it's much higher up the

555
00:21:47,119 --> 00:21:50,958
stack it's at that money politics

556
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:55,099
religion layers eight nine and ten that

557
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:58,269
we control that and that's me I finished

558
00:21:55,099 --> 00:21:58,269
early questions

559
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:10,900
goodness no questions from anybody in

560
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:13,030
the room stunned silence that's one

561
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,140
that's why I'm stunned as well how long

562
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:22,540
did it take you to develop those risk

563
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:26,950
appetite matrices do you know my

564
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:30,280
question is about in your one of your

565
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:33,130
slides talked about what to recording

566
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:36,600
the risk register and what you should do

567
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:40,180
do something or good yeah the treatments

568
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:43,090
so my question was are you saying that

569
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:44,590
even for the ones that you don't let you

570
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:46,449
do something you don't put them in the

571
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,939
risk register because things change

572
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:51,090
controls may not be effective they

573
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:53,110
should still be in the risk register -

574
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:54,879
yeah I'm not saying don't put things in

575
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:57,639
the risk register but what I'm saying is

576
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,470
don't use your risk register as a place

577
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:05,080
to park risks or to sweep them under the

578
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:08,160
carpet you know so I've seen the I guess

579
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:11,710
what I see is when you start having

580
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:14,500
things in place that get measured that

581
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:16,750
over time what happens is you stop you

582
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,520
stop measuring the management of those

583
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:24,490
things and start managing the many the

584
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:26,410
measurement of those things so I had a

585
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:28,570
customer once where I gave them a risk

586
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:29,950
assessment and they came back to me and

587
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:31,689
said hey you've given us a medium risk

588
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,400
for this can we swap that medium for two

589
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:34,570
lows because if it's a medium we have to

590
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,310
escalate it and that's really awkward

591
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:39,220
for us can you break it down into

592
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:40,659
smaller components the other thing I saw

593
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:44,650
happen which I thought was particularly

594
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:45,970
smart was raise it as a project risk and

595
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:48,910
then when the project gets closed down

596
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:51,070
it goes away so this all this kind of

597
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:53,230
horse trading and all these underhand

598
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:55,600
tactics for managing those risk and what

599
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:58,740
they equate to is an increased risk

600
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:01,000
appetite because there isn't that

601
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,740
consistency you've got people you know

602
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,600
sometimes you have people lower down in

603
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:09,250
organization that are accepting risks

604
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:11,110
that actually a way beyond their pay

605
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,720
grade so you might have someone decide

606
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:15,090
that their project risk is fine

607
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,909
their project they can accept it but

608
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:19,620
when bad things happen customers who

609
00:24:17,909 --> 00:24:21,179
have their data appear on pastebin don't

610
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,530
necessarily understand that it was a

611
00:24:21,179 --> 00:24:25,610
project risks rather than a business

612
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:28,080
risk and they come blame the business so

613
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:30,350
yeah I'm not saying don't put 7 the rest

614
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:34,199
registers but don't use registered as a

615
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:35,639
you know a waiter just do nothing so

616
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:37,500
does that mean don't follow the masses

617
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,450
and be as sheeple and actually just do

618
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:41,520
what everybody else does try and uplift

619
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:47,010
your environment actually do real

620
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:50,250
security yeah much in that I'm just

621
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:52,970
wondering as I'm sitting here often when

622
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:55,500
I look at my organization they have

623
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:57,630
organizational risk appetite which they

624
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:00,690
haven't really figured out yet and I'm

625
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:04,110
sitting here thinking today with who you

626
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:06,299
speak on cyber risk appetite it kind of

627
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:08,760
follows makes sense to me that we've got

628
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:11,610
risk appetite for our financial office

629
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:13,080
we've got risk appetite for our whatever

630
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,699
widgets were making we've got risk

631
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:17,460
appetite for everything we're actually

632
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:20,059
doing so what are your thoughts on that

633
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:22,799
is that a good way to look at things or

634
00:25:20,059 --> 00:25:24,690
absolutely but the the difficulty is

635
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,549
that those parts of the business come to

636
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:28,740
you and say can you give us a risk

637
00:25:26,549 --> 00:25:31,620
appetite statement that cyber that fits

638
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:34,230
nicely in line with our risk appetites

639
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:36,719
across the rest of the business and it's

640
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:38,880
much harder for us to put dollar values

641
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,470
on things because we don't have the data

642
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,000
because every organization is different

643
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:44,250
because everything's subjective

644
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,429
everything's nuanced so it's almost

645
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:49,440
folly to waste cycles trying to come up

646
00:25:47,429 --> 00:25:51,659
with a dollar value when the reality is

647
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,820
you could spend months doing it and you

648
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:56,070
could get in a top four consulting

649
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:59,879
company to run Monte Carlo and the

650
00:25:56,070 --> 00:26:03,240
output is in my view fiction or highly

651
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:05,400
likely to be fictional so that was what

652
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,620
I was trying to I'm trying to square

653
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,750
that circle and normally when I do a

654
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:11,189
talk I come up with a problem or a bit

655
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:12,539
of a rant about something and I have a

656
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,890
bunch of things that I here's what I

657
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:16,590
think is the answer let's have a

658
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:17,760
discussion and this this when I said

659
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:19,260
this has been an interesting journey

660
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,120
it's because as I got towards the end of

661
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:24,270
my talk I thought look I kind of think I

662
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,649
understand this stuff but I don't know

663
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:26,370
what the you know truth is I don't know

664
00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:27,629
what the

665
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:30,870
what I'm advocating here or what the

666
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:32,820
answer is what I am saying is don't go

667
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:34,860
and spend fortune trying to come up with

668
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:36,809
a dollar value if you can have a

669
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:38,309
reasonable you can have some confidence

670
00:26:36,809 --> 00:26:39,750
from the outset that whatever number you

671
00:26:38,309 --> 00:26:42,690
come up with it's going to be

672
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:44,220
meaningless if that makes sense it's an

673
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:45,480
awkward position for me to be in because

674
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,910
I'd like to be able to say hey here's a

675
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,210
really nice way to do it but it ended up

676
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:53,309
as a joke about the 12 days of Christmas

677
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:54,809
it really seems to me like you need to

678
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:56,970
consider if you come across these

679
00:26:54,809 --> 00:26:58,710
situations recommending implementation

680
00:26:56,970 --> 00:27:00,990
of something like saps are all some of

681
00:26:58,710 --> 00:27:03,120
the other architectures that actually

682
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:06,210
consider real risk and actually the

683
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,500
needs and and requirements of the

684
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:10,320
business based on the business

685
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:12,750
objectives which will actually pull out

686
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,610
all of these other business risks sub

687
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,929
organizational risks into inter

688
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:17,520
operational and necessities between

689
00:27:15,929 --> 00:27:20,070
different parts of the business who's

690
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,600
the real risk owner for this component

691
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,919
of this component because risk owners a

692
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,649
really important thing to actually

693
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:27,059
understand the many businesses think

694
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:29,309
author sizess is on the risk owner for

695
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:31,440
that but in reality it could be the CFO

696
00:27:29,309 --> 00:27:33,240
it could actually be the CEO because

697
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,130
there's there's too many people at a

698
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,929
slightly lower level that all believe

699
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:38,640
we'll all have some hand in the risk of

700
00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:41,670
the ocean for that particular risk yeah

701
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:45,870
for sure if you read about risk appetite

702
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:47,580
it is that conveying said it's setting

703
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:50,189
in appetite and conveying it through the

704
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:51,990
business and sewing it through the DNA

705
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:54,600
of the organization so that everybody's

706
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:56,790
on board everyone's in line and it's not

707
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,320
an inherent risk appetite it's something

708
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:01,740
you've actually prescribed for the

709
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,350
business and risk is a good thing for

710
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,030
some businesses so so there is a

711
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:08,699
propensity in cybersecurity to try to

712
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:10,830
eliminate risk completely and the danger

713
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:12,390
then is you it's a drag coefficient on

714
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:13,919
your business because your your presents

715
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:15,390
to your husband's like itself yet as the

716
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,160
risk of Lunetta completely means you're

717
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:18,630
actually putting a great risk on the

718
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,980
financial means of the organization and

719
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:21,330
the organization may go under by

720
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:23,160
overspending in this area rather than

721
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:24,330
another area yeah yeah one of the ideas

722
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,790
I had when I was working on this talk

723
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:29,070
was to as a bit of a gift for all the

724
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:30,570
people who've been attended was to come

725
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:32,399
up with some risks that I could give you

726
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:34,790
about the risks of not having a

727
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:37,950
appropriate risk appetite in cyber and

728
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:40,230
what the likelihood and the consequence

729
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:41,730
of that would be but I just ended up

730
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:43,110
feeling us a little bit unfair to have

731
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:44,669
you all woke away with three more risk

732
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:46,168
for a risk for your refrigerator and it

733
00:28:44,669 --> 00:28:48,480
also became a little bit meta and a

734
00:28:46,169 --> 00:28:50,870
little bit inception this entire

735
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,610
subjects basis can be very meta and

736
00:28:50,870 --> 00:28:54,479
unpacked on the reveled we've still got

737
00:28:53,610 --> 00:29:02,790
plenty of time if there's any other

738
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:04,830
questions thanks for your talk the

739
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:06,780
question is oh it's more of a yeah it's

740
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:09,389
a question if you had me thoughts about

741
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:12,720
risk accountability you sort of touched

742
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:14,730
on risk owners then and to me that can

743
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,320
be really challenging to figure out who

744
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:19,260
actually is the risk owner and who's

745
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:23,100
accountable for this risk because the

746
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:24,840
nice idea is someone will be accountable

747
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,459
for this and then they'll take action on

748
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,449
it yeah but it can be a little bit more

749
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:32,309
challenging in practice at the end of

750
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:35,460
the day accountability lies with the

751
00:29:32,309 --> 00:29:38,520
risk and the risk owner may delegate

752
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:40,440
operational components that risk but you

753
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,340
tell me to do this for you you're

754
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,540
responsible make sure it actually

755
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,668
happened or at least it meets your

756
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:47,490
requirements you may engage a third

757
00:29:44,669 --> 00:29:50,250
party to audit that or we might have an

758
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:53,250
SLA whereby if I fail you can you can

759
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:54,059
bill me for it you can sue me for it but

760
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,770
at the end of that you're still

761
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:58,470
accountable it's your business risk it's

762
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:59,700
your department's operational risk

763
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:02,040
ownership very even though you might

764
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:04,410
outsource the IT department or some

765
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:05,940
specialist app development group that's

766
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:08,250
that's not that's my understanding of

767
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,809
that particular scenario yeah well to me

768
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:12,660
it's having spent some time researching

769
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:14,700
what happens after a breach its who has

770
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:16,200
skin in the game who's gonna get you

771
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:19,280
know it's going to end up driving over

772
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:22,080
after this all comes out in the press

773
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:25,049
and and how do people behave as a result

774
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:27,389
of that hanging over them and is that

775
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:28,530
good for your risk appetite or bad but

776
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:30,240
the best thing to actually understand

777
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:31,799
where there belongs before you actually

778
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,669
have that burrito as you're after yeah

779
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:34,668
that's the secret

780
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:38,940
so yeah the cost of the cost of a breach

781
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:44,720
you don't have is a lot cheaper than the

782
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:49,140
ones you do oh dear yes still what role

783
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:50,850
now this one Eric I mean the the risk

784
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:53,250
owner is the one who ends up driving

785
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:55,379
uber at the end of it as you say when

786
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:57,870
they get sacked but surely all risk is

787
00:30:55,380 --> 00:31:00,660
the board's ultimate responsibility and

788
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:03,928
that guy driving uber is just the

789
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:07,230
scapegoat so how do you stop that

790
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:08,640
yes defense without position defensible

791
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:13,530
position for the things you do choose

792
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:14,970
not to do you know the reality is it's

793
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:16,020
it's difficult to avoid if you're in

794
00:31:14,970 --> 00:31:19,530
that position and you're going to be

795
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:20,820
made a scapegoat of you you might want

796
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:22,320
to think about that when you take those

797
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,850
types of roles or when you negotiate the

798
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,879
package for those types of roles if it's

799
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:28,678
that type of company organization what I

800
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,000
saw when I did research into that is

801
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:32,250
that even though there was a propensity

802
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:36,660
for big companies to fire people after

803
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:39,179
the fact that in itself didn't help the

804
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:40,890
share price in fact in many cases share

805
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:45,150
price continues to drop after those

806
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:48,510
people are sacrificed which might mean

807
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:49,770
that as we get more maturity in this

808
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:51,419
space which is something that's

809
00:31:49,770 --> 00:31:53,580
happening organically you're less likely

810
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:57,000
just to be thrown under the bus when

811
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:59,340
that happens and and and we're all on

812
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,350
this big maturity journey the u.s. is

813
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:03,240
way ahead of everyone else because

814
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:05,580
sarbanes-oxley has meant that they have

815
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,950
lots more CISOs and lots more season you

816
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:09,809
know the first generation of Caesars

817
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:11,309
literally were told come and stand by

818
00:32:09,809 --> 00:32:13,918
this altar put on this robe and don't

819
00:32:11,309 --> 00:32:16,500
touch anything now we're actually

820
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:18,809
getting people who are empowered to make

821
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:22,049
changes and do things and and are now

822
00:32:18,809 --> 00:32:24,240
able to understand these things but I

823
00:32:22,049 --> 00:32:26,668
maintained that a lot of the rhetoric in

824
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,080
cyber is the board doesn't understand

825
00:32:26,669 --> 00:32:31,260
site but we need to get people on the

826
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,389
board who understand cybersecurity and

827
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:34,650
I've been saying all along actually you

828
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:36,059
need to get people in cyber who

829
00:32:34,650 --> 00:32:38,250
understand the board and understand the

830
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:40,260
business because you know in our allergy

831
00:32:38,250 --> 00:32:41,730
I'm fond of is if you imagine a cyber

832
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,860
security guy in a hospital running

833
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:44,820
around going hey we've got

834
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:47,790
vulnerabilities on the servers this is

835
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:48,750
really bad where is the risk officers

836
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:51,059
running around going hey we've got

837
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:52,440
bestest in the children's ward you know

838
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:55,230
so which one is going to play out worse

839
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,730
in the media so in the in the context

840
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:58,110
actually go on and fix that before you

841
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:59,880
worry about the service

842
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:01,949
and that's what's hard for people in

843
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:04,529
cyber sometimes because we are a bit

844
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:06,269
blinkered well this is translating that

845
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:07,470
risk into what the realized implication

846
00:33:06,269 --> 00:33:09,390
is going to be and actually speaking at

847
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:10,740
the board level yeah I was going to

848
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:14,700
Rick's back to your point before about

849
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:17,250
size OHS 9 times out of 10 when there's

850
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:19,169
a massive issue a massive breach and the

851
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:21,149
size o could actually be thrown under

852
00:33:19,169 --> 00:33:22,409
the bus as the scapegoat it's actually

853
00:33:21,149 --> 00:33:23,580
worse the organization because they're

854
00:33:22,409 --> 00:33:25,769
the people with the actual knowledge

855
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,970
they've learned from this issue that

856
00:33:25,769 --> 00:33:28,679
actually then performed better in the

857
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:30,179
organization and you might actually find

858
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:32,070
that the issue was actually further

859
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:33,899
upstream you know lack of management

860
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:37,110
understanding and down in Australia

861
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:41,610
remember when the dot after the.com

862
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:44,580
bubble burst people who'd started

863
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:47,428
startups that had failed were a hot

864
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:49,559
commodity because people were mature and

865
00:33:47,429 --> 00:33:51,899
us had realized there was a lot to be

866
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:52,860
learned from the people who'd failed you

867
00:33:51,899 --> 00:33:55,529
know what doesn't kill you makes you

868
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:59,908
stronger and maybe that's a maybe that's

869
00:33:55,529 --> 00:34:01,200
the next evolution for CEOs is is that

870
00:33:59,909 --> 00:34:03,389
actually people that have been sacked

871
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,490
actually then become instantly

872
00:34:03,389 --> 00:34:06,029
employable because they you know lessons

873
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:08,820
learned

874
00:34:06,029 --> 00:34:12,089
who knows we'd all rather not fail fast

875
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:19,020
fail early but if we do fail fast fail

876
00:34:12,089 --> 00:34:20,339
early maybe we improve oh well if we

877
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:22,409
have no further questions could

878
00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:25,909
everybody young please thank Eric thank

879
00:34:22,409 --> 00:34:25,909
you very provoking talk
