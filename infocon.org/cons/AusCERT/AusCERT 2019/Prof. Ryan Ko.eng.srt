1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:09,059
can you please help me welcome Ryan to

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:11,190
start thank you right so I'm Ryan ko I'm

3
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:13,799
the director of the UQ cybersecurity

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:16,800
initiative which we have introduced at

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:19,198
the opening now today I guess it's gonna

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,449
be a few parts of this like half an hour

7
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,510
that we're gonna do but if the first

8
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:26,670
part is to basically to introduce to you

9
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:29,460
what we are planning to do the second

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:31,289
part is to hear about whether you know

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:34,440
from you so it's kind of interactive

12
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:37,230
towards the two-thirds part of the the

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,050
session you know you can you can throw

14
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,519
eggs so you know you know or tomatoes or

15
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:43,410
something just give us feedback you'll

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,510
be great we want to learn and we want to

17
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:48,809
validate what we're doing so that we

18
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:51,239
give the best value for the you know

19
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:54,809
Queensland and society and the nation

20
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:56,070
and and then finally the most exciting

21
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:59,489
part would probably be the draw the

22
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,870
lucky deep draw so if you if you if you

23
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:04,739
still want to participate in that you

24
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:06,689
can you know just indicate your hand up

25
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:09,619

just a quick poll just want to see if

45
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:53,470
there's any UQ alumni here Wow cool and

46
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:55,930
current UQ members yeah yeah okay

47
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:57,490
it's nice thank you and how many of you

48
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,570
are from the government I asked this

49
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:00,280
question before why I just want to

50
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,720
understand a little bit more at this

51
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,860
crowd because this you're the ones who

52
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,790
actually made the effort to come thank

53
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,890
you yeah

54
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,820
and and I'm sure that's there must be

55
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:08,709
something you want to get out of this

56
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,329
session right so the government can you

57
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:12,690
raise your hand again so that people

58
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:15,370
from the industry can also see you and

59
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:19,660
Industry yeah

60
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:25,600
and universities yeah Wow Wow it's quite

61
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:27,730
a lot yeah and TAFE TAFE colleges yep

62
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:31,470
cool yeah we actually going to work with

63
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:36,970
the TAFE Queensland as well artists I

64
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:43,870
may have missed out you know spooks yeah

65
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:46,180
I know where you from anyone yeah so so

66
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:49,480
another question is this who hires the

67
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:53,530
cyber security professionals yeah okay a

68
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:55,500
few of you right so it's kind of an

69
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:59,770
interactive slider I want to ask you

70
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:04,330
what are the common challenges you face

71
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:06,910
for each hiring process yeah David do

72
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:09,370
you want to honor you know give her two

73
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:11,970
cents yeah obviously the caliber of

74
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:14,290
people caliber of people yeah and the

75
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:15,850
and there's a huge demand we can see

76
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,260
that growing so we're also refreshing

77
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:19,899
not only just to in recruiting but

78
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,159
actually retaining as well yeah I think

79
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:22,900
I think this is two elements to it

80
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,940
recruiting and retaining and retaining

81
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:27,489
and then somebody leave for like a

82
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:31,719
$1,000,000 your job or something yeah

83
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:33,220
that doesn't come to me but it is based

84
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,720
on the true story yeah I've heard of

85
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,550
happening with you but certainly for our

86
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,200
analysts and we had a lot of effort into

87
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,150
the training of their armor so the very

88
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,729
high value

89
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:43,229
Calvin yeah yeah attracting and

90
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:44,810
retaining yeah any others

91
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:46,530
I'd say sorting the wheat from the chaff

92
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,180
sorting the wheat from the chaff and

93
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,559
also expecially getting people to even

94
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:55,050
apply here I was actually offered a

95
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:56,280
common problem yep it's just getting

96
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,440
someone who's a little bit more

97
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,710
developed than technical and I think

98
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,600
that some people even tend to Greg

99
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:05,900
gravitate towards it and go yeah I can

100
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,880
really use my technical chops here but

101
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:11,909
government we have selection criterias

102
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,719
for jobs and those things may even have

103
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:18,240
at an entry level four or five and one

104
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:20,600
of them is technical right um one of my

105
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,080
APS colleagues earlier in the conference

106
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:27,630
she got a great analyst in straight out

107
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,740
of uni one year later Telstra poached

108
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:33,240
him for forty thousand more a year then

109
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:36,060
and there's always that challenge

110
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,940
retention is hard and you want to get

111
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:42,600
people maybe got a little bit more of an

112
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:45,060
ethos about serving the public and there

113
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,220
are as opposed to just collecting the

114
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,349
dosh though we wish them well and when

115
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,440
they go and hope that they make a matzah

116
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:55,440
maybe thank you

117
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,630
well any others want to talk about the

118
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,599
challenges so sounds like retaining and

119
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:01,740
attracting and retaining especially it

120
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:03,510
seems to be more challenging than

121
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:05,849
attracting yeah being able to afford

122
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:07,590
them afford them yeah simple yeah in

123
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:09,659
bright label we're finding in Sydney six

124
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,429
figures yeah yeah for a junior straight

125
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:15,090
out of university that's right there's a

126
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:16,830
like precious commodities now yeah I was

127
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:19,679
just gonna say that you really need

128
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:22,109
people who have a very broad range of

129
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,150
kind of skills like we gets very ripped

130
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:28,470
well-rounded individuals and they're

131
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:31,948
quite rare yeah okay thank you and what

132
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:34,080
type of jobs do you recruit for missus

133
00:06:31,949 --> 00:06:36,090
another one so to answers because I just

134
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,070
want to have a flavor about anyone well

135
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:41,630
he hasn't spoken just now but hiring

136
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:41,630
people and once you speak

137
00:06:44,340 --> 00:07:05,460
so I both tech inside both Sherman's yep

138
00:06:47,480 --> 00:07:06,650
yep okay and operations in architecture

139
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,570
okay yeah

140
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:17,099
the challenge is there anyone talking

141
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:21,120
about cyber insurance GRC research yep

142
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:25,070
okay yeah R&D before offensive

143
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,070
background yeah you see so that's the

144
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:32,310
that's a challenge to us yes yeah thank

145
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:35,790
you

146
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:38,670
and the other thing is the other

147
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:40,680
spectrum of the the supply chain of jobs

148
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:43,830
right so the CEO do you think that your

149
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,050
HR advertised the jobs properly so for

150
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,419
example you won a fresh graduate with

151
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:51,810
five years experience and the CISSP and

152
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:55,010
the CISM and maybe even crest with a

153
00:07:51,810 --> 00:08:02,220
little bit of sense is the to experience

154
00:07:55,010 --> 00:08:04,680
yeah no one no one agree yeah yeah yeah

155
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:06,900
right so this is one of the challenges

156
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,210
and actually in the in the United States

157
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:11,880
they have this framework called a nice

158
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:13,739
framework which which are trying to

159
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:15,480
address some of these challenges I think

160
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,280
in Australia is good that we can come

161
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,470
together and maybe we can start to lobby

162
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,969
for something like that not reinventing

163
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:22,940
what they've done but adapting what

164
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:26,520
they've done to the Australian economy

165
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:27,960
and what is the biggest worry right as a

166
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,270
member of the so this is the final

167
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:33,659
question before you know I go on and

168
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:37,460
talk so what is the biggest worry right

169
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:37,459
now anyone just one one

170
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:46,360
from a like government point of view is

171
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:49,810
very important to do a work-life balance

172
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:50,260
and our security guys their work to the

173
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:54,849
bone

174
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:56,980
yeah my private sector had no idea but I

175
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:58,330
know for the government it's the work to

176
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,060
the bone and they're always in big

177
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:02,800
demand and it's hard for to get other

178
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,180
security people involved in that area

179
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,650
because there's no one there

180
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,390
they've already been poached in their

181
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:09,490
private sectors and I'm quite surprised

182
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:11,500
that our guys are still actually working

183
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:14,020
for the government but the reason why

184
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:16,900
they are is because they can still work

185
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,189
and do home life as well and you're a

186
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,430
great leader that's why I want to stay

187
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,990
with you I wish I was here grandpa yeah

188
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:27,810
so that sounds like appropriate

189
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:27,810
resourcing yeah resourcing yeah resource

190
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,950
for me it's it's the legal risk it has

191
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,000
working in this industry yeah when we

192
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:36,490
have a government that isn't protecting

193
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,010
whistleblowers right now a lot of this

194
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:40,570
these actions can be especially when

195
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:42,670
talking about the offensive actors

196
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:44,080
that's right how do you become an

197
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:48,310
offensive actor without being seen as a

198
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:49,780
threat yeah we understand that and in

199
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:52,660
fact at the University of Queensland

200
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:54,910
recently we because we have a few

201
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,740
batches of new PhD students so we are

202
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,810
starting to consider the ethical

203
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:01,570
approval routes and we were doing that

204
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:03,310
right and looking at it the classical

205
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:06,340
ethical approval routes they usually

206
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:09,280
talk about DNA and genomics and you know

207
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:12,250
our private data from a biological point

208
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,870
of view but we would like to see how we

209
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:16,180
can actually improve our you know how

210
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:17,380
even our internal processes on on doing

211
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:20,620
such a thing so that we protect people

212
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:22,930
who do the research and you know if they

213
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:25,390
do it legally of course you know and and

214
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:28,270
also you know how can we encourage more

215
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:31,150
open research so I'm just gonna do a

216
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:34,420
quick overview of the Australian

217
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:36,550
landscape as summarized by our cyber so

218
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,380
they say that actually it's it's quite

219
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:41,079
large you know we have about 19 thousand

220
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:43,360
five hundred cyber security

221
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:46,660
professionals in Australia and many of

222
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,580
you are here today and across a wide

223
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,680
range of different jobs and using the

224
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:53,440
nice framework they they they categorize

225
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,219
people into seven categories you know

226
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,760
ranging from

227
00:10:54,220 --> 00:11:02,170
investigations which is about 2% you

228
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:05,200
know doing forensics doing attribution

229
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:07,329
and so on and all the way to to

230
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,510
maintenance of the IT security systems

231
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:11,980
about 21% well close to one quarter and

232
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:14,520
a growing number of these rows are

233
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:17,490
non-technical and require

234
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:21,960
multidisciplinary skills from from law

235
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:24,940
communications and psychology right and

236
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:27,970
but it's not all doom and gloom you know

237
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:30,190
so so the but the challenge is quite

238
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:32,620
real and it's more severe than then

239
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:34,240
previously thought all of you are

240
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:36,310
probably I'm probably preaching to the

241
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,050
choir here because you would know about

242
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:40,270
this thing about you know shortage and

243
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:42,520
all so on and so forth but what is

244
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:44,800
interesting is that you know this number

245
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:48,130
here that they are talking about so I

246
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:50,050
think every University TAFE even

247
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:52,470
training institutions or private

248
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:54,609
entities all have to work together to

249
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,290
actually make this happen you know so

250
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:58,150
it's great to see all the different the

251
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:03,640
spectrum of people providing the

252
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:05,290
training here and apparently that's good

253
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:09,120
news you know the education system is

254
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:11,550
responding effectively more than half of

255
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,110
Australia's universities actually offer

256
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:17,620
cyber security qualifications and many

257
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:19,810
others teach some courses there's also

258
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:22,990
TAFE colleges around with a standardized

259
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:24,790
program and you know they they're there

260
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,580
the numbers are increasing and we have

261
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:29,709
seen that all over Australia however

262
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:32,710
there's some risks which will slow down

263
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:34,480
the mobilisation such as they as you

264
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:36,880
rightly say just now because I want to

265
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,910
see if this is our strength test what

266
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,530
they say you know and is it true if what

267
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:42,699
is on the ground right so so this is

268
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,350
right you know they're they're

269
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:48,120
struggling to compete with the private

270
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:50,890
sector and retain the teaching staff and

271
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:53,500
you know new cybersecurity courses

272
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:55,449
should be industry focused and include

273
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:57,430
opportunities for work integrated

274
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:01,060
learning so how do you make sure that

275
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:03,609
when they join you they you know they're

276
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:06,219
a University grad who knows how to do

277
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:08,019
the work as well right and to truly

278
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:10,959
prepare them for the jobs

279
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:13,269
so if this risks are addressed then the

280
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:17,979
long-term outlook is quite encouraging

281
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:20,529
so we are just doing kind of a single

282
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,509
response and it is my encouragement to

283
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:25,329
you if you know if you are from other

284
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:27,850
universities today that we could talk

285
00:13:25,329 --> 00:13:29,559
about how we respond together and work

286
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,600
together so there might be some courses

287
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:32,920
that you teach that we can and there are

288
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,110
some courses that we teach that you can

289
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:37,479
so so it's good to work together ok so

290
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:39,639
this is our response it's just an

291
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,529
example it's not a prescription but

292
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:44,559
hopefully it can inspire more people to

293
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:48,639
do that so you've seen these slides

294
00:13:44,559 --> 00:13:51,249
before but the gist of this slide is the

295
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:53,319
availability of real life datasets and

296
00:13:51,249 --> 00:13:56,110
real life mentors from author and its

297
00:13:53,319 --> 00:13:57,459
members and the IITs team and also our

298
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:59,649
partners you know from around the world

299
00:13:57,459 --> 00:14:01,420
which I'll show you later a glimpse of

300
00:13:59,649 --> 00:14:04,749
the example of some of the partners that

301
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:06,519
we have and the the center one which is

302
00:14:04,749 --> 00:14:08,889
quite yet attractive one which is the

303
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:11,439
interdisciplinary aspects of things and

304
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:12,730
then delivering in different forms one

305
00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:18,399
of them is the master of cybersecurity

306
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:20,709
which I'll use as an example so we have

307
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,319
a history at UQ and you all know the

308
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:24,599
history establishing in 1992 we

309
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:28,540
Fawcett's

310
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,670
establishment and you know we have kind

311
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:33,099
of a benchmark there you know because we

312
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:36,429
are the second set after CMU Carnegie

313
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:38,199
Mellon it is our aspiration to within

314
00:14:36,429 --> 00:14:40,209
the next few years you know at least to

315
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:42,389
have the structure and the programs that

316
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:46,299
will match Carnegie Mellon's type of

317
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:50,679
offerings and value to the to the wider

318
00:14:46,299 --> 00:14:53,410
society so we launched a series of

319
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:56,230
different so we have about 40 academics

320
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:59,259
from around the university and a

321
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:01,209
partners at Jung and full-time and

322
00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:03,369
together with our partners we want to

323
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:04,628
develop the the top graduates and the

324
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:10,119
industry leaders in the cybersecurity

325
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:13,209
sector some of the research that we do

326
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:16,419
are quite varied so I'm quite new to UQ

327
00:15:13,209 --> 00:15:17,979
I've only joined in February and in the

328
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:19,839
first three months I made an effort to

329
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,410
walk around the campus so my steps on my

330
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,779
mobile phone or

331
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:26,810
very high right and I think I lost maybe

332
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:28,819
10 kg you know but but it's good it's

333
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:30,800
good walking you know we we managed to

334
00:15:28,819 --> 00:15:32,899
find out the the variety of things that

335
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,449
people are actually doing there are in

336
00:15:32,899 --> 00:15:37,550
cyber or related to cyber for example

337
00:15:35,449 --> 00:15:39,979
the quantum communications so we have a

338
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:42,979
group which talks about the quantum key

339
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:44,899
distribution and also some of the people

340
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:49,069
who are trying to find out ways to make

341
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:51,620
a general quantum computer more possible

342
00:15:49,069 --> 00:15:52,910
right so let's do some time away from

343
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,589
some of them but a quantum key

344
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:56,120
distribution you know for example the

345
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:58,509
likes of quintessence in the end you

346
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:01,209
have shown that it is possible and

347
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:03,290
you're trying to find out ways to even

348
00:16:01,209 --> 00:16:05,119
optimize things like you know when you

349
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:07,339
do it from a satellite now all the way

350
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,899
to earth and how do you actually

351
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:10,579
modulate them and how do you make sure

352
00:16:08,899 --> 00:16:12,620
that a signal actually works properly

353
00:16:10,579 --> 00:16:16,550
you know these are the basic things that

354
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:18,529
that are quite cutting-edge but we need

355
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:20,300
them right so some sometimes

356
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:22,670
universities get to stick for you know

357
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,870
oh you know you don't train but there's

358
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,029
a lot of very interesting things that

359
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:29,089
came up from the University RSA for

360
00:16:26,029 --> 00:16:31,189
example we've got the CAPTCHA capture

361
00:16:29,089 --> 00:16:34,610
was also a university kind of effort and

362
00:16:31,189 --> 00:16:36,290
so on and so forth so we we cover a few

363
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:38,569
other aspects as well I'm not going to

364
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:40,130
read all of them but you could see that

365
00:16:38,569 --> 00:16:42,769
on the other side of the spectrum right

366
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:45,019
from the very technical parts all the

367
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:46,970
way to the policy and the criminology

368
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:50,600
part so one of the trends that we see

369
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:52,819
also right now is that for example when

370
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,920
when when a person so this is in my

371
00:16:52,819 --> 00:16:56,540
previous role and in the interaction

372
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,910
with the frontline police officers and

373
00:16:56,540 --> 00:17:01,069
with the Interpol we found that a lot of

374
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:03,500
the frontline officers are not equipped

375
00:17:01,069 --> 00:17:05,899
with the knowledge and the technical

376
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,659
expertise to handle cases like

377
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:11,839
ransomware attacks so a granny could

378
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:14,120
come with a lot laptop to the police

379
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,129
station and they get turn away because

380
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:18,678
the police officer doesn't know what to

381
00:17:16,130 --> 00:17:19,850
do you know they said ah we can't help

382
00:17:18,679 --> 00:17:24,100
you you know you can look for your

383
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:24,099
nearest IT guys or you can cause cause

384
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:30,140
yeah right so so this is this is the

385
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,600
reality so the spectrum of what we we

386
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:34,970
have here are the challenges is quite

387
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:39,469
large it can be full of

388
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:40,820
full program by itself right and what we

389
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:43,270
try to do is we are trying to partner

390
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,710
with the the government agencies

391
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:48,500
industry partners so these are some of

392
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:50,510
the samples of the researchers that I've

393
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:53,000
talked to and including myself you know

394
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:55,280
who are we partnering with we are also

395
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,610
partnering with the likes of you know

396
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,710
NATO in the pol I so we have oracle left

397
00:17:58,610 --> 00:18:04,219
yes in Brisbane you know Palo Alto

398
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:08,690
Networks alone NIST will be a key

399
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:10,400
partner of us as well and we we're based

400
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:12,980
in the Asia Pacific or in the

401
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,080
indo-pacific region so it is good to

402
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:17,390
have friends all around so working with

403
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:20,449
AP nake and you know all the certs

404
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:24,470
around the Pacific nations Singapore

405
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:27,020
Japan and Korea we are we are attempting

406
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:30,350
to create kind of like a very strong

407
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:33,460
force of very technically sound people

408
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:37,219
and also very strong multidisciplinary

409
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:38,929
people as well and we're tied to some of

410
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:40,220
the centres of excellence so we get

411
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:42,200
access to some of the cutting-edge

412
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:44,900
equipment so I was just having a chat

413
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:46,130
with Silvio yesterday about you know

414
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,370
some of the things that he was to do on

415
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:51,110
the hardware and and then he was talking

416
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:52,639
about equipment and my head of school

417
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:54,408
was just next to me and he said oh we

418
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,299
have those equipment you know why don't

419
00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:58,429
you come and just try them I was like

420
00:18:56,299 --> 00:19:00,830
okay yeah so this is the beauty of the

421
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:04,159
you know those kind of interdisciplinary

422
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:05,840
work that we do and the energy sector of

423
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:08,630
course and critical infrastructure and

424
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:13,970
of course more than 400 copper members

425
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:17,299
of the now hitting 500 yeah yep so we're

426
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:19,720
gonna do it in a few ways undergraduate

427
00:19:17,299 --> 00:19:22,250
degrees postgraduate degrees and so on

428
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:24,320
but I think I'm gonna zoom into one

429
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,309
which is the our proposed master of

430
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,610
cybersecurity

431
00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:30,408
which is kind of the nice framework

432
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:36,010
aligned so what what we're trying to do

433
00:19:30,409 --> 00:19:39,470
is we're trying to create three tiers

434
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:41,929
the first here right so imagine so this

435
00:19:39,470 --> 00:19:44,929
is kind of like a model after the Mary

436
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:48,890
Medical School or the engineering school

437
00:19:44,929 --> 00:19:53,270
or the business school right so you come

438
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:55,040
you come in with a common core

439
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:58,129
regardless of your background so as long

440
00:19:55,040 --> 00:20:00,260
as you have a bachelor's degree you know

441
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:02,570
you can have a degree in music III did

442
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:05,030
heven an alumni with a degree in music

443
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:06,350
and he became the best student in the

444
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:09,430
master of cybersecurity which I was

445
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:11,659
running so it's definitely possible

446
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:13,550
about you come in here and you learn

447
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,990
from your friends and you start to sit

448
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:17,300
next to the guy who had a law background

449
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:18,740
and you make you make friends right you

450
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,809
make a cohort it's kind of like your

451
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:24,110
high school students coming together

452
00:20:20,809 --> 00:20:25,700
again right and and then we branch into

453
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:27,909
specializations different

454
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:29,809
specializations the cyber defense

455
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:31,880
specializations the leadership

456
00:20:29,809 --> 00:20:34,460
specializations cybercrime

457
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:37,640
specializations and the cryptography

458
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:41,210
specialization in these specializations

459
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:43,190
if you have the background you will keep

460
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:46,850
some of the courses you know for example

461
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:48,200
basics of data databases and so on or if

462
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:51,230
you don't have the background you go

463
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,120
through some of those right and for

464
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:56,690
example in cryptography if you have done

465
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,669
things like linear algebra discrete math

466
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,890
that we would put you through the

467
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:02,480
torture again you go straight into our

468
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:04,460
quantum computing and technologies

469
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,380
courses you go into our applied

470
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:10,280
cryptography causes and so on and so

471
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:12,650
forth right so in in a nutshell this is

472
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:14,720
where you start to build your muscles

473
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:17,120
right be your muscles and then after

474
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,720
that we send you out you know down the

475
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:23,479
mountain into into the real world with

476
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:26,780
with a capstone project so if you are an

477
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:30,230
existing employee of a company studying

478
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:32,840
this part-time then you can use your

479
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:35,630
existing companies cyber security needs

480
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:39,050
and research needs to be a part of your

481
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:41,390
capstone research project if you don't

482
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:43,820
have an existing job then we will have

483
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:46,160
the employability team assisting you to

484
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:49,010
form internships with a list of

485
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:53,179
companies for example our members and

486
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:55,879
our IDs teams and you know and beyond it

487
00:21:53,179 --> 00:22:00,740
is my plan to start internships with

488
00:21:55,880 --> 00:22:02,600
global organizations as well so this is

489
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:05,510
a in a nutshell this is

490
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,918
how we structure it I've mentioned it

491
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:08,840
verbally just now because I don't want

492
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:12,020
to shock you with a lot of arrows and

493
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:14,889
boxes but this is the multi entry and

494
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:17,990
exit points that we're talking about so

495
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:20,870
imagine you're a typical mid-career

496
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:23,570
person who's trying to pivot from an IT

497
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:26,629
degree going to specialize in the cyber

498
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:28,490
and you want to you know do this at your

499
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:31,520
own pace but you want to do it in blocks

500
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:34,669
so now you can so this is what we are

501
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:37,039
we're planning to do we have the call so

502
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:40,039
you could do the call and you know you

503
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,929
can take a few months semesters break

504
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:43,429
and then you come back again and then

505
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:46,520
you if you need a foundation you can do

506
00:22:43,429 --> 00:22:48,039
another six months and if you want to do

507
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:50,658
the specializations you can do another

508
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:54,140
six more months here and 6 more months

509
00:22:50,659 --> 00:22:56,809
here part of the attractiveness of this

510
00:22:54,140 --> 00:23:00,200
electives is that one of the electives

511
00:22:56,809 --> 00:23:03,379
will be housing and recognizing your

512
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,659
prior certification experience so one of

513
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:07,669
the electives will be saying if you have

514
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:09,950
a CISSP already that's great

515
00:23:07,669 --> 00:23:11,870
right we recognize it as a credit and

516
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,200
we'll acknowledge that as part of your

517
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:14,840
degree

518
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:17,780
yeah we'll also be holding courses on

519
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:19,879
campus to facilitate trainers to for

520
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:22,039
students it's an optional thing but if

521
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:24,080
they want to do it they can this is

522
00:23:22,039 --> 00:23:27,350
following the Royal Holloway model right

523
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:29,270
and we have the capstone project which I

524
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:32,360
mentioned just now so in the four

525
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:36,500
different specializations we will see a

526
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:39,110
cohort of cohorts of different experts

527
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:41,179
in different fields and over time we'll

528
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:43,850
be adding more and more right so we are

529
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:46,880
going to add areas like you know health

530
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:48,889
health sciences medical and and we have

531
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,659
a critical infrastructure specialization

532
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:53,390
and so on and so forth it's gonna yeah

533
00:23:50,659 --> 00:23:57,409
but for now for without resources this

534
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:59,120
is what it is and aligning to the NIST

535
00:23:57,409 --> 00:24:02,150
framework so this is the presentation

536
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:05,299
slide that I stole from my presentation

537
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:06,980
too nice so we went we went over to the

538
00:24:05,299 --> 00:24:10,610
DC area to gatorsburg

539
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:12,980
actually - and and we we presented this

540
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:16,010
to them and they validated that yeah

541
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:18,590
Ryan is not speaking nonsense so it

542
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:20,240
we this is something that they would

543
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,980
love to see that happening I also gave

544
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,299
them some feedback about you know what

545
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,760
are the missing areas in a nice

546
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:29,168
framework that we can work together

547
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:33,740
right so we're also contributing today

548
00:24:29,169 --> 00:24:35,750
last week we helped so this is coming

549
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:38,059
back to you know what we are doing right

550
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:39,940
now before we launch the Masters our

551
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:42,980
masters will be launched next year on

552
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:45,410
from semester two but we are starting to

553
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:49,250
receive inquiries and we're trying to

554
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:52,580
develop and polish up how we offer it so

555
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:56,000
last year we last week we had the father

556
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:59,210
of fuzzing professor Barton Miller right

557
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,640
he came and delivered his secure coding

558
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:05,660
and automated assessment whose workshop

559
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:07,669
who attended that just curious yeah was

560
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:10,130
it was it okay did you yeah it was good

561
00:25:07,669 --> 00:25:13,280
yeah so it's a full-day workshop we were

562
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:15,710
just testing you know how do we deliver

563
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,270
that I think the the spark came when it

564
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:19,580
was a hands-on session when people

565
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:21,110
started to you know work on work on it

566
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:22,668
and of course we have the AUSA

567
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:23,809
conference which we are we are currently

568
00:25:22,669 --> 00:25:26,600
at right now yeah

569
00:25:23,809 --> 00:25:28,879
so the validation of Industry is a

570
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:32,230
continuing continuing process for us and

571
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,230
we are trying to do that right now and

572
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:38,630
if you are interested in in joining us

573
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:41,210
you know there are many ways to join us

574
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:44,360
for example you can participate as a

575
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:48,799
mentor we have a distinguished speakers

576
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:50,899
a segment we have the guest lecturer

577
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,070
program where we will you know if you

578
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:54,080
say that hey I've this is something

579
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:56,000
passionate I want to speak about that

580
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,520
thing you know I want the future

581
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,970
generations to do to learn about that's

582
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,000
great

583
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:04,070
we also hiring adjunct lecturers and

584
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,530
professors we're offering the

585
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:08,418
internships and there's this interesting

586
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:11,629
thing which I which I which I found was

587
00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:13,910
very meaningful is if you would like to

588
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:16,100
you know give back so there are stories

589
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:18,410
of people who actually benefited from

590
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,270
bursar resource scholarships in the past

591
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:22,070
from someone else and you want to pay it

592
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:24,590
forward you don't have to be a

593
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:26,870
multi-millionaire all you do is just say

594
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:29,178
okay um I think I'm quite interested in

595
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:29,959
just sponsoring one person from a

596
00:26:29,179 --> 00:26:32,330
certain them

597
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,830
graphical background right off of a

598
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:35,480
sudden financial background and say you

599
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:37,870
know if there's such a person I'll be

600
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:40,970
quite happy to do that so this is a

601
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:42,709
possibility as well and if you think

602
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:44,960
that you know what I've shown you is

603
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:47,899
something that you would like to comment

604
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:57,350
about just come to us so with that thank

605
00:26:47,899 --> 00:27:01,399
you very much so open to questions if

606
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:07,370
that's time yeah yeah we've got what's

607
00:27:01,399 --> 00:27:11,600
that two minutes I think sorry

608
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:13,639
seven minutes you had a potential for

609
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,370
structural specializations and you had

610
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:19,700
those four specializations yep

611
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:21,439
just wondering where you came to pick

612
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,690
those four I presuming that's what

613
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,600
you're thinking might be industry need

614
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:28,480
and it's my industry could you just how

615
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:32,230
you did that and what was thinking

616
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:35,390
behind it so there was a year and a half

617
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:37,909
homework done by Katherine and her team

618
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:40,549
Katherine and John where they conducted

619
00:27:37,909 --> 00:27:42,799
a an industry-wide survey they also

620
00:27:40,549 --> 00:27:45,100
looked at all the existing degrees from

621
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:47,929
around the war and in in Australia and

622
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:50,209
then we looked at a nice framework and

623
00:27:47,929 --> 00:27:52,909
we also looked at the sector needs so we

624
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:58,059
started to divide into the sectors like

625
00:27:52,909 --> 00:28:02,539
for example if you are from Defense ASD

626
00:27:58,059 --> 00:28:06,470
you know and so on and or if you're in

627
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:09,529
the software provider trying to do

628
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:13,070
crypto solutions or in a defence prime

629
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:15,500
company then the crypto stream might be

630
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:17,299
very attractive to you and then the

631
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,740
criminology one is the interactions with

632
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:22,750
the police and the law enforcement

633
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:25,130
people the leadership one which I didn't

634
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:28,370
elaborate just now is kind of like an

635
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:31,970
MBA for cyber so if you have about two

636
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:33,918
years experience in the workforce and

637
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:38,090
you're trying to pivot into a size o or

638
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:40,580
C so you can you can start to think so

639
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:42,980
it's gonna be taught by the MBA folks my

640
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:45,949
colleagues study at the Business School

641
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:48,260
and they're gonna implement some of

642
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:51,590
those techniques into the the

643
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:53,390
cybersecurity constraints and you know

644
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:55,730
it's it's gonna be quite interesting

645
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:57,919
yeah so the the it's not about how to

646
00:28:55,730 --> 00:29:01,250
become an effective leader doing

647
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:02,540
organizational management and doing the

648
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:05,510
right budgeting thinking about

649
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:07,159
operational constraints communications

650
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:09,559
and so on so forth and then the

651
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:11,780
traditional cyber defense one which we

652
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:15,350
are very familiar with yeah I hope that

653
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:17,389
answers your questions I was on when he

654
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:20,149
asked question was similar topic yeah I

655
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:21,500
was done no dreams your presentation

656
00:29:20,150 --> 00:29:24,650
given the complex industry knowledge

657
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:26,870
required post graduation from of just a

658
00:29:24,650 --> 00:29:28,640
bachelor's degree five to ten years

659
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:31,668
experience to work effectively in the

660
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:34,730
information security sector yeah even

661
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:37,309
for or even just um for mid-tier ICT

662
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:39,980
roles how do you effectively propose to

663
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:41,899
actually uplift students or people who

664
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,340
have actually had minor and like two to

665
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,630
three years of industry experience yeah

666
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:46,250
to the point where they can actually be

667
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:47,390
effective walking straight into some of

668
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:51,350
the roles that we're actually requiring

669
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:53,210
in industry we can do that immediately I

670
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:55,510
think some things cannot be shortcut you

671
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:57,980
know experience still has to be gained

672
00:29:55,510 --> 00:30:00,559
but what we want to do is to equip them

673
00:29:57,980 --> 00:30:02,809
with the mindset of continual thinking

674
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:05,149
right that they can enable them but

675
00:30:02,809 --> 00:30:06,230
during the entire course as you can see

676
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:08,690
from the partners that we're working

677
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:11,299
with they will be having contacts and

678
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:13,870
networks like never before and that's

679
00:30:11,299 --> 00:30:16,129
that's that's another thing and in the

680
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:18,739
educational space right we have to

681
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:20,210
consider the basic skills the vocational

682
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:23,240
skills and also some of the strategic

683
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:24,830
skills so working with the TAFE colleges

684
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,770
we actually try and see how we can

685
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:29,178
complement each other as well and moving

686
00:30:27,770 --> 00:30:32,389
into the leadership we're trying to see

687
00:30:29,179 --> 00:30:35,320
how we can we can educate the the bots

688
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:38,270
or the C Suites through our leadership

689
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,770
specialization it's good to video taking

690
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:41,629
