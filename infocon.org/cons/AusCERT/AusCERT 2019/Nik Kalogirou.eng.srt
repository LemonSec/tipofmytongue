so it's my pleasure to introduce Nick

2
00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:07,529
Nick is the vice-president of AIPAC

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:09,929
sales at conference Nick's responsible

4
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:11,700
for helping organizations build on their

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:14,700
security strategy throughout the APEC

6
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:18,930
region by helping make humans part of

7
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:21,270
the solution in every company he will be

8
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:30,960
helping deal with cyber threats it's my

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:33,180
pleasure to introduce Nick thank you

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,890
very much just one quick correction it's

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,880
Co fence not convinced but that's all

12
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,290
right it doesn't look like there's a

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,800
name in there somewhere

14
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:42,149
and I know I'm the last presentation

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,968
before coffee break so I'm going to try

16
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,680
to keep this as light as possible and

17
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:48,539
also as fast as possible so if I'm going

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,760
too fast just tell me to slow down I am

19
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:52,440
a Greek who speaks too fast so sorry

20
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,660
about that now for those that don't know

21
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,750
we used to be called fish meat we

22
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,169
changed our name in February 2018 to KO

23
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:02,699
fence and we changed our name because

24
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,500
predominantly fish me as a company will

25
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,298
the first guys to get into the security

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,540
awareness program so we were the first

27
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,640
company to educate customers simulate

28
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,930
them on phishing type of tax and fish

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,850
pee was a good name that told people

30
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,280
what we did we fish them that's what we

31
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,399
were doing as an organization but we

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,290
changed in February 2018 because we have

33
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,130
a very large global footprint of

34
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:28,890
customers sorry too soon we have a large

35
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:30,570
footprint of global customers and those

36
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,890
guys were telling us they needed more

37
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,649
from us in what we were doing from a

38
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:37,259
fishing perspective so we really started

39
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,790
to develop new tools more tools to

40
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:40,950
really help people from a fishing

41
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,119
perspective to stop phishing attacks and

42
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,950
now we changed our mission when we

43
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,479
changed our name and our mission is to

44
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,790
enable the world to stop phishing

45
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:49,979
attacks in their tracks and we do that

46
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:52,560
from a collaborative and a cooperative

47
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:55,110
defense program so the CEO is for the

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,270
collaborative or cooperative and the

49
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,219
fence is for defense although the

50
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:01,229
Americans spell fence with an S so

51
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:05,309
that's why it's Co fence with an S Norco

52
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:06,960
fence with a with a seat so today we're

53
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:08,699
going to talk about a few uncomfortable

54
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,869
truths we're going to and we've gone

55
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,679
through these truths with all our

56
00:02:09,869 --> 00:02:13,049
customers that we

57
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,459
globally one of the things this slide is

58
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:16,650
telling us and this is taken from the

59
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:18,180
Verizon data breach investigation report

60
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,390
and there's lots of reports that say

61
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,939
very similar things that fishing is a

62
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:25,589
number one vector for attacks into

63
00:02:23,939 --> 00:02:27,480
organizations so this is saying that

64
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:30,540
phishing and protect texting represent

65
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,540
98 percent of social incidents and 93

66
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:36,469
percent of breaches but emails are the

67
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,219
things they'd get into our customers

68
00:02:36,469 --> 00:02:41,760
organizations and they caused those

69
00:02:38,219 --> 00:02:43,590
breaches now as measured as mentioned we

70
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,720
talked to a lot of enterprise customers

71
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,489
across the world and and because of that

72
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:49,019
we have good relationships with

73
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:52,049
different stakeholders within the

74
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:54,000
organization and our main goal is to

75
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:56,159
understand the needs of each of those

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,200
stakeholders that we deal with from a

77
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,939
security awareness perspective we need

78
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:02,010
to understand what their objectives are

79
00:02:59,939 --> 00:03:04,078
and how we can help build them a program

80
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,939
to better defend against the types of

81
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:08,549
attacks that are out there and so they

82
00:03:05,939 --> 00:03:11,280
can build a campaign to launch into

83
00:03:08,549 --> 00:03:13,379
their system to test their users and the

84
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,269
CeeCee's and executives they really want

85
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:17,518
to stop fishing so their main goal is to

86
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:18,750
understand why it's happening and where

87
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,699
to put the resources within an

88
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,109
organization and obviously the security

89
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:23,430
operation teams they're the ones that

90
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:26,099
are getting all this information they

91
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:27,930
need visibility on how to control each

92
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:30,569
of those attacks that are happening in

93
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,040
that in their organization but we

94
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:35,668
believe there's another stakeholder that

95
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:38,250
is critical to the team and that's the

96
00:03:35,669 --> 00:03:40,259
end user so that's the people the staff

97
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:42,449
in your organization we believe there

98
00:03:40,259 --> 00:03:44,069
are number one stakeholder to defend

99
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:46,799
against phishing attacks that are coming

100
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:48,388
into your organization and because of

101
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,509
that we've started to look at some

102
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:52,680
uncomfortable truths things that our

103
00:03:50,509 --> 00:03:54,149
customers don't necessarily want to

104
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,379
always admit to but they have over the

105
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:57,090
last few years and because they're

106
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:59,009
admitting to them we're addressing them

107
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:01,379
upfront and the first uncomfortable

108
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:03,478
truth is no matter how good your

109
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:06,418
perimeter defenses are or your perimeter

110
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:09,209
security malicious emails still reach

111
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:11,310
the inbox and we saw that 96 percent of

112
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:14,159
attacks start from a phishing email so

113
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:16,440
we know that all our companies that we

114
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,298
that we serve they heavily invest in

115
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,310
technology and and we do as well we've

116
00:04:18,298 --> 00:04:22,620
got the secure email gateways we have

117
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,900
all our security perimeter defenses in

118
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,639
place and if

119
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,739
organization we talked to does that as

120
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:30,350
well they put those in but those

121
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,090
technologies really they do a great job

122
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:34,970
in stopping the known threats that are

123
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:37,340
out there but phishing attacks are

124
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:39,250
evolving and they're changing soft and

125
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:42,349
that sometimes it's not always easy to

126
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:45,350
use just technology to stop these

127
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:47,000
phishing campaigns that come in if we

128
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,650
were to look at the phishing landscape

129
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,380
that exists out there so so we run a

130
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:53,270
phishing defense center and so we have a

131
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:55,250
large number of customers that we manage

132
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:58,340
everything for them so we send out the

133
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:59,840
campaigns we look at all the emails that

134
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:01,669
they report back and that goes into a

135
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,489
phishing defense Center which is based

136
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:07,490
in the USA and that defense Center gives

137
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:10,430
us so much information that we can look

138
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,930
at and prepare ourselves to the types of

139
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,100
attacks and you know the phishing

140
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,570
landscape as it stands at the moment

141
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,620
there's a lot of different things out

142
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:17,510
there from a malware

143
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:19,099
ransomware trojans I mean ransomware was

144
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:20,750
very popular in Australia about a year

145
00:05:19,099 --> 00:05:22,690
and a bit ago sort of died down a little

146
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,830
bit now but they're still attacking

147
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:28,479
organisations using malware's of

148
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:30,650
different type sorry is my here okay and

149
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,020
the other type of attacks that are out

150
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:34,698
there is a credential phishing and I

151
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,289
heard Trustwave today they were talking

152
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:38,180
about it's it's popular it's out there

153
00:05:36,289 --> 00:05:39,949
credential phishing is a is a big tech

154
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:42,889
that's happening in the marketplace but

155
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:44,389
we're also seeing a huge rise in the

156
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:46,150
spear phishing or the business email

157
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:48,560
compromised phishing we're seeing that

158
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,659
increased quite significantly and when

159
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,520
we think about those bottom two the

160
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:55,250
credential phishing and the business

161
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:57,409
email compromised or BC attacks they're

162
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,599
really hard to defend against just using

163
00:05:57,409 --> 00:06:01,190
technology so if malware came into your

164
00:05:59,599 --> 00:06:03,469
system it comes with a payload it comes

165
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:05,810
with information that you can use

166
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:07,310
technology to stop but these type of

167
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,289
emails when they come in they look

168
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:12,440
benign they look safe they just come in

169
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:14,180
from your normal website mail servers

170
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,159
and and you think these are easy to deal

171
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,720
with so technology won't stop them but

172
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:20,240
they're actually very threatening to the

173
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,199
organization the other thing that we

174
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,570
look at when we look at the threat

175
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,550
landscape is there's two groups if we

176
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:26,960
look at that big circle in the middle

177
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:29,090
there's two types of groups that are

178
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,409
causing the most havoc in the in the

179
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,810
market we put them into two high-level

180
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:34,219
groups the first one is the organized

181
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,650
criminal groups and they're really

182
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:37,409
responsible for the large crimeware

183
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,419
attacks that are

184
00:06:37,409 --> 00:06:41,759
I mean across the world today and

185
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:44,399
they're very financially motivated and

186
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:46,589
they really do those large botnet style

187
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:48,659
attacks and they're also selling in the

188
00:06:46,589 --> 00:06:50,849
dark web fishing tips and ransomware as

189
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:53,699
a service so that's that the number one

190
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:55,080
group that is targeting organizations

191
00:06:53,699 --> 00:06:57,599
today and then the other side right at

192
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,429
the bottom is the nation state sponsored

193
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,860
groups and they're really the groups

194
00:06:59,429 --> 00:07:04,378
like the apts Lazarus and cozy bears and

195
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:06,569
they're more geopolitically focused in

196
00:07:04,379 --> 00:07:08,489
trying to attack and maybe even some

197
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:11,579
government government espionage type

198
00:07:08,489 --> 00:07:13,469
attacks and now those two groups create

199
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:15,089
the tool box that exists in the middle

200
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:19,349
so the middle of our screen there you

201
00:07:15,089 --> 00:07:21,419
can see the different types of tools

202
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:23,009
that the criminals are using to type

203
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:25,109
trying to attack each of the

204
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:28,110
organization now we're seeing probably

205
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:31,439
growth in two of those areas in the

206
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:34,319
probably eleven o´clock area you'll see

207
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:35,639
five file sharing and so this is an

208
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,379
attack that we're seeing that's quite

209
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:39,599
prevalent in the marketplace today so

210
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:43,349
most technologies as we mentioned can

211
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:45,929
detect malware but if you sent a link to

212
00:07:43,349 --> 00:07:48,029
a Google box or Google Drive or a

213
00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:49,619
Dropbox or any of those type of file

214
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:52,349
sharing sites that a lot of companies

215
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:54,959
use today that link will come in because

216
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:56,639
it's a known it might be a service that

217
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:58,829
you're using you might subscribe to to

218
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,569
Dropbox so if it's a known link it will

219
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:03,929
come into the inbox it'll sit within

220
00:08:00,569 --> 00:08:06,209
your users email and you might have

221
00:08:03,929 --> 00:08:08,638
staff click on that eat on that eat on

222
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:10,529
that link therefore creating a quite a

223
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,749
big attack and the other one that we're

224
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:15,079
seeing a sharp increase is probably

225
00:08:12,749 --> 00:08:17,669
about three o'clock and that's the IP

226
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:20,659
geolocation awareness and and basically

227
00:08:17,669 --> 00:08:22,799
that's where they're sending attacks

228
00:08:20,659 --> 00:08:25,739
predominately malware attacks that will

229
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,439
only work in the geolocation that it's

230
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:29,969
targeted to to work in and we saw an

231
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:31,739
example of that came into our fishing

232
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:33,509
defense Center a little while ago so

233
00:08:31,739 --> 00:08:35,490
that's based in the US but reporters

234
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:38,550
were reporting an attack from Brazil and

235
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:39,870
they were sending it to our PDC and our

236
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:42,299
fishing defense Center we're looking at

237
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,828
that email they couldn't really get

238
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:45,930
anything to happen for them because our

239
00:08:43,828 --> 00:08:48,029
based in the US but everything about

240
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:49,680
that email looked like a fish it looked

241
00:08:48,029 --> 00:08:50,930
like a fish's smelt like a fish but they

242
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,760
couldn't get it to react

243
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:55,130
in the way that the Brazilians were

244
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:58,100
saying that it was reacting so then they

245
00:08:55,130 --> 00:09:00,500
our analyst changed his machine to a I

246
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,840
think of Brazilian IP address and then

247
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,610
he was able to download that malware and

248
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:06,680
it was able to see the information in

249
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,030
there it wasn't executing so that

250
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,790
frustrated him a little bit but he was

251
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:13,430
able to see the malware and he then had

252
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,959
pulled that malware apart inside the

253
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:17,479
malware he was able to see that it was

254
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,230
also requiring a Portuguese keyboard to

255
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,460
go on on with it

256
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:21,230
so he changed his keyboard to a

257
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,960
Portuguese keyboard and then that

258
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,250
malware executed and did exactly what it

259
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,590
was supposed to do so there's some

260
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:29,090
pretty large attacks that are coming

261
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:31,390
into the market now the criminals know

262
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:34,160
that if they just send malware

263
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:35,960
technology will stop it well

264
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,610
predominantly technology would do a good

265
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,550
effort in trying to stop it so they're

266
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:42,770
using this toolbox in the middle to

267
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:46,579
ensure that it's not stopped and it gets

268
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:49,130
through to your users inbox so we need

269
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:52,010
to make sure that we stay on top of that

270
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:54,050
as as much as possible and that really

271
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:55,610
brings us on to our second uncomfortable

272
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:58,189
truth and that's you can't defend

273
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,000
against attacks you cannot see so you

274
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:01,690
know if you think about technology

275
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:04,250
trying to stop what's in the marketplace

276
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:05,990
if it doesn't know it's not a known

277
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:08,860
threat or it can't see the threat within

278
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:11,210
there then it'll get in to the inbox and

279
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,760
what we want to do is make sure that the

280
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:16,820
sock gets visibility of the different

281
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,319
types of attack that comes into the

282
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,210
inbox and when we talk about visibility

283
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:22,010
from a phishing perspective we're

284
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:25,040
talking about two types of visibility

285
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:27,050
and so we'd look at it through

286
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,849
we call them lenses so the one on your

287
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,920
left the blue one that's threats that

288
00:10:28,850 --> 00:10:33,350
already exist outside in the wild so

289
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,209
this is stuff that we know about we

290
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,310
might work with peer groups we might be

291
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:38,480
in the banking industry or energy

292
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,469
industry and we're talking with peer

293
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,120
groups we know about different

294
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:43,010
ransomware attacks or different types of

295
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,750
attacks that are out there and we stay

296
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:47,210
across those and we do whatever we can

297
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:49,610
to defend against them but the red lens

298
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:52,220
is the one that we really need to make

299
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:54,350
sure that we are focused on because the

300
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:56,450
red lens is threats inside the network

301
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:58,730
this is bypassed everything that you

302
00:10:56,450 --> 00:11:00,680
already have in place and it's reached

303
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:02,270
your inbox and we call those threats

304
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:04,380
clear and present danger because this is

305
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:07,260
danger that's in your inbox it's

306
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:08,580
already happening as we speak I was

307
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,520
talking to someone yesterday and he said

308
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:14,940
that they have an attack that happens

309
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,620
every time the CEO goes away or goes on

310
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:18,420
it on a business meeting and that's

311
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,620
because a criminal has visibility of

312
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:21,449
that they're already in your system

313
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:23,160
they're aware that got into your system

314
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:24,930
and they're just watching what's

315
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:27,000
happening and then they create those bc

316
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:29,099
attacks from within the organization to

317
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,770
send emails from the ce o--'s says hey

318
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:34,560
on the way can you pay this bill and the

319
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:35,880
finance department no his away and then

320
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,849
they send that bill so these guys have

321
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,410
already got in so they're the type of

322
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,840
lenses that we're using and when we're

323
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:44,790
using that red lens in our PDC we get to

324
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,590
see some interesting information from

325
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:47,969
our customers that we're managing and

326
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:50,160
have been managing over the last few

327
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:52,140
years and I mentioned earlier that we

328
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,430
aren't mint and managing those customers

329
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:56,280
through that phishing defense center or

330
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:57,829
PDC so in there we manage about two

331
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:01,290
million end-user

332
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:03,270
mailboxes and those mailboxes that we're

333
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,650
managing these customers have been with

334
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:07,170
us for a long period of time and they're

335
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:09,569
well conditioned to look for what

336
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:11,640
phishing emails are they're also well

337
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:13,530
conditioned to report that email so we

338
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,000
have a plugin that they can use and they

339
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:16,560
can report that email so these are

340
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,290
customers that we work with very

341
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,329
regularly they do lots of campaigns they

342
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:23,579
try and educate their staff as much as

343
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:27,660
possible if they see something they know

344
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:29,640
to report it but even those we see that

345
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:31,650
when they report it there's one in seven

346
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:34,020
emails that have been reported that

347
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:36,630
contains a malicious or malicious

348
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:38,250
content of some sort and that's quite

349
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:39,780
square even scary when we think about it

350
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,580
because it's a significant volume of

351
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:43,829
emails we've got two million in users

352
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:45,780
with emails coming in and they're

353
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:47,940
reporting as much as possible so it's a

354
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:49,579
pretty big volume but the important

355
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:52,890
thing that we need to remember that our

356
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:55,670
PDC is only seeing the emails that have

357
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:58,380
been reported by our customers after

358
00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:00,870
technology failed to stop it so it gets

359
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:03,090
into the inbox and they need to act on

360
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:05,820
it so whilst technology is doing a great

361
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:08,040
job stopping that volume of coming in

362
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:10,530
there are still malicious emails making

363
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,870
it through to that inbox so we need to

364
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:14,819
make sure that we make humans more

365
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,840
sensitive or make them part of our

366
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:20,440
sensors within the network to help

367
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:22,450
protect against what's out there so of

368
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:25,720
those emails those two million odd users

369
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:27,279
that have come in what have we seen well

370
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:30,160
last year this is a full year that we

371
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,480
saw through our PDC we saw fifty five

372
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,310
thousand four hundred and four

373
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,300
credential harvesting attack emails that

374
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:36,369
have come through these are the emails

375
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,229
that have been reported via those two

376
00:13:36,370 --> 00:13:40,450
million users twenty seven and a half

377
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:42,910
thousand campaigns leveraging cloud

378
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:46,000
services the bottom one is a bit scary

379
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:49,540
because it says 4152 but I only updated

380
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,339
this two days ago the number before was

381
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,380
at the end of quarter three and that was

382
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:54,760
only just over eleven hundred so we've

383
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:58,870
gone from eleven hundred to four

384
00:13:54,760 --> 00:14:00,610
thousand attacks in that BC space in in

385
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:02,890
less than three months so it's quite a

386
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:05,320
significant number of attacks that are

387
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:07,930
hitting our customers and then coming

388
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:09,970
through to our PDC and I'm not trying to

389
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:12,400
bash any technology but remember

390
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:15,430
technology didn't grab this on the way

391
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,449
way through so companies they know that

392
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,819
there's a problem out there and they

393
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:20,260
need to understand that they need to put

394
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:22,120
something in place they need to try and

395
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:25,180
protect against the type of attacks they

396
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:28,470
need to educate their users so it leads

397
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:30,310
us on to our next uncomfortable truth

398
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:32,380
they know that they need to put

399
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:34,119
something in place but even the best

400
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:36,730
security awareness program in the world

401
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,990
will never deliver a zero click rate and

402
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:39,640
I want to just pause on that for a

403
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,960
second of our competitors go out in the

404
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:43,270
market and they say you know you take

405
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:44,710
our program and you drive you click

406
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,160
right down to zero percent and you're

407
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:47,860
saved

408
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:50,770
well you're not saved someone will

409
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:53,080
always click or open an email that they

410
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:55,000
shouldn't open even if you educate your

411
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:57,010
staff some stuff move on you bring in

412
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,720
new people you have to re-educate them

413
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:01,080
by the time you get them recognized to

414
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:03,970
get them to ability to recognize a fish

415
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:06,010
it'll still happen they'll still click

416
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:07,690
on those links but what we're trying to

417
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:09,490
get companies to understand is this is a

418
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:11,980
real statement you will never get zero

419
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:14,050
so what we need to deal with is the real

420
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:16,510
problem and the real problem is real

421
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:18,459
fish that's the real problem the real

422
00:15:16,510 --> 00:15:20,230
fish that are making it into your inbox

423
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:22,180
is not the simulations that we do not

424
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:24,279
the awareness campaigns that we do we

425
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:26,770
need to deal with the real fish that

426
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:29,350
make it into that inbox and we we want

427
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:30,430
organizations to understand and agree

428
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:32,980
with us

429
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:35,469
they are being fished regardless of what

430
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,270
type of organization criminals are going

431
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:39,220
to fish them and when they're fished

432
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:41,050
they need to be able to respond quickly

433
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:42,610
how do I respond to the attack that's

434
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,920
just happened into my organization and

435
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:46,740
then how do i best mitigate that attack

436
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,610
and reduce the risk to my organization

437
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:52,420
so that's what we're trying to get

438
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:53,830
companies to understand and we have a

439
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,660
lot of competitors in the marketplace

440
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:57,100
that say you know if you drive that

441
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,649
click right down I mentioned before you

442
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,450
can get it down to zero or as low as

443
00:15:59,649 --> 00:16:03,730
possible to zero and that's going to be

444
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:05,890
your savior but it won't happen you know

445
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,730
in the last four years we do a lot of

446
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:09,160
campaigns

447
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:11,680
there's over 50 million simulation email

448
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:13,839
sent from our company just in in the

449
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,899
last four years so 15 million emails

450
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:19,270
that have gone out as simulation emails

451
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:22,540
to companies that are well aware of the

452
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:24,339
problem and we see that even though the

453
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:26,410
susceptibility rate or that click rate

454
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:28,959
is reducing it's flattening off over the

455
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:31,180
last years I think we've started hue our

456
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,189
quarter one so January March we're at

457
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:36,189
11.5 percent so it's really just

458
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:38,380
flattening off so 11 and a half percent

459
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:42,370
of most individuals and companies will

460
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:46,050
click on a similar oh sorry oh yeah

461
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:48,790
simulation attack so it doesn't matter

462
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:50,260
what people say about reducing that rate

463
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:51,969
you will still get people click and the

464
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,830
interesting thing is if we think about a

465
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:56,230
company the size of maybe two thousand

466
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:58,570
so let's just take a small organization

467
00:16:56,230 --> 00:17:01,540
of about 2000 individuals eleven and a

468
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:03,820
half percent means that around about 220

469
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:06,670
230 somewhere in that space we'll click

470
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:08,559
on an email when you think about that's

471
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:11,140
less than the people in this room are

472
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:14,079
clicking on or opening up an email that

473
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:15,429
could potentially be suspicious and if

474
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,290
they click on it they enter the

475
00:17:15,429 --> 00:17:20,319
information they could cause so much

476
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:22,540
havoc to your company to your endpoints

477
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,359
can be compromised so that leads us on

478
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:27,159
to our next uncomfortable truth people

479
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,409
say if they're clicking on it users are

480
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:33,760
the problem but we're saying users are

481
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:36,040
not the problem users can be educated

482
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:39,910
and employ to be part of your network

483
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:41,620
defense system and we use this slide to

484
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:43,450
show that so the first that red slide on

485
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:44,379
the top left hand side that was a slide

486
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:46,030
we mentioned before

487
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,890
that's showing that the clicking rate is

488
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:51,190
coming down so it's starting to decline

489
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:52,990
and it's flattening off as over that

490
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:54,970
same period of time we've been educating

491
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:57,130
customers that they need to use or they

492
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:58,780
need to be in a position where they're

493
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,250
reporting so they need to understand

494
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,290
that the behavior we're giving them is

495
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,600
if an email comes through and it looks

496
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:06,550
fishy should I click on it or what

497
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:08,139
should I do you know some of the

498
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:10,389
questions we tell our customers to ask

499
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:12,730
their staff is was I expecting this

500
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:15,250
email you know I just got an email from

501
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:17,050
the CEO saying hey can you please

502
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:19,420
transfer 1 million dollars into this

503
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:21,280
account to pay for this you know is that

504
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:24,550
my level or should I be sending a

505
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:27,570
million dollars based on the CEO does it

506
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:30,070
look like the email was intended for me

507
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,450
should I really be clicking on the link

508
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:33,310
or opening an attachment is there other

509
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:34,690
things I could be doing before I click

510
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,520
on that sort of stuff and it's really

511
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:38,680
the same sentence if it smells like a

512
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:41,139
fish then need to act on it so we're

513
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:44,500
trying to get our users to look at that

514
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:46,570
email sniff it if it doesn't pass the

515
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:48,700
sniff test report it and we have a

516
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:50,260
little button that sits in a lot of

517
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:52,420
different clients it looks like that but

518
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,850
a lot smaller it's a little fish and all

519
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:56,380
they need to do is click on that fish so

520
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:57,939
once they click on it that'll grab all

521
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,560
the relevant information you'll grab the

522
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,750
headers footers any attachments and

523
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,129
it'll send it to wherever you want to

524
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:04,930
send it to is your organization you can

525
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:06,400
send it to your own IT department you

526
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:08,650
can set it to a sock you can send it to

527
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,570
an MSSP or you can send it to us as an

528
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:13,330
organization and we will manage that

529
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:14,679
information and as soon as we get that

530
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:17,290
information as soon as you get

531
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:19,210
visibility on that type of attack then

532
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:22,240
that'll help save and mitigate a whole

533
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:24,520
lot of issues so left hand side is

534
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,800
clicking right hand side is reporting

535
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:29,020
the line underneath that is your

536
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,760
resiliency rate and we get that number

537
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:33,490
by dividing the number of people

538
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:36,090
reporting divided by the number of

539
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:39,100
people clicking and when you divide that

540
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:42,129
it really you can see at the bottom that

541
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:44,770
you become more resilient in actual fact

542
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:47,050
if you look at it says 1.86 so for every

543
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:52,030
one person clicking that's the left hand

544
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:54,639
side 1.8 6 percent is reporting so the

545
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:56,860
more people are reporting the more

546
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,690
defensive you become as an organization

547
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,909
because the criminals know they only

548
00:19:58,690 --> 00:20:02,260
one person in your organization to click

549
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:03,670
on a link to compromise your

550
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:05,379
organization they know that that's why

551
00:20:03,670 --> 00:20:07,090
they keep changing that will that

552
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:09,040
toolbox they keep trying different

553
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:11,260
attacks they just need one person to

554
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:12,820
click conversely we only need one person

555
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:16,420
to report once you've reported the

556
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:18,639
problem the sock MSP whoever is managing

557
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:20,770
this for you has the ability to act on

558
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,450
that information so the question that we

559
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:24,310
always pose is there we always ask our

560
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:25,900
customers which trend do you think has

561
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:28,000
the greatest impact on improved security

562
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:30,220
posture do you think it's just a click

563
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,310
rate alone or is it a click rate with

564
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:35,590
the reporting rate which gives you your

565
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:41,800
resiliency level and that's what we

566
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:43,540
focus on that resiliency side so there's

567
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,830
another uncomfortable truth from our

568
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,750
perspective and where are we talking

569
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:50,220
about our customers most organizations

570
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:52,750
are unable to effectively respond to

571
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:54,940
phishing attacks and we know that many

572
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,860
organizations we work with they've got

573
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,540
great organ operational teams and they

574
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,280
do a great job in deal dealing with the

575
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,260
different types of attacks that are in

576
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:05,139
the market but they're not really

577
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:06,610
equipped to understand the types of

578
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,860
attacks that are coming in they know

579
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,540
there's a problem they've created work

580
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:12,610
groups within their organization to

581
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:15,180
resolve the problem but they're not

582
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:17,919
really in the position to do that and

583
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:19,420
having a good fishing defense program in

584
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:21,460
places lots of really good benefits

585
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:23,260
around there so what we're trying to say

586
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:24,820
is get that collaborative approach when

587
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,680
you talk when the executives and CISOs

588
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:28,659
are talking about understanding the risk

589
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,400
get them working with the security

590
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,690
awareness teams get the security

591
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,940
awareness teams working with your

592
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,410
security operation teams because your

593
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:37,210
security operation teams when you're

594
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:38,920
clicking reporting they'll see the real

595
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:41,050
type of threats that are coming into

596
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,200
your organization so the sock needs to

597
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:45,700
feed that information back down to your

598
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:47,980
security awareness team and then they

599
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,780
can create campaigns based on real-life

600
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:52,090
threats that you are seeing as an

601
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:55,450
organization it could be BC it could be

602
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:57,490
email sort of compromised and credential

603
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:59,110
information but whatever real-life

604
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,760
threat you're seeing the Sauk will see

605
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:03,340
they can feed that back to your security

606
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:06,129
awareness team and then they can feed

607
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:08,649
that back up into the executives and the

608
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:09,950
ceases to create the resources needed

609
00:22:08,650 --> 00:22:13,820
within your organization

610
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:16,519
to drive the right response but we are a

611
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:20,649
big believer in engaging the end-user

612
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:24,139
and educating them sorry i lost my mouse

613
00:22:20,649 --> 00:22:26,389
educating them to report because the

614
00:22:24,139 --> 00:22:28,158
sock really can only work on information

615
00:22:26,389 --> 00:22:30,379
that they see coming in to them they can

616
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,690
only act on when you've sent them that

617
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:34,700
information and rather than just in

618
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:36,679
standard template so here's a template

619
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:38,210
that lots of organizations have

620
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:41,360
pre-built into the awareness program

621
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:46,190
really bespoke two ways that are

622
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:47,779
affecting your company as we mentioned

623
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:50,029
before we really want to create a

624
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:51,289
collaborative collective approach when

625
00:22:50,029 --> 00:22:53,929
we're looking at threats that are

626
00:22:51,289 --> 00:22:55,700
hitting that inbox and if we understand

627
00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:57,440
the problem we understand that there's

628
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,450
real fish that are coming into your

629
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,639
company remember one in seven in our

630
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:03,649
environment that for those managed

631
00:23:01,639 --> 00:23:05,360
customers are real fishers that are

632
00:23:03,649 --> 00:23:07,340
coming into your organization so we need

633
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:10,039
to customers to grasp the fact that the

634
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:13,100
real fish is a real problem and we want

635
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:15,740
to work on that so if we imagine a fish

636
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:18,320
hits that's the the red part there is

637
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:20,389
your organization ready to understand

638
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:23,629
what happens once it's fit once it's hit

639
00:23:20,389 --> 00:23:25,639
are your staff trained enough to do the

640
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:27,919
sniff test to really understand is this

641
00:23:25,639 --> 00:23:30,289
a suspect email and if it is a suspect

642
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:32,299
they know what am I supposed to do you

643
00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:34,100
know many companies have a process in

644
00:23:32,299 --> 00:23:35,360
place and some people stick it on top of

645
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:38,029
their laptop so if they get an email

646
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,709
they've got a copy that email and

647
00:23:38,029 --> 00:23:42,320
forwarded as an attachment and send it

648
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:43,669
to someone but most users a bit lazy so

649
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,149
if they see something they'll just

650
00:23:43,669 --> 00:23:46,279
delete it

651
00:23:44,149 --> 00:23:48,139
deleting doesn't help your company it

652
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:49,549
doesn't help what you need to do which

653
00:23:48,139 --> 00:23:51,678
is why we created this little fishie

654
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:54,620
button that'll sit in outlook Gmail

655
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,480
Lotus Notes and whatever you use and

656
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:58,610
then you can report all that information

657
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:03,080
directly straight to your sock team and

658
00:23:58,610 --> 00:24:04,820
which obviously helps so if we would

659
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,668
look at across that journey and that the

660
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:09,918
problem is hit your staff has suspected

661
00:24:07,669 --> 00:24:11,690
the email they've reported the email

662
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,940
then what do you do with all those

663
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:16,460
emails that are coming in we need to

664
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:18,649
make sure that the users are aware of

665
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,029
sorry your sock is aware of the

666
00:24:18,649 --> 00:24:21,799
different types of emails that are

667
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:23,990
coming in and prioritized the right ones

668
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:25,639
so you can then move on to the animal

669
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:28,490
analytical side and understand the

670
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:30,110
problem to then mitigate the problem and

671
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:32,600
a lot of companies out there they they

672
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:34,250
pen test or they do awareness testing

673
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,959
once maybe twice a year to make sure

674
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:38,810
that you know do we have a problem and

675
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:41,240
nine times out of ten they do but we're

676
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:44,270
saying get a real program in place and

677
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:46,340
fish your customers as in simulation

678
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:49,220
fishes but your staff as often as

679
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:51,740
possible so they become aware of the

680
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,840
issue they report more and then your

681
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,060
sock can handle that in a much larger

682
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,129
system because having a system that can

683
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:59,330
cut through all the noise is critical

684
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:02,030
you know when you're reporting

685
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:04,850
information into that report button and

686
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:07,910
then it goes into prioritize are your

687
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:10,790
socks capable of reducing the noise we

688
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:12,680
have a lot of customers that will click

689
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:14,030
on that button purely because they want

690
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,770
to manage their inbox so it's easier

691
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:17,660
just to click on that it deletes it and

692
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:19,520
moves it on but that's not that just

693
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:21,110
creates a lot of noise for your sock and

694
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,150
in actual fact when we mentioned one in

695
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:25,820
seven emails that come into our PDC and

696
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:28,400
malicious that's being six out of seven

697
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:31,010
that are coming in and not malicious so

698
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,900
that's again a big volume that comes

699
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:34,700
through so you want to have a system in

700
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:38,390
place that allows you to prioritize and

701
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:40,610
reduce the noise so for the spam email

702
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:43,010
that does make it through create rules

703
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:44,929
within that system that rid of the noise

704
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:48,110
so you're only looking at the real

705
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:50,660
priority emails and we also need to have

706
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:53,030
a system in place that can recognize the

707
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:55,430
credibility of those people reporting so

708
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:58,399
one of the tools that we have let's say

709
00:25:55,430 --> 00:26:01,460
I'm a known spam clicker and I'm only

710
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:04,220
sending rubbish through the inbox I get

711
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:05,540
a status and my status is very low so

712
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,950
every time I report it when you're

713
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:08,389
looking at the dashboard they'll go this

714
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:10,760
clown he doesn't know what he's doing so

715
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:12,440
we won't open that cluster of emails

716
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,930
that he sent through but we might have

717
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:17,380
somebody else that's very regular

718
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:19,070
hitting and suspecting high levels of

719
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:21,020
phishing your emails that are coming

720
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:23,000
through so you can have a system in a

721
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:24,560
dashboard that highlights that high and

722
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,060
that means you can prioritize that

723
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:29,030
cluster of all the rest of the rubbish

724
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:30,740
our system also can collate all that

725
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:32,540
information together so even though it's

726
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,980
one attack they might just change a few

727
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:35,930
little things along the way it'll

728
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:37,400
collect and gather all those together so

729
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:40,760
you're dealing with the problem

730
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:43,880
a cluster making it easier to prioritize

731
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:46,220
in reading 300 emails entering in that

732
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,980
inbox so we need to make sure that we're

733
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:50,990
building a system that can help you move

734
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:53,390
along this kill chain along the bottom

735
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:55,910
as quickly as possible to get to that

736
00:26:53,390 --> 00:27:01,310
mitigation area to stop that attack

737
00:26:55,910 --> 00:27:04,100
coming through so let's go on to the

738
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:06,590
next slide which is a little example

739
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:10,100
that we had recently last year of a

740
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:11,870
global customer in in the USA so it's a

741
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,429
large medical organization and they use

742
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:14,870
our technology they use it very

743
00:27:13,430 --> 00:27:17,780
regularly they have everything in place

744
00:27:14,870 --> 00:27:21,560
they do simulations very regularly I

745
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:23,360
think they're up at about twice once a

746
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:25,250
month but then repeat offenders get done

747
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,080
a lot more than that during that time so

748
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:29,300
they've got 12 14 programs that come out

749
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:30,710
every year they click the button very

750
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,419
regularly if they see something they

751
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:33,980
click on it sends all the information

752
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,810
through to our phishing depends at the

753
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,820
phishing defense so they're very

754
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:39,530
conditioned to understand what a

755
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:42,290
phishing email looks like they're very

756
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:45,860
conditioned to report that email but

757
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:47,450
what they did is a nasty fish came

758
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,760
through and this fish that hit the

759
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:53,210
organization that looked very real it

760
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:55,610
came from their CEO and it was trying to

761
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:58,130
get payroll information from them but it

762
00:27:55,610 --> 00:28:00,340
looked really real every single person

763
00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:02,330
that was conditioned to read that email

764
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:05,270
looked at it and thought this is a real

765
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:07,310
email so we need to act on it so but

766
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:11,389
there was a link within the link there

767
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:12,830
was a fake 365 office login page and

768
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:14,630
people clicked on that link actually

769
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:17,600
thousands of people clicked on that link

770
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:20,120
within a very short period of time but

771
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,370
what happened was with the thousands

772
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:25,879
that had clicked on it thousands had

773
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:29,510
also reported it to our PDC so at 11:48

774
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:33,440
the email came through to our PDC and

775
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:35,450
11:49 we had already received the email

776
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,670
and started to go through the

777
00:28:35,450 --> 00:28:41,240
prioritization of it and we realized

778
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:43,850
pretty quickly well within 19 minutes I

779
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:46,460
think was a total time that that is a

780
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:47,480
real fish it was a real problem and they

781
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:50,180
were trying to get that payroll

782
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:51,410
information from and so by 1207 we were

783
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:53,060
able to go back to the customer

784
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:55,670
tell them this is a real attack and

785
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:57,350
mitigate that whole problem no money

786
00:28:55,670 --> 00:29:00,140
left that organization no attack

787
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:01,760
happened to any of the cut any of the

788
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,410
users in that environment

789
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,330
that's our 19 minute one we've just

790
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:07,370
recently put on our website a 10 minute

791
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:08,720
one so it's a little bit faster but the

792
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:10,699
attack was a little bit different so

793
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,410
these are the types of tools that you

794
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,450
need to have in place to ensure that you

795
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:14,990
can shut down an attack in a very short

796
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:17,060
amount of time

797
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:18,140
I think Trustwave mentioned before and

798
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,879
might have been someone else sells this

799
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,770
thing to the average time of the

800
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:24,100
criminal is inner network in Australia

801
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:26,629
is in months

802
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:29,000
so they're inside your network for

803
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:30,620
months before organisations find out

804
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,820
about it and a lot of ways as we

805
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:33,770
mentioned they get any through these

806
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:36,110
emails so to be able to work through

807
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:37,730
this kill chain from left to right in a

808
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:39,010
quick period of time will get them out

809
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:42,170
of your network as quick as possible

810
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:45,020
remember you only need one person to

811
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:48,440
report something for that to be to be

812
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:51,710
worked on so I said I'll be quick so to

813
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:53,990
summary we believe that users are not

814
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:56,330
the problem we believe that with the

815
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:58,580
right campaign in place you can educate

816
00:29:56,330 --> 00:30:00,620
and ensure that your staff are

817
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:03,919
completely aware of what the real

818
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:07,070
problem is and the real problem is that

819
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:09,080
real fish entering your inbox bypassing

820
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:10,850
all the technologies that you have in

821
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,409
place that's the real problem that we

822
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:14,689
need to address and having the right

823
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:16,910
