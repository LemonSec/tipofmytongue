3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:11,700
enjoyed our dinner last night judging

4
00:00:08,309 --> 00:00:13,379
from the noise emanating from the bar in

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:14,910
the foyer to a will into the warehouse

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:16,560

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,990
night and why not but today

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,270

00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,948
can I start by acknowledging the common

10
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,390
bury people who are traditional

11
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:26,010
custodians the land upon which we meet

emergency evacuation procedure is the

16
00:00:31,289 --> 00:00:35,370
same as yesterday in the unlikely event

17
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,419
of an emergency remain calm exit the

18
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,339
building following the instructions of

19
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,160
the staff will assemble near acacia

20
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,000
Avenue on the southern side of the hotel

21
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,819
bathrooms if you hear for the first time

22
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,620

24
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,309
the wall there please turn your phones

25
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,449
to Psalm and as much as possible look up

26
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:52,379
and engage with our speakers today

27
00:00:51,449 --> 00:00:54,570
because we are not mucking around with

28
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,640
this first guest speaker I've been lucky

29
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:58,440
enough for my time as an MC to introduce

30
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,789
a lot of different people with a lot of

31
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,890
different job titles I've introduced

32
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:04,860
CEOs CIOs I've introduced Nobel

33
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:09,479
laureates to stage I've never introduced

34
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:10,740
a former security Empress I sat opposite

35
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,060
this woman at dinner last night if

36
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,949
there's someone for whom the title is

37
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,259
befitting of former security empress it

38
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:18,479
is here to talk on the topic of how

39
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:20,520
security teams can evolve to win friends

40
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,619
and influence people from tender mint

41
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,619
please welcome the wonderful Jesse Erwin

42
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:38,559
I'm totally terrified thank you hello

43
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:40,869
everyone thank you so much for the

44
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,219
wonderful welcome Australia you're kind

45
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:42,610
of amazing and cool and I don't wanna go

46
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:44,710
home

47
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:47,920
by the way no one tell my husband I said

48
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:50,139
that and thank you all for getting up

49
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,860
after what was quite the party last

50
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:56,740
night and coming to attend my talk today

51
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:59,679
I am gonna cover a whole bunch of

52
00:01:56,740 --> 00:02:02,740
stories and opinions and thoughts and

53
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:05,530
feelings about of what we do as security

54
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:07,390
teams I think that we're at a point as

55
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,669
an industry where we really have to step

56
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:12,730
back and think about our identity and

57
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:17,440
our work where we are now and where we

58
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:19,420
want to go so that's what this is so

59
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,489
you're probably wondering why you have

60
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,738
to listen to me today so I might as well

61
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:26,230
explain when I have to talk about my job

62
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:28,030
the only way I can reasonably explain it

63
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,920
whether I'm talking to a bunch of

64
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,600
engineers or I'm talking to

65
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,510
eight-year-olds who just want me to hack

66
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,700
their homework is to say that I protect

67
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:40,298
people from software and I protect

68
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:42,608
software from people I have an extremely

69
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:44,650
non-traditional background to be a

70
00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:47,319
security engineer when I was in

71
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:49,930
university I studied foreign language I

72
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:52,328
studied art history

73
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:53,950
I studied archaeology I worked in a

74
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:58,060
library I worked in a museum

75
00:02:53,950 --> 00:03:01,209
I'm ground zero for inventory being a

76
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:03,400
security problem I started working on

77
00:03:01,209 --> 00:03:06,400
communications in technology when I

78
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:08,170
first moved to the Silicon Valley so I

79
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,500
used to be one of those marketers that

80
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:13,388
everyone swears sells the snake oil by

81
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:17,069
the way marketing team is amazing you

82
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:19,660
better be nice to them or I will get you

83
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:23,099
when I did that work I learned quite a

84
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:26,109
bit about risk security controls privacy

85
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:27,880
and generally all of these topics that

86
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:30,760
are really really hard for the average

87
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:33,040
person to understand and wrap their mind

88
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,250
around when really all they want to do

89
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,138
is make their iPhone work or figure out

90
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,470
how to stand up a VPN so they can watch

91
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:43,070
netflix from Canada

92
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,760
instead of Australia or the u.s. because

93
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:46,090
of this they have a lot of

94
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,040
non-traditional ideas about security - I

95
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:51,110
am the first person to start standing up

96
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,970
and screaming that security is way more

97
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:55,520
than just finding all of the bugs and

98
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:58,040
code we're supposed to stop the bugs

99
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,970
from getting into the code sometimes - I

100
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:05,540
thought maybe we know quite a lot about

101
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:07,820
how humans work and I think that we

102
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:10,820
should start designing security for what

103
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:13,340
we know about people not against them if

104
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:15,650
we know for example people are going to

105
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:18,320
do awful things with passwords we should

106
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:20,798
probably just plan systems around awful

107
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:23,719
passwords and see what we get out of it

108
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:26,780
and finally one of my other crazy ideas

109
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:29,300
is that usability is very much a

110
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:31,909
security problem and more of our

111
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:35,480
security problems that we face stem from

112
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:37,880
IT mishaps than some evil awful sneaky

113
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,980
nation-state adversary getting up in our

114
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,090
business and wrecking our Monday through

115
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:46,340
Friday and our on-call weekends

116
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:48,590
so I'm gonna talk a little bit about a

117
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,960
few things today I want to do a little

118
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,940
bit of a deep dive into what security is

119
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,890
because I don't really even know if we

120
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:57,260
know what it is to be honest but it's

121
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:58,820
been around for a long time I'll talk a

122
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:01,070
little bit about how we can win friends

123
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:03,349
I mean I did say in the title we

124
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:06,380
probably need to cover this a little bit

125
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:09,560
maybe how to influence people but not in

126
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,850
a creepy way in a good way I don't know

127
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,290
what we're gonna do in the middle but

128
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:14,300
somewhere we'll get to the point where

129
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,880
we talk about how we actually improve

130
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:19,370
outcomes and how we get to make more of

131
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,080
a difference and I don't know like maybe

132
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:26,780
go kick everybody's butt and be really

133
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:30,289
competitive and win for a change so okay

134
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:33,169
what is this security thing that we are

135
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:36,800
doing security has existed pretty much

136
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:39,109
since we have as humans it's been around

137
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,450
at least 50,000 years longer than

138
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:43,760
computers and a lot of people these days

139
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:47,919
think that security is a huge technology

140
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:50,960
question it's not actually in my opinion

141
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,590
those people who do tell us that it is a

142
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,909
technology problem they're also

143
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:57,510
people saying that software is eating

144
00:05:53,910 --> 00:06:00,210
the world news for you we've only had

145
00:05:57,510 --> 00:06:02,610
software for like less than a hundred

146
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:05,370
years there were a lot of us around

147
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:08,580
before that and we engaged in a lot of

148
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:11,040
different behaviors as people that

149
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:13,409
really demonstrate security principles

150
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:15,330
one thing I've learned in the work that

151
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:17,670
I've done is that our beliefs in

152
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:21,060
security as individuals as practitioners

153
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:22,380
as consumers as people who buy iPhones

154
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,870
and want to chuck them out the window

155
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:27,540
when they don't work they're about as

156
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:31,320
deeply held is our belief in politics

157
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:33,510
and religion our ideas about security

158
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:37,170
are very much a product of our life

159
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:39,390
experiences and because of that what we

160
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:43,050
might consider to be right or wrong or

161
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:46,380
correct in our work is extremely

162
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:50,040
relative to this this is something you

163
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:52,250
know to be a very very self-evident

164
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:55,170
truth if you've ever gotten into a

165
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:58,130
conversation about a password manager on

166
00:06:55,170 --> 00:07:02,460
our InfoSec water-cooler named Twitter

167
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:07,380
because people I found when I worked at

168
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:09,840
one password would basically choose to

169
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,969
reject or accept a password manager as

170
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,549
if they were choosing between the old

171
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:17,790
gods the New Gods the flying dragon gods

172
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:20,100
or no gods for me thanks like it's an

173
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:22,380
episode of Game of Thrones what's

174
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,810
interesting about this is when you start

175
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,640
talking to people online about password

176
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:31,230
managers or you see a discussion going

177
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:33,690
on the moment someone disagrees with a

178
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:35,700
personal choice of which product which

179
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:38,820
tool whether you should even use that

180
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:42,229
class of software or not it turns into

181
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:44,580
an all-out holy war of authentication

182
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:46,650
what's interesting about this is that

183
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,710
the choice of whether to use a password

184
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:51,870
manager or not is an extremely personal

185
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,549
choice and for many people it's also the

186
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:56,190
most important decision they're going to

187
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:59,220
make about their online security and if

188
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:02,520
there's one thing that is crystal clear

189
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:04,350
if you criticize the most important

190
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,010
choice that someone makes about their

191
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,670
security

192
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:08,130
if you

193
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:10,950
make them feel bad for using you know

194
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:13,950
purple pass instead of yellow pass there

195
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:16,200
will be held to pay it's an insult to

196
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:18,510
the intelligence of most people to the

197
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,760
experiences that led them to making that

198
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:23,640
decision or rejecting that decision and

199
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:26,550
it is all around probably one of the

200
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:30,960
most interesting as technology adoption

201
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:32,820
cases in our industry so okay

202
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,699
I mentioned Security's been around for

203
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:37,590
about 50,000 years give or take

204
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,680
I mentioned that we've seen lots of

205
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:42,030
evidence of security behaviors but

206
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:44,670
there's something that's really

207
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:47,430
interesting that I can never look away

208
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:50,939
from when people started living in

209
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:53,880
constructed settlements about 17,000

210
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:56,400
years ago they started building walls to

211
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,680
protect themselves almost instantly I

212
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,870
think the first thing I figured out how

213
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,380
to break when I started using a computer

214
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:06,470
was called a firewall and suddenly all

215
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:09,480
of these magical things made sense to me

216
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:11,940
when people started living in

217
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,250
settlements they also started securing

218
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:17,060
their valuables by hiding them we see

219
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:19,620
evidence of this to this day when

220
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:21,569
archeologists are going and digging and

221
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:24,840
looking for forensic evidence of past

222
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:26,430
peoples and they start finding coin

223
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:28,980
hoards with more money than they could

224
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:31,290
have ever imagined because people had to

225
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,240
protect the thing most valuable to them

226
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,430
and it's not like they had a crazy

227
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:37,260
modern banking system and debit cards

228
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:41,250
and all of these fabulous tokens for

229
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:43,800
payment that we get to have now another

230
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:46,830
thing that's really interesting some of

231
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:50,069
the earliest evidence of security comes

232
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:52,190
from locks and there are so many locks

233
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:55,500
when you look in the historical record

234
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:57,750
that come from as far back as ancient

235
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:00,840
Egypt something I think is really

236
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:02,520
interesting is these days we run around

237
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:04,890
with our key cards to get into our

238
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:08,490
office building we have our UV keys and

239
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:11,730
our u2f tokens people use to wear their

240
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:14,820
keys to their locks like a pendant have

241
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:17,010
them made into a ring or put them in a

242
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:19,530
place close to them for safekeeping so

243
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:22,080
that they were always physically secure

244
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:24,770
and it was a little bit of an indicator

245
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,850
of wealth but really what it said was

246
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:28,860
you were bound to have something

247
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:31,860
valuable enough that needed protecting

248
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:34,080
if you had one of these things it

249
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,480
reminds me a little bit now of when I

250
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,010
see someone get really excited and make

251
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,660
a pair of earrings out of you B keys

252
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:41,689
because that's a pretty good way not to

253
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:45,270
lose them and also they're kind of fun

254
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:47,340
and it also reminds me of how we see

255
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:50,730
people hand out business cards that have

256
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:52,800
their PGP keys on them even though sorry

257
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:55,590
guys I don't think I've used PGP in a

258
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,240
good five years another thing that's

259
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:59,930
interesting in terms of security

260
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:02,190
behavior before computers ever existed

261
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:04,800
tamper-evident locks have been around

262
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:06,870
for a really long time when it wasn't

263
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,329
good enough to just have a key to get in

264
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:11,940
or get out because we knew people could

265
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:14,040
probably break into a lock someone

266
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:16,830
designed locks that said hey actually

267
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,500
someone messed with me in the 17th

268
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:21,840
century so think about that for a second

269
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:24,480
we talked a lot about you know

270
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:27,480
authentication bypasses and breaking

271
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,760
into things and evil made attacks but

272
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:32,790
these problems existed well before

273
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,890
computers did and the reason we had

274
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:37,260
these particular security behaviors is

275
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:40,560
because we were trying to overcome human

276
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:43,830
problems with technology not the other

277
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,660
way around another thing that I think

278
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:50,310
quite a bit about when I'm thinking

279
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:52,709
about security is these seal stones so

280
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:54,540
three to five thousand years ago when

281
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:57,270
people were still sending little bits of

282
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:59,459
paper back and forth long before we ever

283
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:01,680
got into any crypto Wars on any

284
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:04,260
continent and had computers to worry

285
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,359
about people were sending their little

286
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:10,110
bits of paper or packages that were

287
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:13,680
stamped with wax and the little mark on

288
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:16,650
there would say hey this is from Sarah

289
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,870
Sarah sent you some nice wine here's how

290
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:21,630
you know it's her there we are

291
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,560
it was a form of identification and it

292
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:24,510
was a little bit of a form of

293
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,930
authentication there are also these

294
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:29,220
really interesting seal Scrolls that

295
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:30,810
basically look like a bead they're about

296
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,760
this big when you see them in a museum

297
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:35,760
and you

298
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:38,460
roll one across hot wax to get a very

299
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:41,130
specific signature it's almost like the

300
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,840
ancient version of that Amazon tape that

301
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:44,460
they put on all of those cardboard boxes

302
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,710
we all have to throw out the back door

303
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:50,370
and hope that the recycling man won't

304
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:53,250
pick up so if we think we have it bad

305
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:56,040
with fishing now if we think we have it

306
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:58,380
bad with trying to make sure that

307
00:12:56,040 --> 00:13:01,560
encrypted messages are signed the right

308
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:03,689
way think about how difficult it would

309
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,390
have been a few hundred years ago or a

310
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:08,880
few thousand years ago to verify

311
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:12,090
information to get ahead of someone

312
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:16,140
who's got a forgery scheme to figure out

313
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:18,210
whether something is fake or not letters

314
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,400
being intercepted and open we're still a

315
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:22,380
problem we're all freaking out about

316
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:24,810
that with what's happening with our

317
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:27,570
end-to-end encryption and does TLS do

318
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:28,890
the things we think the TLS does or did

319
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:33,480
somebody do something to it that they

320
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:35,460
shouldn't have and then finally about a

321
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,020
thousand years later after the seal

322
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:39,060
stones weren't doing it anymore

323
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:41,460
there's another human behavior that

324
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:45,650
popped up that's really interesting so

325
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:48,720
this this is called a letter lock and

326
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:50,790
what it does is pretty simple the person

327
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,070
who would write a letter would actually

328
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:56,280
end up folding it in a very specific way

329
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:59,370
that they designed to show evidence of

330
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:01,949
tampering it's a little bit like now how

331
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:04,350
when we open up signal and someone's

332
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:07,140
security Keys changed except in this

333
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:09,810
case the security key would be looking

334
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:12,090
at whether the wax that would make its

335
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,410
way down into the middle of the fold had

336
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,910
been compromised

337
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:17,189
whether it was grainy whether it had

338
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:18,870
broken that would be the evidence of

339
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:23,790
whether something's was was messed with

340
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:26,400
or not okay so we went through this

341
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:28,380
whole thing about you know what does

342
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:31,260
security look like before the computers

343
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:34,110
but the thing that's really important to

344
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:37,590
take away is we have a lot of ideas as

345
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:42,240
security people about what security is

346
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:45,470
and they are based pretty much in our

347
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,810
political beliefs and almost are

348
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:50,630
religious beliefs it's that serious and

349
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:52,369
that core of an identifying factor for

350
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:55,189
us when we move forward and we do our

351
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:57,950
work the problem with that is sometimes

352
00:14:55,190 --> 00:15:00,170
we get into very big arguments about

353
00:14:57,950 --> 00:15:02,570
principles and when we get into those

354
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:04,880
really big arguments about principles we

355
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:07,790
lose sight of the tiny things we need to

356
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,250
be doing day to day to actually get the

357
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:13,370
job done and to actually drive

358
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:14,540
incremental improvement so now we have

359
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,180
to tell you how to make some friends

360
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:19,719
when some influence get some people on

361
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:22,280
our side so that's this part of the talk

362
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:25,250
one thing that's really important for

363
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:28,819
security teams to think about is where

364
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:30,380
power comes from there's some political

365
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:32,720
science in here there's some

366
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:34,700
anthropology in here this is all of

367
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,250
those classes that lots of people did

368
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:39,260
not want to take at university but a lot

369
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:41,900
of secrets into what makes your team

370
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:43,939
successful come from all of these

371
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,340
squishy human factors that everyone

372
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:47,990
likes to call soft skills

373
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:50,960
protip they are not soft they are

374
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:55,520
extremely hard to get right and very

375
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:58,070
very squishy so if we're asking you know

376
00:15:55,520 --> 00:16:01,010
where power comes from as a security

377
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:02,960
team it's interesting to look at the

378
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,240
political world because there's a

379
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:09,710
never-ending debate about whether hard

380
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:12,560
power or soft power is what wins among

381
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:14,090
the nation states it's a question of you

382
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,510
know should we be using armies and

383
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:20,480
weaponry or should we be advancing

384
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:22,790
diplomacy relationships discussions and

385
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,530
scent of alignment writing policy

386
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:27,860
documents and wooing each other back and

387
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:30,140
forth to see if we can get to where we

388
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:32,840
need to go in our work as security

389
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:34,880
practitioners it's not quite that messy

390
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,740
I don't think any of us have armies that

391
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,410
we roll out when we're about to really

392
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:43,280
go to war with the IT team if you do can

393
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:46,459
I borrow them but in our work the

394
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:48,980
question for us about power really comes

395
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:51,560
from another place and it's this are we

396
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:56,090
a team that says yes or are we a team

397
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:59,060
that says no so I live in the Silicon

398
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:59,400
Valley and where I live there are a lot

399
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,650
of tea

400
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,959
that take pride in the fact that they

401
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:05,879
have the ability to veto the release of

402
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:09,060
any product that comes out of their

403
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:10,470
company in fact they get really excited

404
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,210
about this if you interview with them

405
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:14,430
and they start talking about how

406
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:19,230
security is so important and it's such a

407
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:22,980
top priority except I don't think that's

408
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:26,099
how any of this works because if you as

409
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:28,079
a team have the ability to rip something

410
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:30,030
right out of the hands of hundreds of

411
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,580
people who have been working on it for a

412
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:34,860
really long time just because you said

413
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,560
so five minutes before it's going to go

414
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,510
public

415
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:42,929
where were you when people were getting

416
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:46,110
started with this work how did you get

417
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:48,630
the ability to roll in and say no if you

418
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:51,270
didn't actually show up at the beginning

419
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:54,750
of the development process with a set of

420
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:57,060
requirements with a set of things to

421
00:17:54,750 --> 00:18:00,030
watch out for with information with

422
00:17:57,060 --> 00:18:02,460
resources and with all of this security

423
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:05,639
knowledge we have that can help us make

424
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:08,880
the most unbelievable creative bonkers

425
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:11,940
ideas come to life some people think

426
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:15,020
it's amazing to be able to roll in and

427
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:18,420
completely destroy you know an entire

428
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:21,030
revenue generating product stream for

429
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,530
two quarters just because they're really

430
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:25,470
not excited about the way somebody

431
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:28,410
rotated a key somewhere never mind that

432
00:18:25,470 --> 00:18:32,280
the key in question is a relatively low

433
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:34,710
risk asset and development roadmap is

434
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:37,860
gonna have that ripped out within six

435
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:39,300
months of the product shipping something

436
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:41,189
that's really important to think about

437
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:44,730
here is this you know security teams

438
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:47,100
wonder when they're the team of know why

439
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:49,290
no one wants to come and hang out why

440
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,330
they have difficulty getting traction

441
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:53,510
within their organizations and the

442
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:55,500
answer is kind of simple in fact

443
00:18:53,510 --> 00:19:00,060
something you can learn by playing with

444
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:02,520
LEGOs if you are the team that comes in

445
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:04,649
and you literally take everyone's toys

446
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:07,620
away or you tell them that they are

447
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:11,790
playing with their toys wrong or that

448
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:13,189
thing they made for fun is total crap of

449
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:15,289
course they're not going

450
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:17,269
to want to hang out with you of course

451
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:20,210
they are not going to want to listen to

452
00:19:17,269 --> 00:19:22,639
you of course they are not going to

453
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:24,679
share their Legos with you and I don't

454
00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:29,059
know what you guys but it sucks to not

455
00:19:24,679 --> 00:19:31,690
be part of a lego party so on another

456
00:19:29,059 --> 00:19:34,340
scale we have the issue of our

457
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:37,429
profession globally just not being

458
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:40,249
successful if you look at the

459
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:42,979
conversations we have and our beloved

460
00:19:40,249 --> 00:19:45,470
InfoSec water-cooler named Twitter they

461
00:19:42,979 --> 00:19:48,499
look a little something like this more

462
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:51,710
often than not and there's a lot of

463
00:19:48,499 --> 00:19:54,320
arguing that comes from this place of

464
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:58,190
security team thinking to be successful

465
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:00,619
they need to be in control they need to

466
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:03,259
be playing politics they need to be

467
00:20:00,619 --> 00:20:05,599
jockeying for power the problem with

468
00:20:03,259 --> 00:20:07,909
that for anyone who spent way too much

469
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:11,389
time in European history is that

470
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:15,049
eventually absolute power unchecked

471
00:20:11,389 --> 00:20:18,258
power ends up being a really toxic hell

472
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:19,580
still it ends up creating an environment

473
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:23,119
where you don't have psychological

474
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:25,789
safety for your team for your colleagues

475
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:28,309
for your ideas and you don't feel like

476
00:20:25,789 --> 00:20:31,009
you can speak up or you can actually

477
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:34,279
advocate for the things that will make a

478
00:20:31,009 --> 00:20:37,249
real difference no one succeeds in that

479
00:20:34,279 --> 00:20:39,649
environment not on a community level not

480
00:20:37,249 --> 00:20:42,289
on a team level and most definitely not

481
00:20:39,649 --> 00:20:45,018
an industry level if you've ever worked

482
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:47,210
for a team whose enforcement mechanisms

483
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:48,979
were a bunch of policies that were

484
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:53,299
locked away in a drawer that no one had

485
00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:56,210
access to you've experienced this very

486
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:58,908
very specific exquisite form of pain and

487
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:01,309
it stinks because it's a total double

488
00:20:58,909 --> 00:21:04,129
standard security teams can scream all

489
00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:07,070
day long about transparency and doing

490
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:09,259
all of this wonderful stuff but then

491
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:11,928
when someone wants to come back and

492
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:14,599
audit they use the control they have and

493
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:15,289
saying no you can't question us that's

494
00:21:14,599 --> 00:21:17,779
not cool

495
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:21,139
especially when most of the time the

496
00:21:17,779 --> 00:21:22,729
security team already has visibility

497
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:25,008
into everything inside of an

498
00:21:22,729 --> 00:21:25,630
organization but they can't even turn

499
00:21:25,009 --> 00:21:28,299
around

500
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:30,100
and share their thinking because they

501
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:32,139
don't want to be questioned and don't

502
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:35,559
want to give away Legos or share them

503
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:37,660
with anyone else if we want to make

504
00:21:35,559 --> 00:21:40,178
friends we're gonna have to learn how to

505
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:42,220
play together nicely with others if we

506
00:21:40,179 --> 00:21:44,740
don't want regulators walking in and

507
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:46,360
taking our toys away forever we're gonna

508
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:48,490
have to not only learn how to play nice

509
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,590
we're gonna have to learn how to take

510
00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:52,600
care of our toys better at the end of

511
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:55,030
the day as a security team it is up to

512
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:58,480
us to define our charter to define our

513
00:21:55,030 --> 00:22:01,030
identity and to decide who we want to be

514
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:04,360
as individuals and if we approach others

515
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:07,210
from a place of control and we have a

516
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:10,149
top-down authoritarian point of view we

517
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:11,980
are not going to get anything done which

518
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:16,210
is basically something that we say play

519
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:18,010
out day to day in our own sphere so

520
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,380
another thing that you can do especially

521
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:23,280
if you don't want to be a control minded

522
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:26,289
organization switch your charter

523
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,510
security should be about empowerment it

524
00:22:26,289 --> 00:22:31,990
should be about finding the right way to

525
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:35,460
say yes it should be about helping

526
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:39,669
people make impossible crazy creative

527
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:44,679
bonkers ideas become a reality in a safe

528
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:47,110
way one way that you can do this as a

529
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:49,360
practitioner is to think about your team

530
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:53,379
Charter and find ways to provide

531
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:55,928
expertise and consulting to other teams

532
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:58,179
in your organization but you can also

533
00:22:55,929 --> 00:23:01,750
think about how to focus very

534
00:22:58,179 --> 00:23:04,390
specifically on your user we all spend a

535
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:06,580
lot of time at conferences reading

536
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:08,980
papers going through presentations

537
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:12,939
thinking about attackers we think about

538
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:14,679
attackers all day long however the vast

539
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,990
majority of the security incidents we

540
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:18,730
have to clean up aren't because some

541
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:21,490
teenagers somewhere hacked a mainframe

542
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:24,720
they're most likely because somebody

543
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:27,390
didn't go through a training someone

544
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:29,830
misconfigured something somewhere a

545
00:23:27,390 --> 00:23:32,890
setting that was really important got

546
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:36,790
hidden in a menu that no one ever looked

547
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:38,980
at or quite frankly we just forgot

548
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:41,049
because the process broke somewhere

549
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:42,880
and no one ever reviewed it and figured

550
00:23:41,049 --> 00:23:45,100
out whether the right things were

551
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:49,750
happening to control a particular part

552
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:51,939
of business risk so there's another

553
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:53,559
thing that can help become help you

554
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:55,870
become more of a sort of service

555
00:23:53,559 --> 00:23:57,850
organization there's a really common

556
00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:00,250
assumption that security teams are

557
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:04,030
supposed to know everything now I don't

558
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:06,640
know about you guys and gals but I don't

559
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:09,340
anything mostly because of the Socrates

560
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,660
guy and his friends Aristotle and all

561
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,610
those other smart people who are just

562
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:15,250
like yeah don't bother you're never

563
00:24:12,610 --> 00:24:17,439
gonna learn everything just put yourself

564
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:20,530
in a place where you are constantly

565
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,780
willing to learn and maybe once in a

566
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:25,389
while relearn all of the stuff that you

567
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:28,299
forgot that usually happens on a 10-year

568
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:30,370
cycle something that tends to happen

569
00:24:28,299 --> 00:24:32,350
with security teams more often than not

570
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:34,989
these days is they walk into the room

571
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:37,780
and they think that it is their job to

572
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:39,610
be the smartest people there and to show

573
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:42,100
off that they know more than everyone

574
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:43,809
else this is a huge problem because

575
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:46,120
nobody wants to be friends with a

576
00:24:43,809 --> 00:24:48,850
know-it-all it's nice to know lots of

577
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:50,320
stuff it's not nice when you demonstrate

578
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:53,379
that knowledge in a way that makes

579
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:56,200
people feel dumb and it makes them not

580
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:58,960
want to work with you as a service

581
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,870
organization to be security minded we

582
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,000
should actually take a Socratic approach

583
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:06,189
we should be asking questions we should

584
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,950
be investigating we should be

585
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:12,130
discovering we should be learning with

586
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:14,980
our teams but not doing things for them

587
00:25:12,130 --> 00:25:18,070
as if you know we are the maid or we are

588
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:21,850
the janitor and we are always there to

589
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:25,389
clean up we should be step and step with

590
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:27,219
our team's not behind them not sneaking

591
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:29,890
off in a corner saying ugly things about

592
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:31,630
them it's up to us if our colleagues are

593
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:34,419
actually repeat customers of our

594
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:36,040
organization it's up to us if we make

595
00:25:34,419 --> 00:25:38,950
people feel bad for clicking on a link

596
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:40,809
or installing the malware because if we

597
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:42,760
make them feel bad they don't come back

598
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:45,668
and tell us when they did it by accident

599
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:47,290
again they just hide it and we have much

600
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:51,150
bigger problems that we have to figure

601
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:51,149
out that are much more costly

602
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:56,549
another way to be a little bit more of a

603
00:25:53,369 --> 00:26:00,119
service minded organization is to think

604
00:25:56,549 --> 00:26:02,700
about how we educate others I don't know

605
00:26:00,119 --> 00:26:05,549
about any of you but I hate to be told

606
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:08,489
you cannot tell me what to do you must

607
00:26:05,549 --> 00:26:09,570
politely suggest in the right way it

608
00:26:08,489 --> 00:26:11,549
doesn't make it sound like you're

609
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:12,889
bossing me around like my mom did or

610
00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:16,129
you're gonna be in trouble

611
00:26:12,889 --> 00:26:18,299
possibly a personal leadership flaw but

612
00:26:16,129 --> 00:26:21,869
practically everyone I work with is the

613
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:24,989
same way so what that means for me as an

614
00:26:21,869 --> 00:26:27,090
individual on my team is that I had to

615
00:26:24,989 --> 00:26:30,359
start educating and seeding ideas with

616
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:32,309
people it's one thing if it's time for

617
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:35,369
us to institute a secure development

618
00:26:32,309 --> 00:26:37,619
lifecycle and I walk into a meeting with

619
00:26:35,369 --> 00:26:40,379
my developers and say okay guys you're

620
00:26:37,619 --> 00:26:43,678
doing this now it's another thing if I

621
00:26:40,379 --> 00:26:46,439
let my junior developers experience the

622
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:49,889
frustration of having to find patch

623
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:51,479
triage manage bugs or sweep up a few

624
00:26:49,889 --> 00:26:56,279
things on the bug bounty program and

625
00:26:51,479 --> 00:26:58,559
they come to me and they say hey wait we

626
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:00,359
keep finding all of these bugs and we

627
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:04,590
wanted to write all of this automation

628
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:07,529
to find bugs but isn't it smarter if we

629
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:09,178
just don't make bugs at all usually the

630
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:11,239
young developers like yeah let's just

631
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:14,580
throw the computers in the ocean now

632
00:27:11,239 --> 00:27:16,799
doesn't work that way unfortunately but

633
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:19,739
instead of coming to them and telling

634
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,779
them what to do I can say okay well this

635
00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:24,059
is how we stop bugs from happening

636
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:25,619
before they start this is what you need

637
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:27,418
to know about the language you're using

638
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:29,999
this is what you need to know about

639
00:27:27,419 --> 00:27:31,470
sanitizing inputs these are the three or

640
00:27:29,999 --> 00:27:34,859
four things you can think about in the

641
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:37,619
next month and if you don't have any

642
00:27:34,859 --> 00:27:39,269
bugs and these particular classes not

643
00:27:37,619 --> 00:27:42,359
only will I give you more money we are

644
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:43,919
going to have a fantastic party with

645
00:27:42,359 --> 00:27:47,639
what we didn't spend on bug bounty

646
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:50,340
budget silly stuff but at the end of the

647
00:27:47,639 --> 00:27:53,008
day instead of telling my teams what to

648
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:55,738
do in bossing them around I can lead

649
00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:58,559
them where they need to go and let them

650
00:27:55,739 --> 00:28:01,049
figure things out it is a much better

651
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:03,299
spot to be in if we are service minded

652
00:28:01,049 --> 00:28:04,780
and we are coaching people through

653
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:06,850
solving problems and

654
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:09,550
the critical skills that they need for

655
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:11,469
thinking and problem-solving rather than

656
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:13,899
just dragging them through giving them

657
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:20,740
checklists and forcing them to do what

658
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:22,060
we say no one likes that so another

659
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:25,300
thing that's really important is

660
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:28,030
knowledge sharing there's something that

661
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:30,040
went on in my organization that was a

662
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:33,850
surprising gift and something that I'm

663
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:35,889
extremely proud of in my organization I

664
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:39,070
was the first security hire I have a

665
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:42,940
bunch of security minded developers but

666
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:45,669
I had seven audits over a year-long

667
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:48,880
period because we were about to launch

668
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:50,920
some pretty critical code and all of my

669
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,100
audits were looking at different layers

670
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:55,990
of my code but instead of doing what I

671
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:58,929
had experienced in other security teams

672
00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:01,080
which was sitting in the corner running

673
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:03,840
the audits never talking to developers

674
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:06,699
never making them part of the process I

675
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:09,070
decided I was gonna step back and I was

676
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:12,280
going to be the quietest person and the

677
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:14,409
whole security audit I grabbed my

678
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:17,710
developers and said guys we have kickoff

679
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:20,410
call let's go I've already scoped this I

680
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:22,720
have already taken care of all of the

681
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:25,600
administrative work here's how the

682
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,630
process of the audit is going to go but

683
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,969
show up for the kickoff calls show up

684
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:33,130
for the weekly syncs come and talk to

685
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:37,420
the people who are evaluating your code

686
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:38,830
and see what this is really about so I

687
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:41,670
thought this might be a little bit of a

688
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:44,320
drag because security order is expensive

689
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:47,110
hourly oh my gosh I don't even want to

690
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,379
know how much money I spent but my

691
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:53,169
developers were able to actually be part

692
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:54,250
of a process that previously had scared

693
00:29:53,170 --> 00:29:56,680
the crap out of them

694
00:29:54,250 --> 00:30:00,040
instead of arguing with me about how

695
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:02,680
dumb documentation was they were able to

696
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:06,570
see that auditors needed documentation

697
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:08,740
because they needed to have some form of

698
00:30:06,570 --> 00:30:11,919
information to help them know how the

699
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:15,070
codes supposed to work once my

700
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:17,799
developers saw documentation as a trust

701
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:20,439
problem an integrity problem

702
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:22,658
a security problem my documentation got

703
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:26,139
to be a million times better to the

704
00:30:22,659 --> 00:30:28,749
point that I actually got compliments on

705
00:30:26,139 --> 00:30:31,689
it around audit five or audit six of the

706
00:30:28,749 --> 00:30:33,269
process because my teams were actually

707
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:35,980
motivated to do that work themselves

708
00:30:33,269 --> 00:30:37,989
instead of me running along and yelling

709
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:41,169
at them to go write some more and do

710
00:30:37,989 --> 00:30:43,840
their homework another thing that helped

711
00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:47,320
us out quite a bit too was that I was

712
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:48,789
able to basically get my teams to start

713
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,100
thinking about threat modeling and

714
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:54,279
architecture diagramming it's one thing

715
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:56,859
if I have to try to attend every single

716
00:30:54,279 --> 00:30:58,419
meeting in my organization when

717
00:30:56,859 --> 00:31:01,989
someone's talking about designing a

718
00:30:58,419 --> 00:31:05,169
thing it's another if I can scale myself

719
00:31:01,989 --> 00:31:09,970
if I can create education opportunities

720
00:31:05,169 --> 00:31:13,029
and I can actually give them ways to

721
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:15,279
lead their own work identify their own

722
00:31:13,029 --> 00:31:17,409
risk and then come to me when they need

723
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:19,570
a little bit of proofreading rather than

724
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:21,820
when they need me to come and lead every

725
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:25,629
single thing and be a single point of

726
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:26,889
failure in all of our processes the

727
00:31:25,629 --> 00:31:28,269
other thing that was great is that

728
00:31:26,889 --> 00:31:30,129
instead of having a bunch of developers

729
00:31:28,269 --> 00:31:33,129
who are mad they had to show up for a

730
00:31:30,129 --> 00:31:36,609
6:00 a.m. call I have a whole bunch more

731
00:31:33,129 --> 00:31:40,269
allies no one actually knew how security

732
00:31:36,609 --> 00:31:42,639
audits worked so the whole process was

733
00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:45,129
less scary we ended up having really

734
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:48,070
great engineering conversations instead

735
00:31:45,129 --> 00:31:50,350
of having political warfare over someone

736
00:31:48,070 --> 00:31:53,289
asking why did you code this way as if

737
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:55,809
you were not wearing pants which comes

738
00:31:53,289 --> 00:31:57,519
up in an in a review once in a while and

739
00:31:55,809 --> 00:32:00,340
it was nice to be able to give a

740
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:03,730
behind-the-scenes look at why things

741
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:06,039
have to be done a specific way instead

742
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:08,559
of demanding for my team they must

743
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:11,529
execute on this thousand step fan dance

744
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:14,350
just right they could see what was

745
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:17,080
important what wasn't important and they

746
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:19,418
were able to adjust the way that they

747
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:21,970
performed and they actually became more

748
00:32:19,419 --> 00:32:23,619
accountable at the end of the day to

749
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:28,350
explaining why they made specific

750
00:32:23,619 --> 00:32:30,580
decisions and they wrote better tests

751
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:32,230
so there's another thing if you want to

752
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:34,600
win friends and influence people that's

753
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:37,420
really important you have to put your

754
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:39,730
best face forward I don't mean this is

755
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:43,330
hygiene advice I actually mean that's

756
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:46,090
not a very practical no security

757
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:49,840
practitioners we are compelled to be

758
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:53,050
transparent we will explain how

759
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:55,000
something works to the nth degree to the

760
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:57,280
point that if we are talking to

761
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,160
non-technical folks we might

762
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:02,370
accidentally tell them everything wrong

763
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:05,080
with what we are asking them to do

764
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:08,260
before they actually get a chance to do

765
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:10,689
it the best place to think about this is

766
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:14,080
how we have discussions about two-factor

767
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:17,590
authentication we have Wars about

768
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:20,040
password managers but we have some ugly

769
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:23,980
battles over two-factor authentication

770
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:27,370
the problem is that some two-factor

771
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:30,160
authentication is better than none for

772
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:33,489
the vast majority of people those people

773
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:35,410
generally aren't us so when we start to

774
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:38,830
talk to users about you know how to

775
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:40,390
protect themselves we will tell them you

776
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:43,090
know you should use two-factor

777
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:44,860
authentication but oh the one that's

778
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:46,629
most prevalent everywhere on the

779
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:48,340
internet the one that sends you a text

780
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:50,830
message that's crap

781
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:53,500
actually let me tell you everything

782
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:55,750
wrong with it let me take away every

783
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:58,960
good reason you might have to change

784
00:33:55,750 --> 00:34:01,270
your behavior and do something that

785
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,230
provides an incremental improvement to

786
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:06,850
your personal security or to our

787
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:09,100
organizational security let me just tell

788
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:10,420
you all the warts and then leave you so

789
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,610
confused that you don't know what to do

790
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:16,270
so you don't do anything at all as

791
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:18,610
practitioners we have to do better than

792
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:21,639
that because when we remove people's

793
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:24,430
incentive to change behavior that we

794
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:28,420
really need to see changed

795
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:31,929
we basically stab ourselves right in the

796
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:33,700
heart as teams also we have to put our

797
00:34:31,929 --> 00:34:35,949
best face forward because if we don't

798
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:39,399
talk about our successes and the stuff

799
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:41,739
that we get to do well nobody else is

800
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,040
going to do it we can't just be the team

801
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:44,739
that

802
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,449
scrumpy that is overly political that

803
00:34:44,739 --> 00:34:49,509
doesn't get invited to play with Legos

804
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:52,299
or to go to parties because we tell too

805
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:54,760
many gloom and doom tales more than any

806
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,530
other job security requires us to

807
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,450
convince people to change their behavior

808
00:34:56,530 --> 00:35:01,150
if we're always good at social

809
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:04,470
engineering as we see we are we would

810
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:06,910
have already gotten all of this done

811
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:09,270
another thing that's really important is

812
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:12,270
to make sure we're marketing our work

813
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:16,150
lots of security folks hate marketing

814
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:19,780
sorry guys and gals security is a

815
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:23,260
marketing job fight me marketing teams

816
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:26,080
define identity they have to do all

817
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:28,870
kinds of things that look really really

818
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:31,750
close to monitoring alerting detection

819
00:35:28,870 --> 00:35:35,049
threat intelligence they just have to do

820
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:38,080
it differently marketing teams also have

821
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:40,810
to understand people how people pay

822
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:42,220
attention if people pay attention what

823
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:45,520
they're likely to read what they're not

824
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:48,209
going to read and generally how to get

825
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:50,820
attention and to get people to show up

826
00:35:48,210 --> 00:35:53,740
we could use some help on that front

827
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:55,660
definitely some days we have to be

828
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,859
better salesman and sales woman for the

829
00:35:55,660 --> 00:36:00,430
services that we provide our

830
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:02,560
organizations and we have to make sure

831
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:05,200
that when we are successful at something

832
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:07,060
or we can provide improvement or we can

833
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,089
bring something important to the table

834
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:12,880
we have that as our talking points and

835
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:14,740
we stick to them we nail them when we

836
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,600
repeat ourselves in the places where we

837
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:21,009
are successful it's not us just boasting

838
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:24,180
repetition is key to helping people

839
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:26,230
learn and key to helping people remember

840
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:28,240
another thing the marketing team will

841
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:30,070
teach you is you have to be really

842
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:32,410
cognizant of your audience and what's

843
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:34,630
gonna work for them most people's

844
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:38,279
attention spans are shorter than ever I

845
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:40,960
think right now if after about 11

846
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:43,870
seconds if the YouTube video isn't

847
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:46,750
entertaining enough people just skip on

848
00:36:43,870 --> 00:36:49,270
to the next one if you only have 11

849
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:51,910
seconds of someone's attention span if

850
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:53,860
you only have 11 seconds to get one

851
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:55,129
thing about your work to your

852
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:57,830
non-technical user

853
00:36:55,130 --> 00:37:00,740
or to your development team how are you

854
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:02,330
gonna use it first off you can't bury

855
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:04,430
the lead in any of your security

856
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:07,340
communications you have to be clear you

857
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:09,169
have to be concise go ask your marketing

858
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:11,900
call your marketing team about what a

859
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:13,640
good call-to-action looks like you have

860
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:15,710
to remember no one's gonna read a giant

861
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:18,620
wall of text there's a reason

862
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:21,880
bullet-points bolding things italicizing

863
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:24,520
things lots of arrows and emojis and

864
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:27,320
funding where you need attention are

865
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:29,300
what marketers do when they are trying

866
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:33,680
to part us from our money which they're

867
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:35,240
very good at by the way another thing to

868
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:38,390
remember if we're trying to market our

869
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:41,000
work and we are trying to make people

870
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:43,009
aware that we can be good colleagues and

871
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,680
collaborators we have to remember that

872
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:47,390
humor can be really powerful people will

873
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,620
remember when you make them laugh they

874
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,960
will make you remember when you make

875
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:52,940
them feel good and when you've made them

876
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,160
feel like they make a huge difference

877
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:57,950
and knowing how to help people connect

878
00:37:55,160 --> 00:38:00,920
especially over food with brown-bag

879
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:03,379
lunch with education opportunities with

880
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,970
silly games with throwing styrofoam

881
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:07,910
balls at each other just because it's a

882
00:38:04,970 --> 00:38:11,779
Friday that makes a huge difference and

883
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:13,730
then finally if we really want to win

884
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:16,700
more friends and we really want to

885
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:19,490
influence people we have to completely

886
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:23,419
just reject most of the status quo

887
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:25,580
around us I mentioned earlier my job is

888
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:27,500
the butt of a few jokes because I work

889
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:28,670
in blockchain land if you have

890
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,740
blockchain jokes I don't want to hear

891
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:32,660
them I've heard them all already here's

892
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:36,620
the thing about a decade ago when I

893
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:38,420
started working in technology I remember

894
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:42,500
when the cloud was the butt of

895
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:43,880
everyone's jokes except I don't know

896
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:47,030
about you guys

897
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:49,160
I just looked at amazon's market cap for

898
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:51,890
their web services we didn't criticize

899
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:54,200
the cloud out of existence the market

900
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:56,480
spoke the market keeps giving them more

901
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,980
and more and more money I'm not saying

902
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,390
that these blockchain kids are the cloud

903
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:01,400
I don't know what to do with these

904
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:05,000
things I just know how to protect people

905
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:07,880
from them but what I think is that if we

906
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:10,220
just keep persisting in this behave

907
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:12,440
here where we try to criticize things

908
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:15,078
out of existence not only are we not

909
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:17,119
going to get anywhere we're certainly

910
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:20,000
not going to solve any of the shadow IT

911
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:21,500
problems we have and no one's going to

912
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:24,319
listen to us when we're all running

913
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:26,240
around with our hair on fire at the next

914
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:29,359
thing that someone just slapped Internet

915
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:31,240
connectivity into the main reason we

916
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:34,700
should really be burning down our

917
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:37,069
isolationist security team mindset is

918
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:39,379
this there are seven billion human

919
00:39:37,069 --> 00:39:41,058
beings on this planet and many of those

920
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:43,069
people don't have the same education

921
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:46,579
experiences or access to the Internet

922
00:39:43,069 --> 00:39:49,519
that we do we are never ever going to

923
00:39:46,579 --> 00:39:51,109
get ahead of all of them and if we can't

924
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:53,450
beat them we should probably at least

925
00:39:51,109 --> 00:39:55,759
try to get them to join us we can't

926
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:58,509
afford to make any more enemies and we

927
00:39:55,759 --> 00:40:01,339
can't afford to alienate more people as

928
00:39:58,509 --> 00:40:02,839
teams we should always be recruiting we

929
00:40:01,339 --> 00:40:04,640
should be trying to distribute our

930
00:40:02,839 --> 00:40:06,920
workload we should be trying to make

931
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:09,170
sure that security is synonymous with

932
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:11,539
productivity and not slowing things down

933
00:40:09,170 --> 00:40:14,119
the secure way to do something should be

934
00:40:11,539 --> 00:40:17,059
the only productive way to do something

935
00:40:14,119 --> 00:40:19,730
period and we really have to make sure

936
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:21,410
that other people around us understand

937
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:23,059
that the blue team isn't just a bunch of

938
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:26,328
engineers who are grepping through code

939
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:28,490
and doing fancy things on github by the

940
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:31,730
way those new security advisories are

941
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:33,769
amazing but we should work to be

942
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:36,799
violently cross-functional with

943
00:40:33,769 --> 00:40:40,160
marketing with legal with HR with

944
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:44,240
anybody else who might be able to help

945
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:48,589
us do our main job which is to remove

946
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:50,359
fear remove uncertainty remove doubt and

947
00:40:48,589 --> 00:40:54,009
I don't know help people use stuff

948
00:40:50,359 --> 00:41:00,078
better and keep people from getting hurt

949
00:40:54,009 --> 00:41:03,319
finally I'm borrowing the conference

950
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:05,299
theme a little bit but it is really

951
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:07,279
dangerous to be a security team or a

952
00:41:05,299 --> 00:41:10,190
security practitioner who is out there

953
00:41:07,279 --> 00:41:12,710
working by yourself to accomplish things

954
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:15,170
on your own the concept of being a

955
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:17,809
single point of failure is part of our

956
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:20,180
core principles for a reason and too

957
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:21,150
many awful people win when we're at war

958
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:24,839
with one another

959
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:26,250
and that's not great the toxic community

960
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:28,350
in the industry and fighting that we

961
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:30,150
have doesn't get us anywhere it just

962
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:33,299
makes the criminals more successful and

963
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:35,850
the people who want us to not win get a

964
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:38,580
few more steps ahead of us our jobs

965
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:41,580
already hard enough anyway and lots of

966
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:45,090
us want to actually fix things we're not

967
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:48,870
quite sure how the price for all of this

968
00:41:45,090 --> 00:41:52,770
is working out we don't know if security

969
00:41:48,870 --> 00:41:53,430
problems are directly leading to people

970
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:56,370
dying

971
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:59,040
we have no idea but kind of feels like

972
00:41:56,370 --> 00:42:00,720
we're not far from that and that's not a

973
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:04,130
reality that I think any of us want to

974
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:07,410
have to wake up with one day and say

975
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:08,790
crap it really should have been nicer to

976
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:11,580
those other guys on the other side of

977
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:14,759
the building we have to have resiliency

978
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:16,980
we have to be able to recover when the

979
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:19,860
going gets tough and we have to make

980
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:22,320
sure we have other resources to back us

981
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:25,380
up when we need them the most

982
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:27,450
finally I have a couple of things I

983
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:29,970
always love to say but I will not read

984
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:32,299
them word to word for you generally

985
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:35,430
though we can't afford to isolate anyone

986
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:38,370
whether there are teams whether they are

987
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:40,169
marketers journalists people who use

988
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:42,930
technology people who want to throw

989
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:44,550
technology into the ocean we have to

990
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:47,700
figure out how to get along with

991
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:50,730
everyone and we have to be more

992
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:53,370
compatible with all kinds of people

993
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:54,990
coming from all kinds of places it's the

994
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:57,660
only way we're going to get people

995
00:42:54,990 --> 00:43:00,330
paying attention to the software we use

996
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:02,670
and the behaviors that we need to see

997
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:04,830
them practice no one's going to want to

998
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:06,960
hang out with you as a security team if

999
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:10,080
they've found out you've been talking

1000
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:13,080
crap about them if your users suspect

1001
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:15,480
that you think they're dumb they'll

1002
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:17,250
figure it out quickly if your users

1003
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:18,450
think that you don't care about them the

1004
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:20,880
first place they're gonna figure that

1005
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:23,759
out is how well you maintain your

1006
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,650
documentation and how you treat them

1007
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,900
when something breaks or when an

1008
00:43:25,650 --> 00:43:29,250
incident happens

1009
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,710
speaking poorly of the people who we are

1010
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:33,090
supposed to be protecting and defending

1011
00:43:30,710 --> 00:43:34,410
doesn't make us better and it doesn't

1012
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:37,920
make them safer

1013
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:40,140
and then finally I guess the real point

1014
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,160
of all of this talking I've been doing

1015
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:43,410
is pretty simple

1016
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:45,348
we have to change what we are doing as

1017
00:43:43,410 --> 00:43:48,089
an industry to be well-rounded

1018
00:43:45,349 --> 00:43:49,650
well-informed and much more emotionally

1019
00:43:48,089 --> 00:43:51,960
intelligent than we actually are

1020
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:53,910
dare I say we probably have to figure

1021
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:57,270
out what that empathy thing is if we

1022
00:43:53,910 --> 00:43:58,710
haven't done it already we need to be

1023
00:43:57,270 --> 00:43:59,280
able to embrace people from all over the

1024
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:01,980
place

1025
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:04,740
we have to recruit for diversity of

1026
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:08,160
experience for curiosity and we have to

1027
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:10,348
find people who want to do lifelong

1028
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,848
learning and who aren't exhausted every

1029
00:44:10,349 --> 00:44:14,430
time they have to go pick up a new

1030
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:16,349
language or a new tool or you know

1031
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:18,419
figure out what the hell os query did

1032
00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:21,089
the last time that it through a weird

1033
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:23,849
alert we have to stop digging our

1034
00:44:21,089 --> 00:44:26,279
collective feet in the sand code can be

1035
00:44:23,849 --> 00:44:28,799
learned we don't have to make everyone

1036
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:30,270
be a computer scientist when I was in

1037
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:32,038
college I looked at what they were

1038
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:35,130
trying to teach me and said no this is

1039
00:44:32,039 --> 00:44:37,950
crap no one's going to actually be using

1040
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:41,309
this by the time I go work in technology

1041
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:44,189
I wasn't wrong so I would like to summon

1042
00:44:41,309 --> 00:44:45,900
18 year old me back and find out what

1043
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:48,690
other what brilliant things she had

1044
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:50,490
going on in her brain but the technology

1045
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:53,160
that I work on didn't exist a decade ago

1046
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:55,950
the language that we use to write it go

1047
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:57,319
maybe seven or eight years old wasn't

1048
00:44:55,950 --> 00:45:00,299
around when I was in university either

1049
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:01,770
I'm not a good engineer because I went

1050
00:45:00,299 --> 00:45:04,349
to college and learned it I'm a good

1051
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:06,299
engineer because I know I don't know

1052
00:45:04,349 --> 00:45:08,609
everything but I'm willing to at least

1053
00:45:06,299 --> 00:45:11,609
try to figure it out and I want to be

1054
00:45:08,609 --> 00:45:16,828
surrounded with people like me who will

1055
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:18,720
do the same thing thank you very much

1056
00:45:16,829 --> 00:45:21,350
for listening to me rant until lots and

1057
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:25,738
lots of security stories

1058
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:25,739
[Applause]

1059
00:45:27,270 --> 00:45:30,900
Thank You Jessie a wonderful call to

1060
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:32,099
arms therefore people are inspired by

1061
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,589
what you say and they want to go back to

1062
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:37,950
their workplaces not tomorrow that same

1063
00:45:34,589 --> 00:45:39,839
Monday and implement but what a three

1064
00:45:37,950 --> 00:45:41,970
short sharp bits of advice people can do

1065
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:44,339
real things they can do to move towards

1066
00:45:41,970 --> 00:45:47,790
those goals that you'll know so there's

1067
00:45:44,339 --> 00:45:50,490
a few different things for one start

1068
00:45:47,790 --> 00:45:52,500
looking for ways that you can partner

1069
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:54,060
with other teams and you can use

1070
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,670
projects that they're working on to

1071
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:58,830
drive your security goals you can throw

1072
00:45:56,670 --> 00:46:01,200
out your security roadmap and say okay

1073
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:03,540
never let a good crisis go to wait there

1074
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:06,660
are two crises where we can make this

1075
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:09,509
one thing we want to do happen much

1076
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:11,759
faster than we even planned on another

1077
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:14,240
thing we can do is to make sure that we

1078
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,650
are fun and welcoming and inviting

1079
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,598
having snacks in your corner is actually

1080
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:21,450
a good thing because people get hungry

1081
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:23,670
people forget their lunch and people

1082
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:25,859
really really really like chocolate or

1083
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:27,660
beef jerky and then finally just

1084
00:46:25,859 --> 00:46:29,720
thinking about how we talk to other

1085
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:31,830
people and making sure that we are using

1086
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:34,348
inclusive language we're not using

1087
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:35,910
jargon when we're talking to you know an

1088
00:46:34,349 --> 00:46:38,180
administrative assistant we are

1089
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:41,009
explaining things in very human terms

1090
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:43,290
people's eyeballs glaze over when we

1091
00:46:41,010 --> 00:46:45,330
start talking about encryption and all

1092
00:46:43,290 --> 00:46:47,730
of these protocols and the alphabet soup

1093
00:46:45,330 --> 00:46:49,740
of technology we got to do better and at

1094
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:52,140
least give them something tangible to

1095
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:53,819
work with chocolate or beef jerky that's

1096
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,950
my takeaway there give her a round of

1097
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:59,990
applause grab your little Zelda chess

1098
00:46:55,950 --> 00:47:02,609
set on the way Jesse great start yeah

1099
00:46:59,990 --> 00:47:05,430
the wonderful Jesse omen there from

1100
00:47:02,609 --> 00:47:07,319
tender mint our next speaker just before

1101
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:09,660
I introduce our our final speaker before

1102
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:11,940
morning tea this afternoon when we wrap

1103
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:13,680
up also if this is your first one but

1104
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:15,480
dope with the famous asserts speed

1105
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:18,029
debate if you haven't seen it before

1106
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:20,490
it's absolute mental mayhem here on the

1107
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:22,650
stage as nine speakers knock over six

1108
00:47:20,490 --> 00:47:24,118
debate topics in the course of about

1109
00:47:22,650 --> 00:47:26,040
forty minutes speaking for one minute

1110
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:28,290
each on each topic its truth bombs

1111
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,960
there's a bit of fun really interesting

1112
00:47:28,290 --> 00:47:33,750
not deep dive very quick dive into a

1113
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,920
duck half a dozen big issues facing the

1114
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:36,990
issue that's the speed debated about

1115
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,660
3:45 this afternoon our next speaker

1116
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:41,100
from the wonderful people at mine cast

1117
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:43,350
sponsors of also we could do

1118
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:46,319
them please give Garrett ohhara a big

1119
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:51,240
round of applause oils Garrett thanks

1120
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:52,710
Adam morning everybody we did on

1121
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:54,299
Wednesday I was chatting to the co fence

1122
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:55,560
guys about how this would go and we

1123
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:58,230
thought maybe mom cash should have

1124
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:59,580
sponsored travel pillows and McDonald's

1125
00:47:58,230 --> 00:48:02,010
and instead of me talk and the guys

1126
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:05,160
played whale song just to get over last

1127
00:48:02,010 --> 00:48:07,920
night but thanks for for coming along so

1128
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:09,720
I work in mime cast and it's part of my

1129
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:11,850
job I get to talk to folks like

1130
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:14,040
yourselves about security all the time

1131
00:48:11,850 --> 00:48:16,680
so we talk about the security stack we

1132
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:18,240
talk about instant response seems or all

1133
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:21,870
that kind of stuff but the conversation

1134
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:23,970
over the last 18 months two years seems

1135
00:48:21,870 --> 00:48:25,710
to always come back to humans and a

1136
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:27,180
couple of things that actually jesse has

1137
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:28,440
has kind of already spoken about I'm

1138
00:48:27,180 --> 00:48:32,819
kind of gonna do a bit of a deep dive

1139
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:35,250
into that so given it's about humans I

1140
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:38,430
kind of want to start with some biology

1141
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:41,460
and specifically the notion of defensive

1142
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:43,109
reactivity which is basically something

1143
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,400
that happens in your amygdala or your

1144
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:46,080
lizard brain it's probably how you guys

1145
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:48,570
would know it and it's the thing that's

1146
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:51,600
when we didn't live in sort of safe

1147
00:48:48,570 --> 00:48:53,370
environments like offices or you know go

1148
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:54,839
to the Marriott hotel for conferences

1149
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:57,299
back when we were on the planes we had

1150
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:59,670
to fight saber-tooth Tigers and wooly

1151
00:48:57,300 --> 00:49:01,890
mammoths it's essentially our emergency

1152
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:05,790
response system and it's the thing that

1153
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:07,410
protected us so the important thing here

1154
00:49:05,790 --> 00:49:08,820
really is that it's an instinctual thing

1155
00:49:07,410 --> 00:49:10,710
it's not something anyone intentionally

1156
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:13,590
chooses it just happens when there's a

1157
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:16,350
perceived threat we this thing this

1158
00:49:13,590 --> 00:49:18,840
thing happens to us you will see things

1159
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:20,299
like raised cortisol levels your heart

1160
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:23,820
rate will go up blood flow will increase

1161
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:25,860
so it's the kind of flight or flight

1162
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:27,330
response your alerts you're gonna run

1163
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:29,280
faster you're probably gonna be able to

1164
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:30,569
fight better than you would normally but

1165
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,870
what you probably don't to do is sit

1166
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:35,520
down to do like Sudoku or crosswords or

1167
00:49:33,870 --> 00:49:37,410
those kind of things and you can't

1168
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:39,600
control this but it's responsible for

1169
00:49:37,410 --> 00:49:42,649
many of the issues that we see in terms

1170
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:45,779
of that user awareness the change in

1171
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:48,830
end-user behavior some of which Jesse

1172
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:51,690
spoke to already so ultimately

1173
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:54,529
negativity causes defensiveness and

1174
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:58,170
defensive people can't really hear

1175
00:49:54,530 --> 00:50:00,809
so humans are awful now by that I don't

1176
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:03,329
mean if people flew in which many of us

1177
00:50:00,809 --> 00:50:04,980
did that we took the armrest from the

1178
00:50:03,329 --> 00:50:07,400
person that said in the middle row or

1179
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:09,750
that we put the toilet paper so it rolls

1180
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,099
to the inside against the wall instead

1181
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:13,650
of outside which is what everybody

1182
00:50:11,099 --> 00:50:15,990
should be doing really mean more in

1183
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:19,049
terms of the inbuilt things that we have

1184
00:50:15,990 --> 00:50:21,629
as humans that can affect how we do

1185
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:23,250
things like communicate so often what we

1186
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:24,540
say we think we've said one thing but

1187
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:27,780
what's being understood is something

1188
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:28,829
else we have to make assumptions if you

1189
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,970
didn't make assumptions you would go

1190
00:50:28,829 --> 00:50:32,790
crazy right there's so much information

1191
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:34,290
that flows in in any given day that you

1192
00:50:32,790 --> 00:50:36,839
really have to be able to do that to

1193
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:38,308
survive in the world the flipside is

1194
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:40,440
that it actually also causes problems

1195
00:50:38,309 --> 00:50:42,329
sometimes in terms of the assumptions

1196
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:43,859
that we make things like the

1197
00:50:42,329 --> 00:50:46,260
dunning-kruger effect which has been

1198
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:48,480
much publicized over the last few years

1199
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:50,849
so that notion that if you're really

1200
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,369
confident about something it often

1201
00:50:50,849 --> 00:50:55,290
correlates to a lack of skill or

1202
00:50:53,369 --> 00:50:56,660
competence sometimes and I'm sure

1203
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:59,069
everyone's probably experienced the

1204
00:50:56,660 --> 00:51:01,078
senior leadership where you see massive

1205
00:50:59,069 --> 00:51:02,759
amount of confidence but actually not a

1206
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:05,160
whole lot of competence sometimes so

1207
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,290
it's kind of fairly common thing but

1208
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:09,598
ultimately it's about emotions and the

1209
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:11,579
fact that's I feel like we've had too

1210
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:14,819
much to drink if we had a late night

1211
00:51:11,579 --> 00:51:15,960
it's not enough caffeine or sleep that

1212
00:51:14,819 --> 00:51:18,299
we're going to be affected emotionally

1213
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:20,579
by that stuff and that plays into many

1214
00:51:18,299 --> 00:51:22,740
different things so things like our

1215
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:25,799
ability to make decisions and good

1216
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:28,558
decisions or understand things like risk

1217
00:51:25,799 --> 00:51:31,859
and these amazingly enthusiastic guys

1218
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:33,710
who having a barbecue and also wanted to

1219
00:51:31,859 --> 00:51:36,390
be in the paddle pool at the same time

1220
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:39,630
if you think about the average security

1221
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:41,368
person a sea so going into a cinchy

1222
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:43,260
complex operating environments of

1223
00:51:41,369 --> 00:51:46,589
companies that may have may have been

1224
00:51:43,260 --> 00:51:48,869
around for decades where legacy systems

1225
00:51:46,589 --> 00:51:50,970
have got their tentacles in to all the

1226
00:51:48,869 --> 00:51:52,920
sort of business operations that's a

1227
00:51:50,970 --> 00:51:54,118
really hard operating environments you

1228
00:51:52,920 --> 00:51:58,200
operate in and to make good decisions

1229
00:51:54,119 --> 00:52:01,049
and being human doesn't help us change

1230
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:03,540
is hard at a personal level anyone who's

1231
00:52:01,049 --> 00:52:04,890
ever given up cigarettes Beck it's a

1232
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:06,480
nightmare that thing we're at a

1233
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:07,350
conference like this be go ahead side

1234
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,190
and

1235
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:12,509
have a cigarette and talk to people and

1236
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:15,000
it's a hard thing to give away it's a

1237
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:18,300
known pattern it's safe it feels good at

1238
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:20,520
an organizational level similar stuff we

1239
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,080
we kind of know what works and changing

1240
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:23,670
sometimes is hard because often there's

1241
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:25,890
that dip in productivity in the short

1242
00:52:23,670 --> 00:52:27,900
term for an outcome that maybe is

1243
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:29,400
understood but is also kind of a bet

1244
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:32,010
because it's never binary it's never

1245
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:33,810
it's going to work it's always we think

1246
00:52:32,010 --> 00:52:36,810
it's gonna work so that stuff is hard

1247
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:38,070
too I'm gonna really focus today on the

1248
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:39,630
communication side of things because

1249
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:41,040
that really is where the conversations

1250
00:52:39,630 --> 00:52:43,080
that I've been having lately

1251
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,900
seem to land all the time and the notion

1252
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:47,460
that again as humans we get things wrong

1253
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,930
you know we we we think we're being

1254
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:51,120
understood but actually when you when

1255
00:52:48,930 --> 00:52:52,890
you sort of talk to people they haven't

1256
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,970
really understood what you've said we

1257
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:56,160
choose the wrong modes of communication

1258
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:59,759
we choose the wrong cut the language

1259
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:02,970
that we use and these things are all

1260
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,950
related so how they play together is

1261
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:06,390
reasonably well understood you need to

1262
00:53:04,950 --> 00:53:09,810
make good decisions and kind of

1263
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:11,190
understand how we are as humans after

1264
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:13,650
those decisions have been made they need

1265
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:15,330
to be communicated well for change to be

1266
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:20,060
effective and essentially you see the

1267
00:53:15,330 --> 00:53:22,440
beautiful circle of life take place so

1268
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:24,450
starting we're looking at communicating

1269
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:26,730
up or across depending on where you are

1270
00:53:24,450 --> 00:53:28,649
within an organization and I think this

1271
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:31,170
reflects some of what Jessie is sort of

1272
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:33,420
spoken to you already and the notion

1273
00:53:31,170 --> 00:53:36,240
that quite often when we are trying to

1274
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:38,580
get buy-in for projects and spend on

1275
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:40,950
technology really any change or program

1276
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:43,290
of works in cybersecurity you hear

1277
00:53:40,950 --> 00:53:45,839
comments like Miko yesterday where he

1278
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:48,270
asked the board asked him why they were

1279
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:49,680
spending 50 thousand euros on security

1280
00:53:48,270 --> 00:53:51,450
when they didn't have a security problem

1281
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:52,980
and the you know the comment and we

1282
00:53:51,450 --> 00:53:55,259
don't have a cleaning problem so why

1283
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:57,180
should we pay for cleaners that points

1284
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:59,280
to the problem here I think Michael also

1285
00:53:57,180 --> 00:54:01,830
commented there was a question something

1286
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:03,480
like are we secure and that's obviously

1287
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:06,060
an impossible question to answer but it

1288
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:09,390
points to a disconnect in communication

1289
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:12,509
a big part of that is the language that

1290
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:15,089
we use so we obviously in this industry

1291
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:16,800
have our vernacular have our almost like

1292
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:18,210
it's not slang but it's the things we

1293
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:19,850
use to communicate and it seems

1294
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:24,740
cross-site scripting

1295
00:54:19,850 --> 00:54:26,060
see v's vulnerabilities all the language

1296
00:54:24,740 --> 00:54:29,359
and the things that we say in a kind of

1297
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:31,820
daily basis if I'm a business on the

1298
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:34,070
business side and Finance or on a board

1299
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:36,020
I that's not my language my language is

1300
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:38,030
productivity it's the pl it's

1301
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:40,520
shareholder value it's risk mitigation

1302
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:43,280
and and there's definitely a disconnect

1303
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:45,110
there and you see that

1304
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,240
tinium did a report on this stuff and

1305
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:48,860
the board members for some of the most

1306
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:52,580
highly vulnerable companies when they

1307
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:54,710
responded to their survey didn't know or

1308
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:57,170
weren't able to interpret cybersecurity

1309
00:54:54,710 --> 00:54:58,910
reports so this is a kind of a

1310
00:54:57,170 --> 00:55:02,060
well-established problem that exists

1311
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:04,460
within the industry I'm going to point

1312
00:55:02,060 --> 00:55:07,340
to this book if you guys haven't read it

1313
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:08,540
I highly recommend it it's by Phil

1314
00:55:07,340 --> 00:55:10,280
dongho he came from governance

1315
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:11,540
background but has written honestly one

1316
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:14,390
of the best books in terms of cyber

1317
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:16,700
resilience that I've seen and he talks

1318
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:19,430
to this this notion of how do you

1319
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:22,970
communicate and and what's useful for a

1320
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:25,430
boards to to understand cybersecurity so

1321
00:55:22,970 --> 00:55:29,569
he talks about things like an ambiguous

1322
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:31,490
and relatable information for a board it

1323
00:55:29,570 --> 00:55:33,530
tooks about aligning the conversations

1324
00:55:31,490 --> 00:55:35,629
who are board with business outcomes and

1325
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:36,980
business strategy and obviously that

1326
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:39,290
encompasses the you know the crown

1327
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:40,850
jewels the high-value digital assets but

1328
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:43,250
ultimately it has to be a business

1329
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:46,339
conversation not a server security or

1330
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:49,750
technology conversation at the notion of

1331
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:51,800
pointless metrics is another big one so

1332
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:53,390
like we see we see the thing where

1333
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:56,510
people will report in our industry

1334
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:58,339
sometimes on the number of spam messages

1335
00:55:56,510 --> 00:56:00,740
spam messages that are blocked per

1336
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:02,030
quarter or per month and it's a big

1337
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:03,770
number often so you know it could be

1338
00:56:02,030 --> 00:56:06,800
five million ten million ten million

1339
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:08,720
messages is that good or is it bad if

1340
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:10,040
I'm a business after I sit in the

1341
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:12,140
business side of things I don't really

1342
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:14,480
know what's the impact if that number

1343
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:16,700
went up or went down so making sure that

1344
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:18,230
the metrics that are used are not

1345
00:56:16,700 --> 00:56:20,240
pointless is is obviously fairly

1346
00:56:18,230 --> 00:56:23,240
critical but ultimately it's about being

1347
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:25,399
brief be concise but being relevance to

1348
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:27,669
the business in the communications to

1349
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,670
the board

1350
00:56:27,740 --> 00:56:32,450
the other side of the fence then is when

1351
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:35,930
you're not communicating up or across is

1352
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:38,569
the conversation to end users and Jessie

1353
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:40,129
cover this pretty well I think I'm gonna

1354
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:42,230
echo a lot of what she said

1355
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:44,270
the these are the people who sit on the

1356
00:56:42,230 --> 00:56:45,470
front desk they sit in hate your they

1357
00:56:44,270 --> 00:56:48,080
drive the trucks they're working

1358
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:49,759
logistics finance legal whatever it is

1359
00:56:48,080 --> 00:56:52,520
they're not us they're the the other

1360
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:55,490
people and there's really two sides I

1361
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:58,009
believe to the issue here the first one

1362
00:56:55,490 --> 00:56:59,750
is that we get the a couple of things

1363
00:56:58,010 --> 00:57:02,210
wrong so we have people who are experts

1364
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:05,630
in security CISOs InfoSec personnel

1365
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:07,490
security experts who are brilliant at

1366
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:09,400
their jobs but then they're forced into

1367
00:57:07,490 --> 00:57:11,959
the I think Jessie gold and squishy

1368
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:14,120
skills the the notion that they don't

1369
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:16,190
have to somehow be really really good at

1370
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:18,049
this other thing which is communication

1371
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:21,080
and I think that's kind of unfair and

1372
00:57:18,050 --> 00:57:23,570
it's generally not very effective we

1373
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:25,610
choose interesting modes of

1374
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:28,370
communication we left a little handout

1375
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:32,150
there the little page which is an

1376
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:33,589
example of a security email bulletin the

1377
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:37,610
things that get sent around quite often

1378
00:57:33,590 --> 00:57:40,910
on a monthly basis and I would question

1379
00:57:37,610 --> 00:57:42,560
their effectiveness as the reality it's

1380
00:57:40,910 --> 00:57:44,629
something that often is has to be done

1381
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:47,060
for compliance reasons but there are

1382
00:57:44,630 --> 00:57:48,740
better modes of communication that are

1383
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:50,810
available to us now things like video

1384
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:53,120
things like potentially face to face or

1385
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:54,920
instructor-led training but that's kind

1386
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:57,140
of where the the conversation needs to

1387
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:59,210
you to go to and really important that

1388
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:02,000
we kind of start to drop the jargon and

1389
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:04,210
we use punchy messaging that will cut

1390
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,740
through to to the folks who are

1391
00:58:04,210 --> 00:58:08,720
generally just not as interested and

1392
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:11,450
don't care as much as we think they do

1393
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:14,140
so these are people who are extremely

1394
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:16,220
busy they have their boss who always

1395
00:58:14,140 --> 00:58:17,870
annoyed with them because the 10 things

1396
00:58:16,220 --> 00:58:20,209
they were expected to do haven't been

1397
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:21,830
done so they've they've got office

1398
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:23,840
politics they've just got so much other

1399
00:58:21,830 --> 00:58:26,509
stuff going on that when that email

1400
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:28,820
arrives in do they care they honestly

1401
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:30,290
generally don't and that's where we

1402
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:33,380
start to kind of run into problems and

1403
00:58:30,290 --> 00:58:35,060
we end up with this guy and Jesse's

1404
00:58:33,380 --> 00:58:37,130
gonna mention the the idiot you know the

1405
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:39,020
idiots notion I've heard some really

1406
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:40,460
funny metrics within security teams

1407
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:40,980
they're kind of amusing they don't get

1408
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:43,260
shared with the

1409
00:58:40,980 --> 00:58:46,109
weiter team so one of them was the clan

1410
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:48,450
rate at the muppet metric various

1411
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:51,000
variations on the users being kind of

1412
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:53,069
silly people who don't really kind of

1413
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:55,050
get this stuff and I'm gonna challenge

1414
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:57,060
that and say that actually it's not on

1415
00:58:55,050 --> 00:58:59,820
them it's kind of on us and we've used

1416
00:58:57,060 --> 00:59:01,830
really ineffective communications who an

1417
00:58:59,820 --> 00:59:04,770
audience that is really generally pretty

1418
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:07,819
disinterested and I believe that comes

1419
00:59:04,770 --> 00:59:10,050
from the notion of compliance we're

1420
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:12,840
really what we've done is a box-ticking

1421
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:15,000
exercise we've got a requirement to

1422
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:18,990
maybe have 95 percent of people watch

1423
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:20,130
the LMS video on security so generally

1424
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:21,868
what they will do if they're anything

1425
00:59:20,130 --> 00:59:23,670
like me is they'll play the video on

1426
00:59:21,869 --> 00:59:24,840
their second string and then on the

1427
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:27,600
primary stream they'll just continue

1428
00:59:24,840 --> 00:59:28,800
working the little box pops up to say

1429
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:31,770
you know do you accept that you've

1430
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:33,690
completed this module - yes and you go

1431
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:36,900
about your day but nothing has actually

1432
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:39,240
changed and I think we need to be much

1433
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:42,119
more aligned with a behavior change

1434
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:45,180
model and that's much more messy it's

1435
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:47,070
not as clean but it does use a motion to

1436
00:59:45,180 --> 00:59:49,169
cut through to get to the end users and

1437
00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:50,940
I echo the the use of the advertising

1438
00:59:49,170 --> 00:59:53,160
approach that works we know that works

1439
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:55,140
if you think about the advertising

1440
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:57,839
industry they're masters at getting us

1441
00:59:55,140 --> 00:59:59,460
to buy things or change behavior they

1442
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:00,930
would never use what's on your table

1443
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:05,430
there which is a wall of text that just

1444
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:07,770
doesn't work that way this isn't a

1445
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:10,500
cybersecurity problem this is very much

1446
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:12,660
a human problem where you have important

1447
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:15,420
information being transmitted to a

1448
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:17,700
completely disinterested audience so

1449
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:19,109
that could be back and I smoked I would

1450
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:20,759
probably do exactly what that guy is

1451
01:00:19,109 --> 01:00:22,230
doing because there was times where I

1452
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:25,350
really really really just wanted a

1453
01:00:22,230 --> 01:00:26,970
cigarette the little old lady's tard

1454
01:00:25,350 --> 01:00:29,190
she's not gonna see that wet paint sign

1455
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:30,270
she's tard it's not part of part of

1456
01:00:29,190 --> 01:00:33,000
what's important to her in that given

1457
01:00:30,270 --> 01:00:34,230
moments or the the Beamer driver I still

1458
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:37,260
don't really know how that happens but

1459
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:41,970
there you go so this is a human problem

1460
01:00:37,260 --> 01:00:44,550
and and that's kind of where we are this

1461
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:47,009
is this is Leo the Labradoodle he's

1462
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:49,310
actually my friends and colleague Ryan's

1463
01:00:47,010 --> 01:00:51,540
dog he lives in Melbourne with Ryan and

1464
01:00:49,310 --> 01:00:53,160
he's you can see here he's way more

1465
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:54,580
successful than I've ever been on social

1466
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:56,259
media he's got

1467
01:00:54,580 --> 01:00:57,490
1300 followers and this is a few months

1468
01:00:56,260 --> 01:00:59,980
old so he's probably doing even more

1469
01:00:57,490 --> 01:01:02,859
than that now but this is the world we

1470
01:00:59,980 --> 01:01:04,390
live in where employees don't just have

1471
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:06,370
their own social media Ken's but I know

1472
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:09,250
many people who have their pets on

1473
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:10,359
things like on Instagram and they have

1474
01:01:09,250 --> 01:01:11,890
their own accounts they've got their own

1475
01:01:10,360 --> 01:01:13,900
followers and that's that's kind of

1476
01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:16,870
where we're at so what we're actually

1477
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:20,410
competing with is these dopamine hitters

1478
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:22,359
the 11 seconds YouTube video thing that

1479
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:24,100
that's what we're competing with but yet

1480
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:26,800
we're still sending out emails that are

1481
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:29,440
just dry boring and will never resonate

1482
01:01:26,800 --> 01:01:31,300
with the end users so you've got

1483
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:34,330
snapchat Facebook Instagram you know

1484
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:35,830
Skype and Twitter people probably have

1485
01:01:34,330 --> 01:01:37,870
mobile phones sitting on their desks

1486
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:39,430
that's gonna beep when a new message

1487
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:41,560
comes in on the friends group in

1488
01:01:39,430 --> 01:01:43,509
whatsapp and or if somebody likes the

1489
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:45,850
photo of the sandwich that they ate for

1490
01:01:43,510 --> 01:01:48,490
lunch but those things are constantly

1491
01:01:45,850 --> 01:01:49,779
happening so not only do you have really

1492
01:01:48,490 --> 01:01:52,330
important information that you need to

1493
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:54,280
get through to a disinterested audience

1494
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:56,650
but they're also massively distracted

1495
01:01:54,280 --> 01:02:03,490
and what you don't have is people who

1496
01:01:56,650 --> 01:02:05,380
look like this and there you go so

1497
01:02:03,490 --> 01:02:06,580
there's probably some people who know

1498
01:02:05,380 --> 01:02:07,420
exactly what happened there and then

1499
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:09,610
there's a bunch of people who are

1500
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:11,500
wondering why did people throw airplanes

1501
01:02:09,610 --> 01:02:12,820
we actually changed it normally we have

1502
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:14,170
people just roll them into balls and

1503
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:15,520
throw them at this stage so it looks

1504
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:18,370
like they're kind of really not digging

1505
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:21,490
the talk that little sheet of paper on

1506
01:02:18,370 --> 01:02:23,020
your on your table one of the bullet

1507
01:02:21,490 --> 01:02:24,669
points near the end says something along

1508
01:02:23,020 --> 01:02:27,310
the lines of if you throw a paper

1509
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:31,240
airplane onto the stage we actually have

1510
01:02:27,310 --> 01:02:35,259
a winner here that you have the option

1511
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:37,089
to win $100 Visa card so we have a

1512
01:02:35,260 --> 01:02:39,070
winner which is Shane Madison wherever

1513
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:42,250
you are come and see me

1514
01:02:39,070 --> 01:02:44,640
nice job Shane yeah random applause that

1515
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:44,640
was awesome

1516
01:02:49,890 --> 01:02:54,609
so like the point of that is just like

1517
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:56,380
it's a it's a funny thing but that's

1518
01:02:54,609 --> 01:02:58,359
what happens every single time some

1519
01:02:56,380 --> 01:03:00,910
people will have read it most people

1520
01:02:58,359 --> 01:03:03,250
won't and that's kind of the the issue

1521
01:03:00,910 --> 01:03:05,140
in a lot of these comms so we still talk

1522
01:03:03,250 --> 01:03:07,150
with Dan Gregory from the grew and

1523
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:08,799
transfer or The Impossible Institute

1524
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:10,599
last year at the the AZ conference

1525
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:13,720
actually who are supporters of all sorts

1526
01:03:10,599 --> 01:03:15,460
and he used one of the best analogies

1527
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:18,060
I've seen for our industry which is the

1528
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:21,010
the thing where you get on a plane and

1529
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:22,089
the airlines legally are required to

1530
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:24,250
tell you this really important

1531
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:25,328
information that may save your life but

1532
01:03:24,250 --> 01:03:27,430
when people get on the plane what

1533
01:03:25,329 --> 01:03:29,470
they're really thinking about is the

1534
01:03:27,430 --> 01:03:31,720
Long Island iced tea they'll have in the

1535
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:33,759
swim bar in Thailand or that the

1536
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:35,230
airplane pulled away from the gate a

1537
01:03:33,760 --> 01:03:36,490
couple of minutes late so they're maybe

1538
01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:39,010
going to be late for their meeting or

1539
01:03:36,490 --> 01:03:41,049
will the kids go feral and or will they

1540
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:43,569
watch the entertainment system but it's

1541
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:46,599
that rather than tensing the number of

1542
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:48,250
rows to the exit which may be behind you

1543
01:03:46,599 --> 01:03:50,589
people don't pay attention so it's a

1544
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:53,050
perfect analogy for our industry a

1545
01:03:50,589 --> 01:03:55,540
completely disinterested audience really

1546
01:03:53,050 --> 01:03:57,819
important information what you saw was

1547
01:03:55,540 --> 01:03:59,589
this transformation where organizations

1548
01:03:57,819 --> 01:04:01,930
like Virgin Atlantic started becoming

1549
01:03:59,589 --> 01:04:04,509
much more informal they introduced kind

1550
01:04:01,930 --> 01:04:06,490
of cartoony safety booklets in the back

1551
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:08,380
of seats and all the sudden people

1552
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:10,419
started becoming engaged and it evolved

1553
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:13,510
to the point where you have barely

1554
01:04:10,420 --> 01:04:16,270
concealed nudity so this is error New

1555
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:19,270
Zealand air this is body paint so that

1556
01:04:16,270 --> 01:04:22,480
guy was actually naked same exact legal

1557
01:04:19,270 --> 01:04:23,589
requirements but now built into a kind

1558
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:26,560
of much more consumable

1559
01:04:23,589 --> 01:04:28,210
and memorable format and I feel okay

1560
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:30,490
with having a nipple on the screen given

1561
01:04:28,210 --> 01:04:32,230
that Miko basically said the full

1562
01:04:30,490 --> 01:04:34,209
version of mofos yesterday and there was

1563
01:04:32,230 --> 01:04:36,010
a naked person on this the previous

1564
01:04:34,210 --> 01:04:40,030
slide I was looking like should we do

1565
01:04:36,010 --> 01:04:40,930
this but this is where we go you can see

1566
01:04:40,030 --> 01:04:42,970
how this works

1567
01:04:40,930 --> 01:04:44,140
so there's some some considerations here

1568
01:04:42,970 --> 01:04:46,720
in terms that have this all ties

1569
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:48,520
together the comms to end users like

1570
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:51,310
there's things to think about the

1571
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:53,290
cadence of communications you want it to

1572
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:55,599
be look at our experience around monthly

1573
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:56,980
is good if it goes too often it starts

1574
01:04:55,599 --> 01:04:57,610
to become part of the noise that people

1575
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:59,380
just

1576
01:04:57,610 --> 01:05:02,650
you kind of eliminate and ignore every

1577
01:04:59,380 --> 01:05:05,440
kind of every time they see it the mode

1578
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:06,910
needs to be correct so it could be an

1579
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:09,250
email but the email needs to be written

1580
01:05:06,910 --> 01:05:11,080
in a way to Jessi's point it uses bold

1581
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:12,550
it's got a you know a single punchy

1582
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:14,680
message that is actionable and that

1583
01:05:12,550 --> 01:05:17,860
people will remember rather than long

1584
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:19,210
verbose emails that are full of kind of

1585
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:22,330
technical jargon they just they don't

1586
01:05:19,210 --> 01:05:24,880
work things like short videos generally

1587
01:05:22,330 --> 01:05:27,250
humor is incredibly incredibly good at

1588
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:30,550
cutting through again pointing to the

1589
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:33,460
advertising industry how often do the

1590
01:05:30,550 --> 01:05:35,290
ads that we remember use humor for us to

1591
01:05:33,460 --> 01:05:38,740
kind of relate to them that's a fairly

1592
01:05:35,290 --> 01:05:41,020
common approach and what you want to get

1593
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:43,839
to is the the state where you've created

1594
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:45,970
social norms within the organization

1595
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:48,220
that you're in or or tournament change

1596
01:05:45,970 --> 01:05:50,169
within where people will look to the

1597
01:05:48,220 --> 01:05:51,669
leadership and that's that's absolutely

1598
01:05:50,170 --> 01:05:53,170
critical by the way you need the

1599
01:05:51,670 --> 01:05:55,540
leadership board into this stuff because

1600
01:05:53,170 --> 01:05:56,770
if they're not the employees will just

1601
01:05:55,540 --> 01:06:00,100
look at them and say well if they're not

1602
01:05:56,770 --> 01:06:01,210
doing it why should I so what you want

1603
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:02,589
to get to you is you look at the

1604
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:05,140
leadership you look left you look right

1605
01:06:02,590 --> 01:06:06,820
and employees realize that if they step

1606
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:09,850
away from their laptops they should hit

1607
01:06:06,820 --> 01:06:11,710
Windows L they shouldn't let people walk

1608
01:06:09,850 --> 01:06:14,110
through the turnstile right behind them

1609
01:06:11,710 --> 01:06:15,910
they shouldn't click on every single

1610
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:17,980
link in every single email that comes

1611
01:06:15,910 --> 01:06:20,170
through even for companies that they're

1612
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:22,060
not the customer of but you build up

1613
01:06:20,170 --> 01:06:25,690
those social norms within your

1614
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:28,750
organization so I'm gonna kind of close

1615
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:31,330
that with this notion of advertising and

1616
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:32,940
I was talking to a guy called Lachlan on

1617
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:35,290
Wednesday who may or may not be here

1618
01:06:32,940 --> 01:06:37,270
about this and we got into a

1619
01:06:35,290 --> 01:06:40,390
conversation about Guinness so I thought

1620
01:06:37,270 --> 01:06:43,450
it was a good one to include here in

1621
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:45,220
terms of advertising I'm from Ireland so

1622
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:47,710
I love Guiness but if I ever had an

1623
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:50,020
advertisement sent to me like this I'm

1624
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:52,240
really just gonna zone out I don't care

1625
01:06:50,020 --> 01:06:54,790
it's to draw it's to word it's never

1626
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:56,799
gonna change my mind but if you consider

1627
01:06:54,790 --> 01:06:59,140
something like this and I'm guessing

1628
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:01,120
Australians may probably remember this

1629
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:04,810
guy the Emperor nasi goreng see some

1630
01:07:01,120 --> 01:07:06,670
kind of smiles and some nods you know

1631
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:08,650
this is the guy who told his kid that

1632
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:10,510
the Great Wall of China was built to

1633
01:07:08,650 --> 01:07:11,330
keep the rabbits out and it was built by

1634
01:07:10,510 --> 01:07:13,550
Emperor Nancy gore

1635
01:07:11,330 --> 01:07:15,860
like it was a silly sort of funny odd

1636
01:07:13,550 --> 01:07:18,170
and everybody probably remembers have

1637
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:19,550
human and relatable it was the little

1638
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:20,900
kid at the end kind of ruffling his hair

1639
01:07:19,550 --> 01:07:23,180
about to get up in front of his class

1640
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:26,060
and give the talk in the Great Wall of

1641
01:07:23,180 --> 01:07:28,970
China it cuts through we all remember

1642
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:31,730
that or this lady Deborah Kennedy back

1643
01:07:28,970 --> 01:07:34,669
in 2000's who uttered the now infamous

1644
01:07:31,730 --> 01:07:36,650
words not happy John and they're part of

1645
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:37,940
our vernacular they've become something

1646
01:07:36,650 --> 01:07:38,420
that everybody kind of knows what that

1647
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:42,170
means

1648
01:07:38,420 --> 01:07:44,270
again based on a fairly funny video in

1649
01:07:42,170 --> 01:07:46,640
an advertising mode that's twenty years

1650
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:49,490
old now but we still use that phrase so

1651
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:50,810
I'm gonna say that like lots of amazing

1652
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:52,910
stuff has happened if you look at the

1653
01:07:50,810 --> 01:07:54,529
technology that's available outside it's

1654
01:07:52,910 --> 01:07:56,060
incredibly this industry has just

1655
01:07:54,530 --> 01:07:58,670
changed so much in the last four years

1656
01:07:56,060 --> 01:07:59,960
it's astonishing but I'm going to

1657
01:07:58,670 --> 01:08:02,120
challenge us and say that actually the

1658
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:04,790
the part where we communicate and that's

1659
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:06,470
squishy stuff that maybe we don't do

1660
01:08:04,790 --> 01:08:08,570
that as well as we could and that we

1661
01:08:06,470 --> 01:08:12,859
need to really look at moving the needle

1662
01:08:08,570 --> 01:08:15,110
of behavior change or user behavior

1663
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:23,000
using behavior change models much more

1664
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:24,710
than compliance thank you thank you very
