1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,960
so our second speaker for stream 4 is

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,720
garrett

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,080
o'hara who was the principal technical

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,440
consultant at minecast

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:11,759
so he was one of the first people to

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,678
start off minecast back in 2015.

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,679
so he's got over 20 years experience

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,840
across development ui ux

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,760
as well as technology communications so

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,439
he does a lot of work with organizations

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,760
to help them understand and manage their

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,080
cyber resistance strategies so

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,119
very topical i suppose so he'll be

14
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,479
taking us

15
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,000
or talking sharing information on how to

16
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,680
protect your organization and remote

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,239
working world with increasing threats

18
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,440
um just very topical again so garrett

19
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:38,640
welcome

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,079
take it off when you're ready and i hope

21
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:46,160
you'll enjoy

22
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,520
thank you john and appreciate the uh the

23
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:51,038
intro let me just get my

24
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,710
screen share going here and

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,840
we should be hopefully good too good to

26
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:58,320
[Music]

27
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,160
go

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,680
okay so uh thanks everybody for having

29
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,238
me along and good morning it's it's

30
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,119
really

31
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,400
great to be here at ozart set 2020. as

32
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,000
john said my name is

33
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,320
garr and obviously it says garrett on

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,640
the slide but everybody calls me gar and

35
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,559
so today i'm going to cover a what i

36
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,080
suspect is going to be a popular topic

37
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,000
in that it's achieving remote cyber

38
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,798
resilience and i'm going to start out by

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,400
looking at the

40
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,400
macro trends that have been happening

41
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,080
over various lengths of time

42
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,159
and but i've kind of coalesced and been

43
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,200
accelerated by kovid

44
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,720
then i want to look at some of the

45
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,520
priority shifts that we're seeing with

46
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,119
our customers

47
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,880
and i'm going to overlay some results

48
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,320
from an it news survey that we

49
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,079
commissioned on what i would call the

50
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,240
remote worker problem that

51
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,839
some of us are kind of going through and

52
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,880
it's really across two key areas so

53
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,320
awareness training

54
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,079
and then i'm gonna touch more lightly on

55
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,000
thread intel side of things but

56
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,039
probably more with an awareness training

57
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,640
flavor to that also

58
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,320
so am i bored well look hopefully

59
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,680
it's too early in the talk to be to be

60
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,600
bored right so

61
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,600
um and don't worry there's no poll here

62
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,199
um really what this relates to is the

63
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,759
huge huge change that we're actually

64
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,160
going through at the moment

65
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,840
and one of the biggest mirrors for the

66
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,680
zeitgeist

67
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,280
is google trends and look for those who

68
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,080
haven't played with google trends it's

69
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,520
really the

70
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,599
the window into what people are

71
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,480
searching for so it's slightly

72
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,238
voyeuristic

73
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,959
and but it's a peek into what's on

74
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,599
people's minds the search term i'm like

75
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:27,599
bored it actually saw a 325

76
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:29,280
increase across the globe between the 8

77
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,920
to the 14th of march

78
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,680
and the 22nd to the 28th of march so a

79
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,720
very noticeable inflection point that

80
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,920
i'm guessing people can

81
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,560
kind of figure out what's going on there

82
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,040
this is a pretty frivolous uh comparison

83
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,440
so this

84
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,480
compares the search terms pants and

85
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,519
shirts

86
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,640
and there's a point at the 8 to the 14th

87
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,000
of march where you can see it kind of

88
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,359
dips off completely

89
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,920
and then it comes back up and actually

90
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,840
they swap in terms of popularity and

91
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,119
it becomes more important to search for

92
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,040
the the term shirts

93
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,560
and rather than panzer you know again

94
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,079
i'm guessing people can

95
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:07,040
figure out what's going on there

96
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,640
the reality is that we're in a very very

97
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,599
different world we're into a new set of

98
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,599
challenges

99
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,839
and i took that photo on the left that

100
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,599
you can see there in wynyard station

101
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,000
in sydney it was in the middle of the

102
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,000
day it was just before 2 p.m

103
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,840
and anyone who knows that station knows

104
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,200
that normally there's people going in

105
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,280
and going out of the train there's

106
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,560
people waiting on the the platform

107
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,480
and as you can see there like none of

108
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,480
that is happening because the world just

109
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,238
changed so dramatically

110
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,560
first reports uh hitting kind of

111
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,040
december 2019 which

112
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,200
seems like such a lifetime ago now and

113
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,319
but really it was february 2020 when for

114
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,599
many of us the penny was kind of

115
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,399
starting to drop and then it was march

116
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,959
2020

117
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,480
when it felt like everything changed um

118
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,120
the minecast leadership team

119
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,119
the regional leadership team we met and

120
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:53,120
decided on the 13th of march we would do

121
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,720
a pilot day for work from home

122
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,720
and we actually haven't been back to the

123
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,680
office since then so it's been quite a

124
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,840
while

125
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,840
so you know we've seen school shifting

126
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,280
to online learning and that's probably

127
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,439
going to continue with digital learning

128
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,280
experiences post pandemic

129
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,040
uh healthcare is straining looking for

130
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,879
ways to do telehealth

131
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,879
we're seeing budgets frozen projects

132
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,239
frozen and sort of a lack of clarity of

133
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,840
how funding is going to be unlocked

134
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,959
potentially as those

135
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,160
programs move into the future a huge

136
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,918
drop in

137
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,520
in-person interactions which really you

138
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,880
know social distancing has changed the

139
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,799
rules of the game

140
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,000
and then locked in and particularly in

141
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,759
victoria i would say

142
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,560
actually created almost an entirely new

143
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,160
game so we live in in fairly strange

144
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,759
days i would say

145
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,479
and ultimately this is why shirts became

146
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,240
more popular on google trends than pants

147
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,680
because a little bit like the guy in the

148
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,520
photo here he's pretty happy with the

149
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,919
socks

150
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,880
we're seeing this just huge huge shift

151
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,080
and

152
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,759
what i'm going to do during the talk

153
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,719
today is i'm going to use responses and

154
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:52,320
stats from

155
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,759
respondents to a survey which was

156
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,479
conducted in june by

157
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,040
itunes on behalf of mimecast we got just

158
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:02,800
shy of 400 respondents

159
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:05,120
csos ctos ceos business owners

160
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:07,280
lots of other it professionals a big

161
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,680
chunk of them were from from large orgs

162
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,119
so

163
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,800
seats above 100 and the rest were fairly

164
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,880
evenly spread across kind of small

165
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,360
business and medium-sized businesses

166
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,600
it industry um education financial

167
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,919
services healthcare so a pretty broad

168
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,960
set of respondents so you know if you're

169
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,560
the guy in the photo you're feeling

170
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,919
obviously pretty happy

171
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,240
but the reality was that the hard

172
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,080
lockdown in some states was actually

173
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,759
forcing work from home at a scale that

174
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,599
no one had really dealt with or

175
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,880
seen before and was all done at very

176
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,080
short notice so

177
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,000
you're seeing this huge increase in

178
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,880
distraction anxiety challenging

179
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,639
work life balances but people for some

180
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,919
reason also kind of relaxed around

181
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,080
security

182
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,240
so this is it's just strange strange

183
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,719
days but we've sort of settled into it

184
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,720
in a way

185
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,840
so talking to then some of the

186
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,960
the sort of macro trends and and what's

187
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,198
actually been going

188
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,560
on and i kind of see that there's three

189
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,240
trends and three different timelines

190
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,759
here i would call out as well

191
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,759
but they are kind of coalescing into

192
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,160
this you know perfect storm and just the

193
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,240
odd

194
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,720
times that we're living to um

195
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,280
australia's first recession in 29 years

196
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,720
you know huge changes globally we're not

197
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,679
in the uh the marriott in surfers

198
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,880
paradise you know the

199
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,160
the beer worlds of beers last night was

200
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,000
just a different experience and i think

201
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,960
an excellent job for the times you're

202
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,080
living through but

203
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,758
certainly not the same as kind of

204
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,120
wandering around and sort of cracking a

205
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,720
can with uh different people on

206
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,479
different booths

207
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,600
so the three trends um like i said

208
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,120
they've got different time skills the

209
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,199
longest term is really this one of

210
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,319
global digital interdependence

211
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,440
and it's a long-term shift i would say

212
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,960
if you think about the people who make

213
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,080
filing cabinets they're not making the

214
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,840
same amount of money as they were

215
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,479
yesterday or last year

216
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,880
because everything is now digital and

217
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,880
we're

218
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,319
so interdependent and digitally linked

219
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,759
through edi

220
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,400
api endpoints email uh text messaging

221
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,639
apps and it's

222
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,479
everything is tied together digitally so

223
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,720
we're essentially all at risk from how

224
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,080
we all do cyber security

225
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,840
and what i'd say is covet has actually

226
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,080
pushed and accelerated that digital

227
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,758
dependency along and you see things like

228
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,520
team slack zoom whatsapp

229
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,240
everything is now digital so the you

230
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:17,599
know the kind of game has changed

231
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,840
um medium term is the

232
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,520
the sort of growth in geopolitical and

233
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,280
socioeconomic unrest

234
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,960
again this has been happening for some

235
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,799
time but covet is the

236
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,159
petrol and the bonfire and it's

237
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,440
accelerating the symptoms it's

238
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,199
accelerating the

239
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,639
the effects and exaggerating those

240
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,080
effects and it's creating a perfect set

241
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,520
of lures which i'm sure you know

242
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,800
everybody who's that ozark is kind of

243
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,799
aware of those

244
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,000
so for many time attackers it's the

245
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,400
perfect time you've got a

246
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,680
distracted anxious workforce and also if

247
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,359
you've got a bunch of it teams and

248
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,199
security teams who are

249
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,560
spinning up collaboration platforms

250
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,319
under a massive amount of pressure

251
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,120
without the normal time to

252
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,360
do analysis and security requirements so

253
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,800
it's a great camouflage for attackers

254
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,639
and what we're seeing as a company is

255
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,800
two things firstly it's an increase in

256
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,720
the volume of attacks and then secondly

257
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:05,360
the sophistication of those attacks is

258
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,319
also increasing

259
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,080
the shortest in time scales then and but

260
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,240
i would say this is the the huge

261
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,599
huge change as they shift to work from

262
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,199
home at scale

263
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:17,440
and that's putting a massive amount of

264
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,039
stress on you know call it good cyber

265
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,639
security practices

266
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,000
again this is a trend that was already

267
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,440
happening you know the increase in

268
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,160
flexible workplace

269
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,919
as a kind of a desired characteristic if

270
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,039
people were going for jobs it was often

271
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,560
one of the things that you would

272
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,880
get in when you're interviewing somebody

273
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,519
is that idea of flexible workplace

274
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,360
and the emergence of wework um hot

275
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,279
testing office companies so you know

276
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,560
wordpress being an example there

277
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:42,479
so again this is all things that was

278
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,640
happening but now we're seeing it at

279
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:46,399
a kind of a speed and velocity that is

280
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:48,080
just unprecedented

281
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:49,760
and then you can overlay the perennial

282
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,320
problems so you've got human errors

283
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,600
technical failures malicious attackers

284
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,040
and and really then companies are

285
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,200
dealing with the potential

286
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:59,839
for seismic disruption i think australia

287
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,440
has done very very well in talking to it

288
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,880
and security leaders i think we've got a

289
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,560
lot to be proud of here

290
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,800
and a lot of very exhausted people but

291
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:10,239
the outcome so far has been

292
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,920
i would say really really positive

293
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,160
what it would say though is that

294
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,839
regardless of the vaccine availability

295
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,839
and any kind of exit strategy

296
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,399
that you know new south wales victoria

297
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,880
queensland wa will have as states or at

298
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,440
a

299
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,480
national level there is an expectation

300
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,040
that we're going to see this

301
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,160
permanent shift in where people work and

302
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,000
what you're talking about there is

303
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,680
really more of a mobile workforce

304
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,519
and seeing that more on a permanent

305
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,959
basis or at least part of a flexible

306
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,399
work arrangement

307
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,560
and i think that's just going to be much

308
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,600
more common and i think what that plays

309
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,760
into then is

310
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,800
the longer term goals for security teams

311
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,839
are changing

312
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,160
and there's a bit of a shift in

313
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,720
priorities based on those um

314
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,800
shifting outcomes or shifting

315
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,480
expectations of australian citizens and

316
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,839
workers going forward

317
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,680
that word cloud that you can see there

318
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,080
with family time and spending

319
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,680
less and working from home that actually

320
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,519
comes from the australian bureau of

321
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,880
statistics and they do surveys on

322
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,600
australian citizens

323
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,439
one of the questions they asked is um

324
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,040
the aspects of life under cove 19

325
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,920
restrictions that australians would like

326
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,839
to see continue

327
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:15,040
post coven 19 and for the respondents 25

328
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,040
percent of them said

329
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,040
working or studying from home was one of

330
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,880
the things that they wanted to

331
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,319
continue so

332
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,240
what you're then sort of talking about

333
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,920
let me just move forward on a slide here

334
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,519
um is kind of thinking about what are

335
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,839
those priorities and what's the shift

336
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:36,640
that's kind of happening

337
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:38,560
organ so pre-covid

338
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,640
you know the the general thing was

339
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,199
investment in cyber security of some

340
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,959
sort

341
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,560
and that's a pretty standard thing i

342
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,239
would say for most organizations there's

343
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,000
a security strategy

344
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,839
and you know there's goals around that

345
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,160
focus on investing in security all that

346
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,480
kind of bau stuff that we're all used to

347
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,600
and a fairly big focus on moving to the

348
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,079
clouds

349
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,240
so i didn't talk to any organizations

350
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,800
that weren't either already on the cloud

351
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,760
or had projects in play to figure out

352
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,079
how to work

353
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,399
or move workflows or workloads to the

354
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,560
cloud or in some form or another

355
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,600
and then education of users that wasn't

356
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,119
always number three for

357
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,800
some organizations that was actually

358
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,560
lower down the list but it was generally

359
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,479
somewhere around that

360
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,119
set of kind of priorities and for

361
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:23,680
security teams free covert

362
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:26,000
and then uh look at covert hit we're all

363
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,000
kind of aware of what that looks like

364
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,040
and what you saw was this huge huge

365
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
shift in priorities

366
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,399
for really everybody um middle of march

367
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,240
to

368
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:36,160
through to april really forget

369
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,079
everything you know the the absolute

370
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,680
sort of um priority was how do we adapt

371
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,439
how do we survive

372
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,120
and that really was the focus around

373
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:45,040
enabling remote workers so

374
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,200
things like how do we get our vpn

375
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,519
together for a much higher workload how

376
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,240
do we ship hardware in some cases to

377
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,360
people who are now working from home um

378
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,440
just all of that

379
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,880
sort of pseudo admin but things that

380
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,880
were just required to keep

381
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,320
organizations operational as the

382
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,399
workforce just

383
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,920
went on mass and stampeded out to work

384
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,440
from home rather than

385
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,279
working from potentially a physical

386
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:11,440
location behind a

387
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:13,120
you know pseudo-physical perimeter

388
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,720
and what we've we've sort of settled

389
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,600
into then is this kind of call it new

390
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,120
life

391
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,920
i was chatting to a few people a little

392
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,560
bit earlier on around this idea that

393
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,360
it's starting to feel normal which is in

394
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,079
and of itself

395
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,639
a little bit of a like it's starting to

396
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,319
feel

397
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,320
a little bit funny you know that this is

398
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,000
becoming kind of life now

399
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,000
and what we're seeing then is a

400
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,480
reflection of this new state

401
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
and new kind of priorities where we're

402
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,000
not adapting and surviving

403
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,200
it's really kind of okay here we are how

404
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
do we kind of now start

405
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,760
improving things with that um when it

406
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,440
comes to kind of remote cyber resilience

407
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,160
one of the big things we've seen

408
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,560
in australian companies is they shift to

409
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,880
a

410
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,839
much higher priority for the education

411
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,079
of users

412
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,200
and i'm guessing people who are at us

413
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,880
are 2020

414
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,160
you know look we're all across what

415
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,720
happened there in terms of phishing

416
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,079
attacks

417
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,079
um just a huge uptick in covert related

418
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,760
and other phishing attacks and spam and

419
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,599
sms that was coming through

420
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,120
so education of users became much more

421
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,720
important because of where people

422
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,399
were working and the mental state that

423
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,839
lots of people were in

424
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,079
and you saw the normalization of this

425
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,360
new reality um as

426
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,199
you know i've spoken about already

427
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,320
reflected in the abs stats securing

428
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,120
against more threats

429
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,000
that tended to take some version of you

430
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,519
know do more

431
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,200
with less but you know understanding

432
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,800
that the threats um that were happening

433
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,920
were just more significant and there was

434
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,599
more of them

435
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,519
and investing in cyber security remained

436
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,360
moving to the cloud actually for some

437
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,839
organizations we saw there was a

438
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:41,600
an acceleration or a higher priority for

439
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,000
some cloud workloads

440
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,839
because the the penny dropped that an

441
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,440
on-prem solution when you started to

442
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,240
work from home and it was either load on

443
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,480
a vpn

444
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,240
or it just couldn't really service the

445
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,360
workforce in the same way

446
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,480
um using a remote connectivity

447
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,839
and then you know efficiency and

448
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:01,600
automation again iran's pre-covered and

449
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,360
we just took on a kind of new

450
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,720
level of importance potentially as we go

451
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,639
forward and

452
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,720
the importance of like the lowered mean

453
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:12,240
time to respond being time to retect

454
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,920
um kind of kicked in so what i'd like to

455
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,440
do now is just kind of pivot over and

456
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,880
i'm gonna do something that i'll be

457
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,160
honest i don't normally do in talks

458
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,120
which is kind of like have a bit of a

459
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,519
data focus

460
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,639
and um maybe it's just a reflection of

461
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,720
the the

462
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,720
the time that we're living through and i

463
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,399
feel some element of comfort in just

464
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,839
looking at raw data and stats and kind

465
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,720
of using that as a proxy for what's

466
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,320
happening and kind of trying to

467
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,680
understand the world

468
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:37,440
um what you're seeing here is data from

469
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,279
a report that if you google this you can

470
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,560
find it and it came out from our global

471
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,120
threat intel team

472
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,000
and it's really just a general thread

473
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,360
intel

474
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:50,160
uh report um around the uh

475
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,120
first 100 days of covet i see questions

476
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,439
that just come through

477
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,399
um it's actually in the report and i

478
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,279
don't know the exact

479
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,560
date that this starts at um but if a few

480
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,760
ones just come to the booth and i can

481
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,160
get you the report and we can kind of go

482
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,079
through

483
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,839
where exactly it started from i think it

484
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,880
starts from mid february

485
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,160
um but i'll qualify that when um you

486
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,120
know if we chat

487
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,079
so looking at um the stats here what

488
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,560
you're really seeing

489
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,120
is malware detections you know huge

490
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,800
uptick

491
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,639
business email compromise slash

492
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,959
impersonation detections uptake

493
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,639
massive uptick in blocked urls and that

494
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:25,439
for me is a proxy for

495
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,959
that increase in the volume of attacks

496
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,800
here there's no kind of inference of

497
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,680
sophistication this is a pure volume

498
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,240
kind of

499
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,519
uh pure volume stat and that's the thing

500
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,600
we're seeing this increase

501
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,880
in the amount of attacks and then we're

502
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,800
also seeing the increase

503
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,639
increase in the amount of attacks in

504
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,000
terms of sorry the sophistication of

505
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,680
those attacks

506
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,040
generally playing through with better

507
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,758
social engineering

508
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,759
that preys on anxiety distractions and

509
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,800
also the the fact that code is going on

510
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,560
at the moment so

511
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,800
as you can see from the quote from it

512
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:56,479
news um you know it's it's

513
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,959
pretty challenging time for security and

514
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,759
i t leaders

515
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:03,359
so the kind of question i had then um as

516
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,199
i started digging through this stuff was

517
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,440
is there actually a direct line between

518
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,560
work from home and increased risk or

519
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,240
you know is it one of those things we

520
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,680
talk about but it doesn't really show up

521
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,680
anywhere

522
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,959
and this is data from the it news survey

523
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,279
where you can see that about five

524
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:21,119
percent of organizations are reporting

525
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:22,880
breaches involved in uh work from home

526
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,240
and you know that equates to about one

527
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,360
and twenty you know five percent doesn't

528
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,880
seem like a whole lot but actually one

529
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,519
in 20 when i kind of think about it in

530
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,120
those terms

531
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,560
it's it's a reasonable amount but it's

532
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,519
not the important number is what i would

533
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,959
say

534
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,800
the really important number is actually

535
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,719
the 31

536
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,560
because that number is is the number of

537
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,959
people who don't know if reach involving

538
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,040
work

539
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:42,880
from home has actually occurred and and

540
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,959
for any of us in security

541
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,639
uh uncertainty or a lack of clarity is

542
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,719
often the biggest worry you know it's

543
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,000
the the lack of clarity that is probably

544
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,680
again causing a lot of stress

545
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,680
for it and security teams

546
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,320
and that then lines up with the stats

547
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:01,360
around using technology so this is

548
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,720
again the it news survey and when we

549
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,440
asked the respondents how does your

550
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,520
organization

551
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,199
know if employees are actually following

552
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,400
cybersecurity best practice when working

553
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,079
remotely

554
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,679
a quarter of respondents actually had no

555
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,480
idea whether employees are actually

556
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,360
doing that

557
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,120
best practice security at home and that

558
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,399
could suggest a few different things

559
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,799
it could suggest that companies have

560
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,720
been very distracted purely by the

561
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:24,799
covert 19 response and everything else

562
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,079
that is going on to actually deploy

563
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,839
you know what they would see as good

564
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,080
monitoring processes

565
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,440
and you know ultimately what that means

566
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,840
in a way is that there's an entrusting

567
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,840
of the security of networks to

568
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,600
really users potentially the families

569
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,520
that are sharing those homes and those

570
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,520
uh consumer grades connections to the

571
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,440
internet in australia

572
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,200
and people doing flat shares you know

573
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,760
there's a very kind of heterogeneous

574
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:49,600
um types of homes that are out there

575
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,280
where the workforces actually are so

576
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,000
that's kind of a consideration

577
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:55,039
but ultimately maybe it points to little

578
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,039
or maybe no control

579
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,679
and over you know the security of

580
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,039
potentially sensitive company data

581
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,120
what i would say is that there's really

582
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,720
good news here in that when you look at

583
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,439
it three quarters of the respondents

584
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,799
have organizations that are using some

585
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,039
sort of tech to measure

586
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,559
cyber security compliance and also to do

587
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,799
some kind of testing for employees which

588
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,160
is a good thing um

589
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,918
as you'd expect email security

590
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,520
monitoring is is the most kind of

591
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,120
widely deployed followed then by web

592
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,840
security i'm going to say that web

593
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,439
security

594
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,678
in the current environment is actually

595
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,559
very good it's a very fast and effective

596
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,039
way

597
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,320
and depending on your approach to it to

598
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,039
really kind of either remediate or

599
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,439
eliminate

600
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,440
end users abilities to go to a

601
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,640
categories of websites or known bad

602
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,120
websites so

603
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,320
again an easy win and for organizations

604
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,399
as they're trying

605
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,760
uh desperate to get that resilience for

606
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,280
that remote work

607
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:48,320
excuse me remote workforce and here's a

608
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,559
couple of examples

609
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,918
and of what those attacks look like and

610
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,520
again for this kind of audience you know

611
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,960
i'm guessing everybody's kind of seen

612
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,720
this stuff you know you'll see an email

613
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,400
come through it's got a link

614
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,320
the link is going to bring you to a

615
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,520
credit harvesting site

616
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:05,678
quite often awa um or you know something

617
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,679
like that where they're just looking for

618
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,360
either creds or also things like credit

619
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,000
card information you know more probably

620
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,399
consumer

621
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,039
um or you know citizen focused attacks

622
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,400
on those

623
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:18,080
kind of things um and then also

624
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,480
like interestingly there's a pretty big

625
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,399
uptick in the brand jacking stuff so

626
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,039
things like streaming services delivery

627
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,840
services where as everybody knows people

628
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,679
are at home

629
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:29,199
they're not stuck i mean let's be honest

630
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:31,200
it's quite enjoyable watching and

631
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,320
 watching stuff on netflix or with

632
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,160
disney

633
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,678
but we're relying on those services

634
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,720
because we're in locked in and we're

635
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:38,480
relying on

636
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,559
delivery services because we're locked

637
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,240
in and you know it's fairly obvious that

638
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,080
attackers will go and use that stuff and

639
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,039
brand jack that

640
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:50,159
those those large trusted brands and for

641
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:52,640
essentially social engineering

642
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,679
so with emails being really the most

643
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,200
popular way in

644
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,799
um you know the big question then is how

645
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,799
do you actually protect against

646
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,559
malicious emails coming into play

647
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:02,559
and you know here again is the data from

648
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,000
the it news survey and like no real

649
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,520
surprises here i would say for most

650
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,640
security practitioners we're doing

651
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,960
things to

652
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,799
um you know block and scan urls we're

653
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,840
doing things to detect business email

654
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:14,400
compromise

655
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:16,080
we're scanning for malware i would say

656
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,240
the real surprise here

657
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,399
is that there's a number greater than

658
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:22,159
zero of respondents who apparently don't

659
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,600
have any security tools or features to

660
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,280
stop malicious emails

661
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,719
to remote workers and i suspect that

662
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,480
might be just a

663
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,240
an artifact of the data i really i just

664
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,000
hope that's hope that's not true

665
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,640
and you know it's definitely kind of an

666
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,840
interesting response

667
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:39,919
so continuing then to look at data

668
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,959
and i found this one really really

669
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,640
interesting

670
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,200
what you're looking at here is a chart

671
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,960
that shows a very strong correlation

672
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,200
between users who have had awareness

673
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:51,760
training and a lower incidence of

674
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,200
malicious link clicks so what you're

675
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,280
looking at is a chart that really

676
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,280
cross-references user behavior

677
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,360
and here we're very much using malicious

678
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,360
links as the proxy for that behavior so

679
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,000
it is one sort of attribute of overall

680
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,479
user behavior

681
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,320
but it's a pretty strong one and to the

682
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:09,919
use of awareness training

683
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,720
and in reality it's actually a 5.2 times

684
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,720
and reduction in malicious link clicks

685
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,440
for folks who've been through

686
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,520
awareness training pretty covet i like

687
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,600
this it points to what i suspect many of

688
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,280
us or most of us or all of us probably

689
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,240
know already which is

690
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,080
uh you know human firewall people is

691
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,520
absolutely critical and for remote

692
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,039
sovereign resilience for remote

693
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,039
workforces

694
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:34,158
it's it's beyond kind of optional i

695
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,440
would say it's actually pretty much

696
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,840
essential to

697
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,480
um to bolster that star wars and cyber

698
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,918
resilience

699
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:43,360
and posture for remote workforces

700
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,360
um these days like you're actually

701
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,918
looking at pretty sophisticated coveted

702
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,840
related attacks and retail scams

703
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:50,799
and one of the issues is that you're you

704
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,879
know we're all kind of working through

705
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:54,000
this blurred lines of home and work life

706
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,400
and you know i'm sitting in my office

707
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,320
which

708
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,000
is actually just a second room uh where

709
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,480
myself and my wife live

710
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,320
and that's confusing sometimes you know

711
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,760
i'm doing personal stuff on work laptops

712
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,559
i'm doing work on personal

713
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:08,080
um devices and we actually had a recent

714
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,960
example a company that works in

715
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,840
recruitment where

716
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,080
one of their users logged into personal

717
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,678
email

718
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,360
and it was on the same device that they

719
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,039
use for their work and you know

720
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,879
obviously unintentionally

721
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:20,720
and but did send a malicious email to

722
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,480
some of her colleagues and

723
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,640
and very quickly actually within minutes

724
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,480
it had kind of hit the ceo's mailbox and

725
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,400
it was detected so you know no harm no

726
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,559
foul didn't cause any damage

727
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,559
um but you know that that sort of work

728
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,918
life and the blurred edge and blurred

729
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,879
lines kind of makes things a little bit

730
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,039
interesting

731
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,799
and interestingly that um that

732
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,200
organization had just heard a security

733
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:43,200
person

734
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,799
and six weeks ago seven weeks gone down

735
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,320
so what i want to do now is kind of dig

736
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:50,639
into what makes

737
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:52,158
good security and awareness training um

738
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,360
programs and i'm just going to do a

739
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,200
timeout here there's a couple of people

740
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,959
asking about the slides and we can

741
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,640
sort that out um don't worry about that

742
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,159
we can get this invite to to the folks

743
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,520
who are asking so that's militia

744
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:05,919
sorry melissa and uh virginia um

745
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,360
so yeah looking looking at what um makes

746
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,640
good security and awareness training

747
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,639
programs

748
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,080
and i get a little bit of a bit of sort

749
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,280
of stick for using this code but i

750
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,520
really like it

751
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,720
i think it's sort of amusing it's quite

752
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,840
old and people i'm sure have heard it

753
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,200
before you know it's the idea that

754
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,918
knowledge is knowing that a tomato is

755
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,679
fruit

756
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,520
and wisdom is not putting in a fruit

757
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,400
salad and that's those things are both

758
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,320
true

759
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,919
and the analogy here though i would say

760
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,559
is that overlays to secure it in

761
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,840
awareness training programs is that

762
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,240
knowledge isn't enough but actually

763
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,080
neither is wisdom what we're looking for

764
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:37,919
here is good security outcomes and

765
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,399
you know what that ultimately means is a

766
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:42,960
lower risk profile for the organization

767
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,400
what that means is a change in behavior

768
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,000
and that's a very very meaningful

769
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:47,520
difference

770
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,440
this stuff it actually needs to be part

771
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,799
of the culture right so bob who's in

772
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,880
accounting

773
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,080
on a tuesday morning you need to be

774
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,679
engaged enough to not

775
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,439
click on the link because he's a little

776
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,279
bit lazy and

777
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,559
even though he thinks that you know this

778
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,360
thing looks a little bit weird

779
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:05,600
still clicks on the link or alice from

780
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,760
hr you know needs to be engaged enough

781
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,719
to report this weird behavior she's

782
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,559
seeing

783
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,559
just after she clicked enable macros and

784
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,760
a resume that just arrived for job

785
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,120
hosting that she didn't actually even

786
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,320
know that they had

787
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,000
so what i'm going to say is in this

788
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,559
maybe strained analogies that you know

789
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,840
we need

790
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:21,678
to we need the knowledge we need the

791
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,279
wisdom but mostly we actually need to

792
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,799
make the fruit salad so

793
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,799
you know forget about the tomatoes and

794
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:29,840
let's just make some salad um

795
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:32,960
yeah so what does the it

796
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:34,559
news survey tell us on this stuff um

797
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,919
look the you know when asked the

798
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:37,520
question how does your organization

799
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,640
educate employees about cyber security

800
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,120
best practices from

801
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,320
remote work i'm going to say that some

802
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:43,918
of these things yes they

803
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,520
like they need to be done from a policy

804
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:46,960
perspective but i'm going to call it out

805
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,080
that maybe they don't change that much

806
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,440
in terms of outcomes

807
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,360
and an example of that would be

808
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,799
providing lists of guidelines

809
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,600
you actually have to do that quite often

810
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:57,918
so new starters or with a change in

811
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,279
security environments you know the

812
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,559
reality is that could be done for

813
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,279
compliance requirements if you're

814
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,678
aligning to

815
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,799
iso standards for example and or it

816
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,919
could be

817
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:10,879
um it could be the uh

818
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:12,400
it could be also the um the security

819
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,600
cyber security insurance is you know

820
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,520
it's valid

821
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,799
that um if you don't have those policies

822
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,960
and guidelines put out there that you

823
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:20,400
know your policy is going to be void so

824
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,400
what i'm going to say though is as an

825
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,000
industry we're seeing shifts

826
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:26,000
going towards behavior change and you

827
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,080
see that in lots of different places

828
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,919
and i saw a talk where somebody from the

829
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,360
new south wales state government was

830
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:33,520
talking about that stuff

831
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,039
and they were engaging a behavior change

832
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,158
team and that is such a good sign i

833
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,760
think in terms of

834
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,799
understanding what we've gotten wrong

835
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:42,559
and how we can do this stuff better

836
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,918
so i'm going to pile in on the data here

837
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,279
and like i say i don't normally do this

838
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:47,279
stuff but um there's just so

839
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,960
such kind of rich pickings at the moment

840
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,120
in terms of what's out there

841
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,039
and this time it's actually from a study

842
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,039
forester consulting did and it was into

843
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,640
security and awareness training

844
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,320
i love it and because i don't really

845
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,799
have to hypothesize anymore

846
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,399
on this stuff i i think i'm like many

847
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:03,760
people in our industry where we talked

848
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,360
about awareness training and how it

849
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,600
wasn't working and we we kind of had a

850
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,039
suspicion of what was wrong

851
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:11,840
and the numbers here actually tell a

852
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,520
really good story excuse me

853
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,039
um if you look at this like nearly a

854
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,400
third of employees are going around

855
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,640
security policies

856
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,080
and to uh to our friends over in new

857
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,919
zealand that number actually jumped to

858
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,760
a half of employees so i don't know what

859
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:25,360
that really means but uh

860
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,960
you know overall a third of employees

861
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,639
going around security policies

862
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:30,720
and what that means is we don't have

863
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,320
engagement at the level we need

864
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,159
and people are going around security

865
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,200
policies and that puts our organizations

866
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,960
at risk

867
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,440
so we don't have employees that actually

868
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,440
understand and are also engaged in the

869
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,960
importance of cyber security

870
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,279
and i'm going to ask the question why

871
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:47,440
and i'm guessing people kind of um

872
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:49,279
people kind of know it's that you know

873
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,640
the traditional delivery of security and

874
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,919
awareness training programs and i've

875
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,600
been banging this drone for a little

876
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,440
while now so forgive me for repeating

877
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,279
myself but they're long-winded

878
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,720
they tend to be boring contents that

879
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,720
people just feel like they have to get

880
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,240
through it gets done on a cbt

881
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,240
a computer-based training system or a

882
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,760
learning management system

883
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,919
you watch the video compliance teams are

884
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,000
stoked because they get a 90 95

885
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,440
completion rate but actually your

886
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,600
behavior is not changing

887
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,840
in in a meaningful way or at least not

888
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,879
enough and the bit that's missing is the

889
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,879
culture

890
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,000
and i'm not the only one saying this

891
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,679
there's academics

892
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,080
ktrm out of um the business school then

893
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:27,279
you know adelaide shrek joshi who some

894
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,559
people may know wrote that you know a

895
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,000
book in awareness training like

896
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:33,279
we're all talking about the same stuff

897
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,559
here but it's a culture play

898
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,000
employees they need to look left they

899
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,639
need to look right they need to look up

900
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,559
down

901
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,039
and they need to see these social norms

902
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,879
that say the the stuff is important and

903
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,919
if it's not then we're actually

904
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,600
um in um

905
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,440
uh importance then you know it's we're

906
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,879
in big trouble here

907
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,799
we're also in big trouble if people are

908
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,880
you know going to use byod which many

909
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,879
people are in shadow i.t because

910
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,120
of current situations meaning they're

911
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,640
forced to try and be efficient

912
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,719
while they're waiting for the security

913
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,360
and i t teams to do what's necessary

914
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,440
and by that i mean requirements analysis

915
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,879
and the security analysis that normally

916
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,399
happens but has to be

917
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,760
either shortened or let's be honest

918
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,039
sometimes skipped because we need to

919
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,200
kind of spin up platforms

920
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,559
very quickly at the moment so you get

921
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,880
tom and tom needs to share

922
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,158
file with a partner org so what he's

923
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,840
going to do is spin up a

924
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:24,080
dropbox account or something worse in a

925
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,000
way he goes and the problem here

926
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,120
is that tom you know wearing his happy

927
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,480
socks is

928
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,719
at best you know he's got knowledge of

929
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,880
what cyber security is

930
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,960
and but you know if he's not engaged and

931
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,120
he's gonna do the dropbox thing or

932
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,240
worse and you know we've all gonna you

933
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,158
know we've all got problems then

934
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,080
the second big problem i'm gonna say is

935
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,200
how we're measuring the success of

936
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,879
awareness training

937
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,880
or you know call them behavior change

938
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,880
programs because so often we're actually

939
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,799
not we're not doing that at all

940
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,200
fish taste fish testing massively

941
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,720
popular and incredibly useful as a point

942
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,799
in time measure

943
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,799
of one very specific security behavior

944
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,240
which is don't click on the link

945
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:04,240
it's one behavior security is much

946
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,520
bigger than that

947
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,520
i'm going to say that you know what's

948
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,440
what that is it's a test it doesn't

949
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,520
we know tests don't change behavior long

950
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,039
term not even medium and probably not

951
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,279
even short term

952
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:16,960
behavior change takes longer longer

953
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,480
amount of time it takes a combination of

954
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,039
knowledge transfer

955
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:23,200
application of that knowledge um it can

956
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,480
be passive it has to be active

957
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,559
what you're looking for is an outcome

958
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:28,880
where there's knowledge sentiment

959
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,000
and there's an engagement component to

960
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,840
this so you can't

961
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,080
like obviously manage what you haven't

962
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,678
measured that is a missing piece but you

963
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,399
need to be meaningful measurements of

964
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:40,799
that human aspect of cyber security

965
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:42,080
because um what we've done is used

966
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,080
information and that doesn't

967
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,840
change people's minds like that's the

968
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,279
reality um

969
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,559
you can have important information and

970
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,240
if you get an audience that's not

971
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,760
interested

972
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,279
who cares like they're going to go to

973
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,720
the beach that's closed this is uh

974
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,480
saying killed i think this is actually a

975
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,279
pretty famous photo now but um i didn't

976
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,360
realize when i

977
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:01,120
chose it there's people playing football

978
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,840
there's people sunbathing walking around

979
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,360
on the beach that's closed you know

980
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,240
information it's understood by people

981
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:08,000
but the audience

982
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,039
they're just not interested because they

983
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,039
have a life they want to live

984
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,959
and i've talked about this stuff before

985
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,440
you know like the reality is we need to

986
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,840
do

987
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:19,520
more and we need to do better and you

988
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,360
know authors like sharok joshi

989
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,679
academics like kate in the union of

990
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,559
adelaide lots of people are singing this

991
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,880
song

992
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,760
um janan burj from forrester like

993
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,640
there's lots of us

994
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,158
saying hey we need to do better here and

995
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,720
one of the things we potentially can

996
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,320
point to

997
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,679
is the advertising and marketing

998
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,360
industry and say well actually they're

999
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,080
pretty good at getting us to change our

1000
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:40,158
behavior

1001
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,678
what do they do first thing is the

1002
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,440
cadence

1003
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,120
you know maybe nobody likes ads but the

1004
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,039
reality is we get lots of them

1005
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:49,360
because of repetition unfortunately the

1006
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,640
thing that often changes our behavior

1007
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,039
and they're also memorable and they're

1008
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:56,080
memorable because they use in from

1009
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:57,600
emotion so you know if you can see the

1010
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,840
examples here it could be fear

1011
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:01,600
it could be love of a puppy for a horse

1012
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,840
it could be respect

1013
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,959
often it's humor it's you know a funny

1014
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,959
toilet roll it's

1015
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,080
i love the one in the bottom um the

1016
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,760
middle bottom

1017
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:13,120
uh particularly like that um

1018
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,279
the uh you know we're looking for

1019
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,479
graphic designer um it's just brilliant

1020
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,880
it really appeals to me and then you

1021
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,600
know the funny phuket ad

1022
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,200
the point here is we need punch through

1023
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,559
we're not getting it so we need to

1024
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:27,200
change how we do it and we need to

1025
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,799
change how we message to uh end users

1026
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,120
and to employees if you get a marketing

1027
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,039
team

1028
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,959
go use them if you've got a poor team go

1029
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,399
use them get their input into the

1030
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,679
messaging that you're using as a

1031
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:38,719
security practitioner

1032
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,720
to those end users

1033
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,559
so thread intel um look at tread intel

1034
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,919
is incredibly useful day to day as

1035
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,158
everybody knows you know operational

1036
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:49,679
threat intel strategic threat intel

1037
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:52,640
and you've got companies like recorded

1038
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:54,720
future calvin pang is a good guys here

1039
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,919
and i'm sure would be happy to talk to

1040
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:57,600
folks who are into this stuff but you

1041
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,799
know it's really really useful

1042
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,320
for improving uh day-to-day security

1043
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,760
uh the posture and the plans for

1044
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,678
programs and investments if it's

1045
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,760
strategic throughout intel

1046
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,000
um i was speaking to a guy called dr

1047
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:13,519
francis gaffney and he's a guy who

1048
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,559
um who runs our global at thread intel

1049
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,720
team

1050
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:18,480
and we were chatting with fred intel he

1051
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,279
actually raised the importance of it as

1052
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,559
a

1053
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:24,799
way to augment and do a better job of

1054
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:26,840
security and awareness training

1055
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:28,240
his comment was that if you use real

1056
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,959
campaigns

1057
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,559
that you're in a position to cut through

1058
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,760
in a way that maybe is more meaningful

1059
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:37,440
than using generic

1060
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:39,600
campaigns and uh yes adam that is

1061
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:42,799
whopper from war games so well

1062
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:46,080
well spotted um so yes like

1063
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:47,918
the reality is swapping out um

1064
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,439
the the generic examples for stuff

1065
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,559
that's actually come from from maybe

1066
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,000
your operational or

1067
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,480
technical thread intel if you've got

1068
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,240
those feeds that's really good for using

1069
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,519
as a way to augment your um

1070
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,519
your awareness training program

1071
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,200
right so you know here's an example and

1072
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:07,120
this is one our security teams picked up

1073
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,799
it was actually a fake linkedin profile

1074
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,959
and it was pushed out to a number of

1075
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:12,799
mimecast employees i got it

1076
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:14,480
um if the picture is big enough on your

1077
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,240
screen and hopefully it is

1078
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,919
you might pick up on what i thought was

1079
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,960
kind of a weird photo apparently it's a

1080
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,799
stock image of a

1081
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:22,080
a model and i don't know how to

1082
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,600
pronounce the name you know if it's

1083
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,600
mallet or malay

1084
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,199
but you know the person was apparently

1085
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,840
not feeling up to a nice photo on the

1086
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,159
big day

1087
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:31,918
um so it just it felt a little bit fishy

1088
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:34,640
for me and i didn't connect

1089
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,960
um but the point here is that our

1090
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,799
security team there were using timely

1091
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,039
relevant information to cut through to

1092
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:43,039
the the global employee base

1093
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,799
and as you can see from the screenshot

1094
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,720
here it was slack it wasn't email

1095
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,799
so they covered a couple a couple of

1096
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,320
different comms channels

1097
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,480
the point here really is that it's not

1098
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:53,439
always bad emails and it can be

1099
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,120
different things you know that's the

1100
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,399
reality you know there's lots of stats

1101
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,799
um

1102
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,799
verizon do it you know awesome report

1103
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:04,080
every year the um data breach

1104
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:05,519
um the data deeper um i've got the

1105
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,559
acronym because i'm giving a talk so

1106
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,840
that happens but

1107
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,320
everybody knows it you know that comes

1108
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,560
out every year it's a phenomenally good

1109
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:14,720
piece of collateral at nine out of ten

1110
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,520
attacks cofens have one

1111
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,719
um we do one everyone says the same

1112
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,359
thing like you're going to see

1113
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,918
more than 9 out of a 10 attacks that

1114
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,359
actually do

1115
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:27,279
to start with um with email so what's an

1116
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:29,040
example of that

1117
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,639
um this comes from our messaging

1118
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,719
security operations center or

1119
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,480
our msoc as we call them and it's an os

1120
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:36,480
post and brand jacking

1121
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,000
again there's obviously no reflection on

1122
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,760
those posts you know it's it's almost a

1123
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,399
sign of respect that your brand is

1124
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,159
um is useful well known and respected

1125
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,199
enough when you're you're sort of pop up

1126
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:47,679
in these things so there's a

1127
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:49,279
zero reflection on those posts and you

1128
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:51,359
know it's got nothing to do with them

1129
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,960
they just happen to be used as a lure

1130
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,639
yeah in this case because it makes sense

1131
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,079
because covet and because lots of people

1132
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,040
in places like melbourne

1133
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:01,119
are getting deliveries on a daily basis

1134
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,920
so with this one you see the the

1135
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:05,440
the link comes through and it refers to

1136
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,000
missing delivery package that's come

1137
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,440
through and

1138
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,800
again people in melbourne most of them

1139
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,400
are waiting for like two or three

1140
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,760
packages at any given time

1141
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,560
now you click on the link it goes

1142
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:16,400
through to a compromise domain obviously

1143
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,759
nothing to do with uh oz post but it's

1144
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,040
got a fish kit but it does have their

1145
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,560
logo on there

1146
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,920
and you know when you enter your credit

1147
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,480
card information then it does this kind

1148
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,200
of you know

1149
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,040
processing requests and then goes to a

1150
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,480
an sms verification verification which

1151
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,920
is weird because you actually notice you

1152
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,960
haven't actually put in any mobile

1153
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,520
numbers

1154
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,640
um but this stuff is happening all the

1155
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,160
time you know i'm guessing people are

1156
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,160
well well aware

1157
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,359
of um you know what that stuff looks

1158
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,040
like and

1159
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:42,560
uh and gauze he's just commenting the

1160
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:44,640
thread absolutely looks familiar and

1161
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:45,839
thank you for the example and gauze runs

1162

find it um

1171
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,480
but this is again thread intel around

1172
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,040
the number of domains being

1173
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,240
um you know registered and blocked the

1174
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,359
point here is that you're seeing a

1175
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,000
pretty big

1176
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:13,759
upward trend upward movement in both the

1177
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,720
registration and then the blocking

1178
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,160
of those domains and blocked pages

1179
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,598
apologies for the resolution of the

1180
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,118
charts by the way i did the

1181
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,800
um the old-school thing and just kind of

1182
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,000
used a snip to pull them into a

1183
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,839
powerpoint so

1184
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,599
and the ones in the actual reporter are

1185
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:30,240
higher um definition

1186
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,400
the point here is you know those trends

1187
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,240
if it was a stock you'd be pretty stoked

1188
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,880
and for things like you know malicious

1189
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:39,439
domains and covert related domains

1190
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:41,119
and it's kind of less um yeah less of a

1191
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,640
happy time

1192
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:44,880
so given the spikes though you know what

1193
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:46,160
what are the spikes in the domains and

1194
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,359
the blocking then it

1195
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,879
kind of for me becomes important to

1196
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,799
think about the tools the features that

1197
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,240
potentially people are using to stop the

1198
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,640
unsafe web pages

1199
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,919
again back to the itunes survey here and

1200
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,319
it kind of shines a lot on what's out

1201
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,800
there

1202
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,240
lots of different approaches uh great to

1203
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:02,640
see you know firewall stuff out there

1204
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,560
proxy based web filters dns is

1205
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,680
dns i think is particularly elegant at

1206
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,359
the moment because

1207
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,799
it's very easy to roll out and it

1208
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,000
actually is a pretty effective it

1209
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,280
doesn't get you all the way there but it

1210
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,160
gets you most of the way there for

1211
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,480
blocking

1212
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:16,640
and website categories and potentially

1213
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:18,000
uh malicious sites in a fairly light way

1214
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,879
without sort of the you know the full

1215
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,079
monty of a

1216
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,720
firewall rollout so and good to see that

1217
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:25,839
the different approaches there so then

1218
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,520
look just a quick summary

1219
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:29,920
like the value of ti like everybody gets

1220
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,839
it um you know uh thread intel with the

1221
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:33,040
pandemic we've got more attacks right so

1222
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,320
thread intel is going to tell you about

1223
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,000
the campaigns

1224
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,839
and you know if they hit what's the

1225
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,599
impact going to be it helps with

1226
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,440
incident response what's the remediation

1227
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:44,640
potential because you understand

1228
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,920
from the technical uh or operational

1229
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,440
threat intel like what what's the

1230
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,640
remediation that's needed maybe what

1231
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,480
tech controls are needed to be

1232
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,240
put in place but ultimately you're

1233
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,839
driving to a better mean time to detect

1234
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:57,279
and mean time to respond

1235
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:57,920
um and the horizon sophistication of

1236
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,359
attacks

1237
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:01,760
is an interesting one your big game

1238
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:02,960
hunters cosmic links was one that hit a

1239
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,440
probably a month or two ago at this

1240
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:07,119
point but those step changes in

1241
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,119
sophistication of attacks are

1242
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:11,119
very very useful to know in terms of

1243
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:12,800
trending and because they're what you're

1244
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,400
looking at is strategically what are the

1245
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,960
security controls in the future that you

1246
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,599
want to

1247
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,960
set at the right level and to cater for

1248
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:19,920
something that maybe in the future could

1249
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,680
put your business

1250
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,920
your organization at risk you know but

1251
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,040
ultimately making everybody aware of new

1252
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,520
or potential

1253
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:29,119
attack types and this stuff helps with

1254
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:30,960
awareness training so using that and

1255
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:34,160
feeding it back into

1256
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:35,359
the um timely calms that go out to end

1257
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:38,000
users

1258
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:39,520
so um very close and i think i'm

1259
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,440
probably very too close to running over

1260
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,200
time here so apologies but look a way to

1261
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,320
think about this prioritization as we

1262
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,680
move away from

1263
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,599
you know the old-school perimeter into

1264
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,359
pervasive is

1265
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,040
uh you know what we call the zone model

1266
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:52,799
and zone one established perimeter

1267
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,160
everybody gets this it's the moat around

1268
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,880
the organization

1269
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,279
and it's protecting email against urls

1270
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,599
uh

1271
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,400
impersonation it's protecting your web

1272
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,839
traffic

1273
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,960
you know it's data loss prevention it's

1274
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,680
all those things that we're kind of used

1275
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,640
to

1276
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,399
and i'm going to say that it's moved

1277
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:08,000
from physical to much more of a logical

1278
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,800
separation these days

1279
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:13,119
um moving then to look at the actual

1280
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:15,599
perimeter or inside that i should say

1281
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:17,119
and here you're into things like um edr

1282
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,160
lots of good solutions out there

1283
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:21,440
yuba um you know av multi-factor auth

1284
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,040
all of that stuff

1285
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,640
security and awareness training fits in

1286
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,640
here and engagement

1287
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,480
and also you know quarantine remediation

1288
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:30,240
activities so if you're into sore

1289
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,520
seam type systems like that's where that

1290
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,598
fits

1291
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:34,880
and kind of has a leg into zone three

1292
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,280
which is then the kind of global thread

1293
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,680
intel

1294
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,280
proactive risk hunting something that's

1295
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,960
become pretty interesting to me is the

1296
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,560
proactive

1297
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,880
protection against things like domains

1298
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,078
that are being spun up so cousin domains

1299
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,400
where what you're trying to do is get

1300
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,920
ahead of the attack so you know using

1301
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,599
scanning of the infinite web to figure

1302
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,040
out is there a new domain that looks

1303
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,000
like one of yours that maybe has cloned

1304
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,320
your website

1305
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,160
and does it have an mx record cool let's

1306
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,480
go take it down before it becomes a

1307
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,359
a problem and then into your security

1308
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:03,200
ecosystem so

1309
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,880
again this is really across the

1310
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:06,399
perimeter but you're you're hooking into

1311
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,359
things like rapid seven

1312
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,160
recorded future uh crowdstrike paulo

1313
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:12,400
like all the

1314
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,000
the kind of vendors that are um in the

1315
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,359
the vendor kind of showroom today if

1316
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,680
anyone's gonna

1317
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:19,040
go and talk to them that's a connected

1318
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,078
ecosystem these days with the

1319
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:23,119
utilization of

1320
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,800
sock full-time employees being a pretty

1321
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,640
key kind of outcome there lowering false

1322
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,720
positives better triage

1323
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:30,319
ultimately again driving to a lower mean

1324
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,799
time to detect in the lower mean time to

1325
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:35,040
respond

1326
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,560
so look we're living through really

1327
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,400
strange times gonna say that

1328
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,000
um but i'm i'm heartened you know i've

1329
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,520
been here for 20 years and i'm hard to

1330
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:43,760
see that as a country

1331
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,960
uh we've absolutely got our priorities

1332
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,319
straight in this stuff and back to

1333
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,079
google trends

1334
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:50,160
where the the biggest shift in the you

1335
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:53,680
