the chat and i'll drop a link to the

21
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,559
survey if you wish to

thank you for making downl to let's come

23
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,800
and listen to

24
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,839
mike and myself so what we're going to

25
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,879
talk through today

26
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,640
is basically the video assert cyber

27
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,160
security survey results

28
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,680
this is our fourth year that we're

29
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,120
running the results

30
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,600
and what you want to cover off in

31
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,440
today's presentation is

32
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,119
just really have a quick discussion

33
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,600
about how the cyber

34
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,479
threat landscape has changed since the

35
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,280
last time we

36
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,000
we presented this we will talk a bit

37
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,960
about the

38
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,520
2020 australia cyber security strategy

39
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,039
um

40
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,600
and then look at the results from our

41
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,759
survey and see uh how prepared are we

42
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,720
to support or how does strategy itself

43
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,640
can actually support

44
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,840
uh australian organizations from a

45
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,840
preparedness perspective

46
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,000
so for those that actually attended last

47
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,400
year i mean i

48
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,640
did talk about the world economic forum

49
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,680
global risk landscape

50
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,880
so this report was released pre-covert

51
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,720
and what uh what came out of

52
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,119
last year which is really the results

53
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,798
from a survey and then the um

54
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,520
and the work the world and economic

55
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,759
forum was doing uh the end of last year

56
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,520
uh data fraud and theft and cyber

57
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,799
attacks is still within the top

58
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,880
10 likelihood of threats and if you look

59
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,240
at what's sort of set around

60
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,240
that from a a risk perspective extreme

61
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,000
weather events climate action failure

62
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,919
natural disasters

63
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,760
those are all types of risks where the

64
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:14,720
likelihood of actually reducing

65
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:15,679
that risk from happening is fairly low

66
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,599
so

67
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,040
we should actually start thinking about

68
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,200
cyber in the same ways and data theft

69
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,400
it seems that we're starting to lose the

70
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,280
battle of actually reducing the

71
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,000
likelihood of that

72
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,440
uh risk actually eventuate so we need to

73
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,360
start thinking about and this is what

74
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,200
some of those other

75
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,440
risks are being been looked at is how

76
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,119
how do we address them by

77
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,519
managing the impact of that risk

78
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,519
happening

79
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,518
so first thing i want to talk through is

80
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,840
just basically how

81
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,080
the sources of cyber incidents have

82
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,840
changed over the last

83
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:54,480
four years uh cyber criminal activity

84
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,239
is still the number one threat and what

85
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,159
we're showing here is percentages so

86
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,040
although it's showing a drop in the

87
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,959
number of cyber criminal organized crime

88
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,400
it's actually a result of an increase in

89
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,360
some other areas

90
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,480
and most notably there's an increase in

91
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,319
steady increase in foreign government

92
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,079
and nation-state interference in

93
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,640
organizations

94
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,480
we're also seeing a steady increase in

95
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,040
third party

96
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,238
risks or issues related to third party

97
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,400
incidents

98
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,120
as well as formal employees and

99
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,120
suppliers

100
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,319
what we've got presented here is

101
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,560
basically a question

102
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,000
where we sort of explored what incidents

103
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,000
organizations have experienced

104
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,359
in the previous year what other concerns

105
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,920
are in the coming year

106
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,519
so the graph that we've got here on the

107
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,920
left hand side the blue bars

108
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,640
basically showing what incidents were

109
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,760
experienced

110
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,399
last year when we run the survey and we

111
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,120
plotted

112
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,159
a graph of the line in yellow there

113
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,000
showing

114
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,840
same question we asked the year before

115
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,360
basically asking

116
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,280
what are your concerns in the coming

117
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,599
year and what we can see

118
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:10,319
is um there's really a mismatch between

119
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,839
the concerns around phishing so

120
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,439
organizations experience

121
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,920
experience a lot more phishing attacks

122
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:19,918
than than what they expected to

123
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:22,639
experience and likewise there was

124
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,960
a lot more concern around data breach

125
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,120
and

126
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:30,400
third party supplier risks loss of data

127
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,560
data theft and unauthorized access

128
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,440
and really my sort of takeaway from that

129
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,639
is that i don't think

130
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,960
organizations really have an

131
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,440
appreciation and understanding on

132
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,440
how good the security uh is actually of

133
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,840
those trusted individuals or trusted

134
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,840
organizations

135
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,479
so we've actually got our own statistics

136
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,120
that we run

137
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,159
separate to the bdo and offset cyber

138
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,400
security survey

139
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,160
and these of course are from our members

140
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,440
um which are in australia and some

141
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,840
surrounding nations

142
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,360
now the interesting thing is um it

143
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:06,159
correlates so guess what

144
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,160
fishing is right at the top um now

145
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,560
that's by volume of course we have

146
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,000
um you know incidents that that are

147
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,039
suffered by members that are

148
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,919
far higher impact but in

149
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,719
a far less volume so focusing though on

150
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,039
fishing

151
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,400
it's uh it's interesting to see that if

152
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,400
you look at our statistics

153
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,880
um just ignore through for a moment the

154
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,560
fact that in 2016 it sort of dips down

155
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,240
into 2017 again

156
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,880
that was actually due to a change in the

157
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,720
way that we uh do our own reporting so

158
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,479
it became far more accurate

159
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,639
um but you can still see that the the

160
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,960
trend is up up and up

161
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,560
so um we've we've been collecting this

162
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,159
data for a very long time and it

163
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,520
correlates directly with what we're

164
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,479
seeing in the um

165
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,758
the bdo survey um i've personally seen

166
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,960
this change from

167
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,800
pure financial gain to um you know more

168
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,758
targeted attacks like business email

169
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,560
compromise

170
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,240
and we've seen it spin on to to other

171
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,080
areas like universities

172
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,160
where the the target of course is

173
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,639
intellectual property research

174
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,000
and uh you know obviously the there's

175
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,840
been a bit of a shift in in that

176
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,199
community to counter the threat

177
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,359
we've seen some interesting changes in

178
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,560
the technology behind defenses for

179
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,800
phishing as well

180
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,759
um for example where we're now

181
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,600
electronic

182
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,759
electronically connected with a lot of

183
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,520
our members and we're able to

184
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:28,000
send out notifications or or

185
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,159
indicators of compromise to allow them

186
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,240
to defend themselves against it

187
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,199
we've also got some very interesting

188
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,520
in-house

189
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,560
phishing tracking tools that can capture

190
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:39,120
artifacts

191
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,800
very rapidly one of our own senior

192
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,479
analysts actually designed that system

193
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,680
that we're using internally

194
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,159
it's called osprey and that's the

195
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,840
subject of another whole presentation

196
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,840
i'll hand back to you leon

197
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,560
thank you mike so what we want to do now

198
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,560
is um just look at the

199
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,840
2020 cyber security strategy that got

200
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,319
released

201
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,318
a couple of weeks back so there was a

202
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,800
number of

203
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,000
consultation sessions with industry and

204
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,400
one of this put down

205
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,639
uh some of the takeaways in some of the

206
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,000
sessions that uh that we attended

207
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:16,800
um on on the challenges that uh

208
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,840
those that sort of participated in

209
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,160
workshops

210
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,840
was really around clarification on the

211
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,800
roles and responsibilities around cyber

212
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,520
security

213
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,440
especially what's the responsibility of

214
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,880
industry what's responsibility of of

215
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,080
government

216
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,680
i think it was a lot of discussions

217
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,400
around uh that small businesses are

218
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,280
particularly

219
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,638
vulnerable um there was a lot of

220
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,280
discussion about

221
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,759
how can industry and government really

222
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,000
sort of

223
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,440
partner together and strengthen those

224
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,840
relationships because

225
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,960
cyber security is a team sport if we all

226
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,000
go at it alone

227
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,000
we're not going to be successful

228
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,240
there was some discussions about how do

229
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,039
we get more standards and regulation in

230
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,440
place

231
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,599
just to sort of help inform getting some

232
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:02,319
of the basics right

233
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,878
human behavior or awareness training

234
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,400
that was

235
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,840
a problem that was highlighted and

236
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,000
needed some guidance in the strategy to

237
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,599
address that

238
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,440
there was an acknowledgement that a lot

239
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,080
of threats can actually be addressed at

240
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,560
scale

241
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,680
so discussions about service providers

242
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,759
how can they actually block some

243
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,400
malicious activity at the source rather

244
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,400
than

245
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,719
you sort of get through um through the

246
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,719
gate

247
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,799
communication sort of ties back to the

248
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,000
roles and responsibilities

249
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,759
i wanted to get some clarity on uh if

250
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,640
threats are identified making sure that

251
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:36,719
we actually shared in in both directions

252
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,240
and then i think the last thing that

253
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,039
there was a lot of discussion about is

254
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,919
how does

255
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,039
we as industry actually prepare um to

256
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,079
actually respond to a

257
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:48,399
a national security incident so

258
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,480
effectively what what was put together

259
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:52,959
uh is a strategy that sort of

260
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,720
covered a number of themes across what

261
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,479
government action is going to be

262
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,040
what business needs to be responsible

263
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,440
for and and the community at large

264
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,319
and i'll sort of go through a little bit

265
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,640
more detail

266
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:09,839
and show how the strategy actually

267
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,839
aligns to that

268
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:18,319
so oscar also um analyzed

269
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
the australian government strategy and

270
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,320
we actually wrote a little blog piece on

271
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,519
it

272
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,800
which effectively distills the um 60

273
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,760
points and and some 50 pages worth of

274
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,479
information

275
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,480
down to five key things and you can see

276
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,600
them on the slide here in front of us

277
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,360
um we did that because we we obviously

278
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,880
believe very strongly in this but we we

279
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,600
also wanted to make this as simple as

280
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,519
possible

281
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,959
for our members to sort of understand

282
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,440
where do they fit in

283
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,880
um now it's important to note you know

284
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,880
we're not the be all and end all

285
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,080
vendors aren't the be all and end all

286
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,560
this is

287
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,440
one step towards a nation that's coming

288
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,479
together

289
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,720
to achieve cyber security resilience

290
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,240
and the reason you might want to have a

291
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,040
little read of our blog is it's a very

292
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,200
short way

293
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,800
to sort of understand well here's what i

294
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,240
can do in my organization

295
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:10,719
towards that that goal um we've been

296
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,640
obviously contributing um in terms of

297
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,079
things like deterrence for a very long

298
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,160
time we've got

299
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,000
roots going back some 27 years as a

300
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,240
cyber emergency response team

301
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,200
but what we've seen in in recent years

302
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,440
certainly the time

303
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,399
that i've been here at osset we've seen

304
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,560
a real shift

305
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,200
in in focus from our our members

306
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,839
expecting much more on the

307
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,279
prevention and detection side of things

308
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,760
and of course that's where

309
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,320
threat intelligence comes in and it's

310
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,000
certainly

311
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,440
where we focused a lot of our our

312
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,440
energies um

313
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,959
if you're looking at things that you can

314
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,000
do in your organizations

315
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:48,319
um obviously resilience is is is the key

316
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,240
here and you know just looking at us you

317
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:53,279
know we we belong to a couple of

318
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,560
um forums like the the asia pacific um

319
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,079
cert teams uh we also belong to uh first

320
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,199
the forum of incident response and

321
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,760
security teams

322
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,040
um they're not exclusive um you know you

323
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,959
can belong to

324
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,040
organizations like that you can visit

325
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:10,160
your own jcsc and

326
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:13,519
or your local acer branch um to actually

327
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:16,000
participate in in some of those forums

328
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:17,839
if if you if you do that great if you

329
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,880
invest in cyber security

330
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:24,000
um even better we're investing

331
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:26,000
um what what very small uh surplus we

332
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,720
have being a not-for-profit organization

333
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,959
obviously

334
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,920
what small surplus we have will go back

335
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,160
into

336
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,319
team training so that that's how we

337
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,519
provide an investment to cyber security

338
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,680
here

339
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:42,240
thanks leon thank you mike

340
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,120
so what what we wanted to do now is to

341
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,519
actually see

342
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,240
given the the new revised cyber security

343
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:49,279
strategy

344
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:51,519
um what's our statistics from the survey

345
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,560
actually saying about um what's

346
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,760
happening in the industry

347
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:57,040
and how prepared are we to sort of

348
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,279
respond to the increased threat

349
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,639
landscape

350
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:05,360
so to take a step back

351
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:07,519
i think for a good security strategy and

352
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,120
is not analyzing the the

353
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:10,800
2020 government strategy that got

354
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,639
released this is more about

355
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,040
organization that wants to put in place

356
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,800
a capability to

357
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,240
ensure that they have got a strong

358
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:23,599
security function or they uh

359
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,000
they are able to be resilient to manage

360
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,160
the threat

361
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,040
environment really there's four main

362
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,800
areas that

363
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,399
that i think organizations need to look

364
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,000
at is i think the first one is around

365
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,760
getting strong leadership

366
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,279
and that means that you need to build a

367
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:37,600
security capability that

368
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,720
has got the right security objectives

369
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:41,440
which really is based

370
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:42,720
on making sure that it aligns to

371
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:45,200
business objectives

372
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,720
because end of the day if the security

373
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,440
capability is not supporting the

374
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,560
business

375
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,639
you're not going to achieve the right

376
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,560
outcome so really making sure you've got

377
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,399
that strong leadership in place

378
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,000
the next thing is around making sure

379
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,279
that there's a good understanding and a

380
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,519
thorough understanding on

381
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:01,279
um on the threat environment so it's

382
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,680
really about preparing and understanding

383
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,760
what are the threats and risks that's

384
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,000
related to the organization

385
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,680
once that's understood it's about making

386
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,440
sure that

387
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,439
the right protection is putting in place

388
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,600
to sort of manage

389
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,480
and protect those critical information

390
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,639
assets

391
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:23,519
that the organization operate now

392
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:24,720
because of the the inherent risk and um

393
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,279
the complexity of

394
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,720
of the cyber landscape that's changing i

395
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:32,720
mean referring back to the

396
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:35,600
um the the world economic forum

397
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:37,200
slide that i showed before it's it's

398
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,360
starting to get quite difficult to

399
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:41,440
manage the likelihood that you're going

400
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,399
to be suffering a cyber attack so really

401
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,040
it's about

402
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,399
the last thing is to be prepared that if

403
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,719
a cyber incident or event

404
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,560
actually that we do have the right

405
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,440
defense mechanisms in place to be able

406
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,160
to

407
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,959
respond to that so really for me in a

408
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,639
nutshell there's four key things that

409
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,319
needs to be in place to establish a good

410
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,240
security capability

411
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,480
so what i'll do now is actually for all

412
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,519
four of those um sort of analyze

413
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,240
how the 2020 cyber security strategy is

414
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,880
supporting

415
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,920
uh organizations to be able to um sort

416
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,920
of achieve that

417
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,439
a better and a stronger security

418
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,439
capability

419
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,800
so the first one is as i said it's about

420
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,160
setting direction

421
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,959
and look at some of the things coming

422
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:25,760
out of the 2020 strategy

423
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,040
uh some of the actions that government

424
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,800
is sort of going to undertake is to

425
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,120
strengthen those partnerships that we

426
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,880
talked about so really it's about

427
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,120
seeing a direction and providing some

428
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,320
leadership and guidance on what good

429
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,519
looks like

430
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,519
and also support about around

431
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,959
establishing and enhancing security

432
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,480
capabilities

433
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,279
if you look at what businesses need to

434
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,040
do to be able to set that direction

435
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,279
i think one of the things coming out

436
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:53,439
there is the uplift of

437
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,320
cyber security capability in small to

438
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,519
medium-sized

439
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,160
enterprises as well as also businesses

440
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,519
need to be

441
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,040
able to grow a skilled workforce

442
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,959
and if you look at what the community

443
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,880
can do from a uh

444
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,638
direction perspective is about getting

445
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,160
access and apply guidance to

446
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:15,120
um to good information security

447
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:18,240
and also have the ability to get help

448
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,240
and support we need it

449
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:23,839
so if we look at the results that from

450
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,839
our survey

451
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,360
the main four areas which is about

452
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:29,920
direction is

453
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,639
four things that we sort of looked at is

454
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,439
what sort of

455
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,199
risk reporting and communications is

456
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,279
provided on a regular basis to the

457
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,479
boards and executives

458
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,560
whether there's a a chief or a um

459
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,000
someone responsible at a senior level

460
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:46,959
for security which is your

461
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,399
ciso policies in place and then

462
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,839
awareness training

463
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,600
and what we've seen is over the last

464
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,839
number of years there's been a

465
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,120
increase in that but it's it's so

466
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,240
interesting to see that still

467
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,720
less than um 60 of all just over 60

468
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,920
of organizations the management of

469
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,199
boards getting regular

470
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:07,279
updates on cyber security not many

471
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:09,120
organizations have got a chief or a

472
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,079
senior person responsible for security

473
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,440
so

474
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,279
later servant results are showing that

475
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,399
is less than 40 percent

476
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:18,320
um policy is about making sure there's

477
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,440
these clear guidance on on what goods

478
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,320
look like

479
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:24,000
and from the survey results only 80 of

480
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,120
organizations typically would have that

481
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,240
in place

482
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,040
um and it's just less than 80 really um

483
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,880
is investing in education and training

484
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,040
so really from a direction perspective

485
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,720
um there's some work that still

486
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,360
organizations need to do

487
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,120
it's really about i think owners need to

488
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,560
take more responsibility in setting a

489
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:45,680
direction of

490
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,319
where security needs to go

491
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,239
so what we've looked at is to say for

492
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:53,839
those organizations that actually

493
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:55,279
um have got a close alignment with their

494
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,320
security capability to business

495
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,839
objectives

496
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,839
so it's really where management is

497
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,160
really involved in that

498
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,839
we see there is a lot more confidence in

499
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,000
those organizations

500
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,839
in the ability to actually meet the

501
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,640
changing threat landscape

502
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,559
and that really signal um and shows that

503
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,079
there's a

504
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,918
the right alignment and those

505
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,959
organizations know which areas they need

506
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,240
to invest

507
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,240
too straight from the environment

508
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,439
so in terms of providing that level of

509
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,760
leadership

510
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,960
at different levels of of your

511
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,559
organization

512
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,880
we we actually talk to a lot of our

513
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,960
members about

514
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,039
how they fit into the the greater piece

515
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,720
of the puzzle of cyber security in their

516
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,440
organization

517
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,240
we've obviously seen in recent years a

518
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,039
big shift

519
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,200
in senior management sea levels taking

520
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:49,280
an active interest in cyber security

521
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,480
um now obviously their that their

522
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,000
portfolio is huge and

523
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,799
they're not interested in detailed

524
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,160
analysis but what they are interested in

525
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,120
is uh timely and uh and relevant

526
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,760
information

527
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,000
now uh there's obviously a lot of media

528
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,840
coverage these days of cyber security

529
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,760
and that's not where you know your

530
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,439
senior manager wants to find out

531
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,039
that well they've had a breach in their

532
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,799
own organization or

533
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,879
that there is some new vulnerability out

534
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:17,440
that might affect their organization

535
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,640
so their expectation obviously is that

536
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,039
that information

537
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,360
is available from you if you're you know

538
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:26,400
a mid-level manager or an

539
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,039
analyst in their organization in order

540
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,760
to

541
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:31,600
uh to do that better most mid-level

542
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,520
managers then have to sort of look at

543
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,719
well i need to have a

544
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,720
a copy and paste ready to go from

545
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,240
you know some trusted authority and you

546
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:41,600
know many cases with our members

547
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,240
obviously that's us

548
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,600
where we actually provide at least

549
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,320
enough information that they can

550
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,159
effectively

551
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,360
copy paste and send that to their senior

552
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,520
management um

553
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,360
to make them aware of the threats that

554
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,080
are being faced

555
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:58,080
now i've actually had a couple of um

556
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,320
cios say to me

557
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,760
if you know if you only read one thing

558
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:03,760
you know you read

559
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,960
oscert's idea the daily intelligence

560
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,000
report or you read

561
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,960
aces news roundup or something like that

562
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,559
um those sorts of of communications are

563
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,240
obviously exceedingly important

564
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,678
to bridge that gap between all these

565
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,240
levels if you go

566
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:20,000
um you know to the the level of the

567
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,160
people that are actually on the tools

568
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,480
um they don't want to have to do any

569
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,679
research they haven't got time

570
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,520
and this is what all our members are

571
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,640
telling us i would i just want something

572
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,440
that it's in its

573
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,520
final form so i don't have to you know

574
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,679
reanalyze it or recontextualize it i

575
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:38,080
want something that's relevant to me

576
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,520
that i can then hopefully plug

577
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,360
electronically into some

578
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,240
platform or existing system that will

579
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,399
just ingest it and do its thing

580
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,000
interestingly though we've seen probably

581
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,679
in recent times

582
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,000
a real shift in what i would call the

583
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,520
soft

584
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,640
skills i suppose so um some areas like

585
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:59,600
human resources

586
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,640
or um project management or those sorts

587
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,039
of areas that

588
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,559
aren't as technical as as cyber security

589
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,320
or pure it

590
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,320
are taking an interest in learning the

591
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,080
basics of cyber security

592
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,360
so that they have that that level of

593
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,240
awareness

594
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:16,559
across the entire organization thanks

595
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,559
leon

596
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:22,719
thank you mike so next thing we want to

597
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:25,440
look at is um

598
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,039
if organizations really understand uh

599
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,679
what's at risk

600
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,480
so if you look at the strategy um and

601
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:32,320
what

602
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,679
sort of guidance and direction it's

603
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,158
going to provided there

604
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,960
from a government perspective it is

605
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:42,080
providing support to businesses to meet

606
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:44,000
baseline cyber security standards the

607
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,120
business responsibilities highlighted in

608
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,080
the strategy is

609
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,760
around how does organizations improve

610
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,840
baseline security off of critical

611
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,240
infrastructure

612
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,799
and then the community itself is getting

613
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:59,440
guidance on information security

614
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,158
ensuring they make informed purchasing

615
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,880
decisions

616
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:05,280
in buying products that's of better

617
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,400
security quality

618
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:10,158
now looking at the um the survey results

619
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,720
and what we're seeing there from a

620
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:13,280
understanding of risk and what we sort

621
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,240
of

622
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,120
analyzed here is really around the level

623
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,880
of

624
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,799
it or cyber security standards and

625
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,520
policies in place for

626
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,039
third party providers having baseline

627
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,080
security standards in place

628
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:31,280
doing regular risk assessments

629
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:34,320
analyzing third parties uh etc

630
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:37,280
and what we can see here is on average

631
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,520
um it's fairly low lower maturity than

632
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,840
what we were hoping for

633
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,679
on the average of 60 of organizations

634
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,959
have got those baseline standards in

635
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,840
place to say

636
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:49,840
this is really what goods look like and

637
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,678
also they're actually following up

638
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,120
i mean for me cloud security standards

639
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:54,080
there's there's a whole heap of those

640
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,479
you can

641
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,280
sort of adopt off of the internet and

642
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,559
the same for

643
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,840
third-party vendors so really i think

644
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,678
there's a bit more work to be done

645
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,080
around setting those baseline standards

646
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,679
and

647
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,439
to see initiatives in the strategy to

648
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,559
say

649
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,480
government's going to get involved to

650
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,678
define what those standards are

651
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:16,480
is really a good outcome

652
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,520
so if you look at those organizations

653
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,440
that actually

654
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:24,000
has defined a baseline

655
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,720
risk requirement or a standard and doing

656
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:29,919
regular risk assessments the impact

657
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,640
of a cyber security incident

658
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,000
is significantly reduced compared to um

659
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,000
to those that actually

660
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,440
do not have those baseline standards in

661
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,960
place

662
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,440
and just some of the stats we're seeing

663
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,440
there is that

664
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,360
those with not that in place actually

665
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:48,960
experiencing uh

666
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:51,280
double or twice amount of ransomware

667
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,960
business email compromise for those

668
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,000
organizations who do not have that risk

669
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,120
visibility

670
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,039
and that's that's really a threat we're

671
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:59,439
starting to see coming through

672
00:22:57,039 --> 00:23:00,559
so really um i think an organization is

673
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,840
putting

674
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:05,120
the effort in to understand and define

675
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,280
what goods look like

676
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,959
i think a lot of threats would be

677
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:11,120
addressed or honestly in a much easier

678
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,120
way

679
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,480
and indeed we've certainly seen um

680
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:19,200
across our members we've seen

681
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,400
it becoming a relatively normal business

682
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,559
function now

683
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,640
that you know cyber security risk is is

684
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:27,280
just woven into all processes

685
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,960
um there's one one or two i'd like to

686
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,399
call out in particular where we've seen

687
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,960
this done very well

688
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,799
um we'll talk first of all about our own

689
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,720
sector the higher education sector

690
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:38,080
um for those that don't know osset

691
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,960
actually sits within one of the

692
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,399
universities

693
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,159
uq um and also for those that don't know

694
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,400
there is an umbrella organization

695
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,760
called cordet the council of australian

696
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:51,039
directors of i.t

697
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,720
which is funded by the sector across all

698
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,080
the universities and they've

699
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,120
for years they've done things like group

700
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,720
procurement for it

701
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,439
coordinated professional development

702
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:03,440
that sort of stuff but obviously they've

703
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,880
realized recently that cyber security is

704
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,760
important and they've

705
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,919
effectively set up a branch within

706
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,520
quarter to to handle that

707
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,520
we obviously play a very big part of

708
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,080
that considering

709
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,039
who we are but what we've seen actually

710
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,039
is is

711
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:21,279
they're now looking at the the elements

712
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:23,279
that that we can't do or shouldn't do

713
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,960
uh things like uh risk assessments

714
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,640
across the sector for

715
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,799
uh vendors that are common to all

716
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:30,240
universities so actually pooling those

717
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:32,480
resources instead of 40

718
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:34,480
odd universities doing a risk assessment

719
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:38,000
of blackboard the the

720
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,440
system they use for classes online

721
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,039
maybe just do that once and share it

722
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:43,520
across the entire sector

723
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,960
so we're seeing that done extremely well

724
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,879
certainly within the

725
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,480
university sector but another one i'd

726
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,200
call out is

727
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,799
in in the state government sector i'll

728
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,080
mention victoria because i think they

729
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:56,080
need all the love they can get at the

730
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,360
moment considering what's going on

731
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,039
but other state governments are doing

732
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,240
this as well and they've actually taken

733
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,039
the approach that

734
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:04,480
no risk management is is something the

735
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,600
government is putting the hand up the

736
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,559
state government's putting their hands

737
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:09,760
up to do

738
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:12,000
and if you are a local council or

739
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,200
a statutory body or or a state

740
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,120
government department

741
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,480
uh you know we're we're here to help in

742
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,799
a collective way

743
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,400
so that's certainly a change that we've

744
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:23,840
seen recently that

745
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:26,080
we think is for the the positive um

746
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,320
not dwelling on negative but there are

747
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,000
still a couple of industries that see

748
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:31,520
cyber security either as a competitive

749
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,600
advantage or

750
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:35,200
one that isn't meant to be shared and

751
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,678
you know that really doesn't help anyone

752
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,279
so

753
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,080
if you're in such an industry and you

754
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:43,120
want to start some kind of

755
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:45,039
collaboration or or effort maybe just

756
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,799
pop into your local jcsc or something

757
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:51,200
and see what you can start

758
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:54,720
thanks leon thank you mike

759
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,880
so what i want to look at now is

760
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,919
what sort of activities and strategies

761
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,360
uh been

762
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,039
proposed to put in place to actually

763
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,479
reduce the likelihood of that risk

764
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,279
eventuate

765
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,400
and um there's a lot of activities

766
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:08,880
putting the strategy

767
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,799
uh forward um so from a government

768
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,000
perspective is about protecting credit

769
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,600
infrastructure and essential services um

770
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,039
again strengthening those cyber security

771
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,199
partnerships

772
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,240
uh support business to meet those cyber

773
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:24,000
security standards

774
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:26,480
enhanced capabilities from a a

775
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,760
business perspective a whole heap of

776
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,120
activities

777
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,600
again it's about improving those

778
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:35,120
baseline security capabilities

779
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:38,959
uplift security of smes

780
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:42,080
provide secure products and services

781
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:45,200
take activity to sort of block malicious

782
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,879
activity at scale and then from a

783
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,720
community perspective

784
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,039
somebody standing out there is making

785
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,760
informed purchase decisions

786
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:54,559
so if we look at the survey results and

787
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,679
what we're seeing

788
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:59,520
from from that is um if you look at some

789
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:01,279
of the controls that's

790
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,840
that that's been put in place to manage

791
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:06,880
the the likelihood of a risk

792
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:10,240
what's interesting is to see those big

793
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,760
sort of peaks around antivirus and email

794
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,840
which shows that there's still a high

795
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,600
reliance on um

796
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:20,720
on sort of blocking malware or putting

797
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,559
secure email in place but that's not

798
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:24,880
really working because

799
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,158
phishing email and malware is still seen

800
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,360
as the highest threat

801
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:29,360
identified coming through

802
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,600
that graph that i showed about where the

803
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:36,479
concerns are coming from from

804
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:40,000
organizations which relates to

805
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:42,799
enterprise access to to systems uh

806
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,080
loss of data if you look at those sort

807
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,480
of controls

808
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,080
around private account management data

809
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,060
loss prevention

810
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,279
ids

811
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:54,080
[Music]

812
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:55,520
prevention systems fairly low maturity

813
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,080
compared to the rest so

814
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,720
um on average um sort of between 50 and

815
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,520
60

816
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,000
maturity which shows that there's still

817
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:04,240
room for

818
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,720
improvement to really strengthen those

819
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,720
controls

820
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:09,919
so if you look at again organizations

821
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,320
that

822
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:14,840
are fairly confident in meeting their

823
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:17,918
security capability

824
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:20,000
um are really those that

825
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,679
have spent a lot of time focusing on

826
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,120
understanding their risk

827
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:27,600
and really it shows that

828
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,439
investing in understanding what your

829
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,959
risks are putting the right controls in

830
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,559
place

831
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,880
do make organizations feel more

832
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:39,200
confident that they actually ready to

833
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,200
uh sort of respond to the latest threats

834
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,360
so one of the things that you can do in

835
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:49,039
your organization obviously

836
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:51,039
is um bi-directional threat sharing with

837
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,799
with others now that doesn't have to be

838
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,120
necessarily the government or a vendor

839
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,679
or

840
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,080
or anyone in particular it might simply

841
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,520
be within your sector

842
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,279
there's a couple of good examples of

843
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,799
that already occurring in in this

844
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,080
country that the banks for example have

845
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:07,279
been doing it now for

846
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,639
a good 15 years or more not all sectors

847
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,399
do it

848
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,840
i talked a bit earlier in this

849
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,439
presentation about

850
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,279
cordet which is the council of

851
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:19,600
australian directors of i.t

852
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:22,080
and how they have established a separate

853
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,360
capability for cyber security for the

854
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,120
sector

855
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,639
one of the ways that we contributed very

856
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:29,039
significantly in that

857
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,360
was actually building an isac an

858
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:34,799
information sharing and analysis center

859
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,639
now we did it others have done it it can

860
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:38,480
be done in any sector

861
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,039
the way we did it if anyone's interested

862
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:43,200
in you know how you actually go about it

863
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,879
ask others there's a wonderful

864
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,279
organization over in the united states

865
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,120
in

866
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,880
indiana university called the

867
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,760
renaissance the research and education

868
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,559
network

869
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:54,000
isac and we just spent a bit of time

870
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,158
with them and they were very willing to

871
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,440
teach and the biggest piece of advice

872
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:00,720
they actually gave us was

873
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:03,120
don't try to boil the ocean just choose

874
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,120
one thing that you can do and do well

875
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,719
and then share that within the sector

876
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,719
and then you'll increase the cyber

877
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,960
security resilience just by doing that

878
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:13,679
so the way we chose to do that was

879
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,720
sharing indicators of compromise

880
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:19,840
in a closed community and we're using

881
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:21,200
circles platform misp malware

882
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:23,039
information sharing platform

883
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,320
circle is the luxembourg computer

884
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,120
emergency response team

885
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,240
it's open source anyone can use it

886
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,080
there's a lot of people that are

887
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:33,120
experienced now in using it

888
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,720
and that is one way that you can in your

889
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:37,039
organization you can

890
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:39,120
contribute bilaterally with other

891
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,520
organizations and share threats

892
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,039
in order to reduce those those risks

893
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,918
that you you face

894
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,879
um this is uh this is certainly one of

895
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,000
the things that

896
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,640
we're very proud of um i i think

897
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,279
um it would be great to see some support

898
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,720
from

899
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,960
uh particularly the government to do

900
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,519
this in some other sectors as well

901
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:59,519
thanks leon

902
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:04,960
so the last area we want to look at is

903
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:08,479
really about

904
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:09,919
understanding uh what sort of activities

905
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,039
has been proposed around insulin

906
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,120
resilience so that's a

907
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:14,960
it's about the ability to respond and

908
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:17,120
recover from that

909
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,000
and that's really looking at reducing

910
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,678
the the risk

911
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,200
impact and if you look at some of the

912
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,399
activities that the strategies

913
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,399
is proposing to um to look at is a nice

914
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,760
segue into what mike was just talking

915
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,120
about there is the share of threat

916
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,399
information

917
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,799
again he's strengthening those cyber

918
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:34,639
security partnerships and enhance the

919
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:37,360
security capabilities

920
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,480
um similar for business improve both

921
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:41,439
line security

922
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,519
by using that threat information to

923
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:47,120
support where to

924
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:49,200
do investment in your security controls

925
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,879
and then also it's about understanding

926
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,559
where the threats are coming from

927
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,279
you can then sort of block those

928
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:58,000
malicious activity at scale

929
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,320
and then from a community perspective i

930
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,600
think

931
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:03,279
the one that that's coming in there is

932
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:05,360
about reporting cyber crime

933
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:06,480
so if you look at the survey results and

934
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,959
specific areas that

935
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,240
uh that sort of resonate with this is

936
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,840
around to having the

937
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:14,080
um having incident response plans in

938
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,959
place

939
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,918
having the technology in place to sort

940
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,320
of detect

941
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:22,080
incidents which is a seam and a security

942
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,480
operation center

943
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,080
uh and then have the capability to sort

944
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,840
of respond to that using response

945
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,439
capability

946
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,879
and if you look at overall those are

947
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,880
still at a fairly low maturity

948
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,000
incident response plans have made

949
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:39,279
significant

950
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,440
improvements over the last sort of

951
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:42,640
four years and i think the main reasons

952
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,960
for that is uh

953
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,240
the mandatory data breach notification

954
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,760
requirements from the privacy

955
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,440
legislation

956
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:51,360
required that organizations actually

957
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,399
have processes in place to

958
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,240
report uh data breaches

959
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:57,760
so that's why we've seen an increase

960
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,200
there

961
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,640
i think for me the interesting part is

962
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,600
business continuity and disaster

963
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,519
recovery

964
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,799
those activities that's been around for

965
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,200
four decades

966
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:09,279
and still what we see there is is fairly

967
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:12,799
low maturity and if you look at

968
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:16,000
some of the ransomware impact to sort of

969
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,799
reduce the impact of that is to have a

970
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,159
good

971
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:21,600
uh an operational bcp or disaster

972
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:23,600
recovery plan in place

973
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:26,639
we're still seeing a fairly low maturity

974
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:28,879
level of those less than 80 percent

975
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:32,159
means that organizations need to spend

976
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,159
more time on investing in that

977
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,559
um sort of just to lead into what mike

978
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,760
was talking about

979
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:41,600
that threat intelligence capability so

980
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,200
what we've seen is those organizations

981
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,918
that actually have got

982
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,919
more mature

983
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:49,840
capability in place around threat

984
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:54,559
intelligence

985
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:56,158
are actually detecting incidents earlier

986
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:58,000
and actually make them more resilient

987
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,440
and capable to respond to that so across

988
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,760
the broad

989
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,519
we've seen those with actually threat

990
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,840
intelligence capability are able to

991
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:08,639
detect

992
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:10,159
those instant those cyber events before

993
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,560
it actually becomes an incident needs to

994
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:16,639
be dealt with

995
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:18,799
indeed although the sheer volume of

996
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:21,599
incidents that a lot of our members are

997
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:24,879
facing is is really the challenge here

998
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:26,720
and um i suppose

999
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,719
someone should make a conference about

1000
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,719
this um you know you need some kind of

1001
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,799
super action here or something to

1002
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:35,040
come flying in and save the day because

1003
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,480
it's it's just so overwhelming

1004
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,759
um i'll use an example of the indicators

1005
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,879
of vulnerability and indicators of

1006
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,359
compromise that

1007
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:44,239
we send out to our members on a daily

1008
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:46,560
basis

1009
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:48,399
um the scale of it is so big that you

1010
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,599
know we have to use a logarithmic scale

1011
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,279
on the graph because

1012
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:53,359
some of the vulnerabilities are so big

1013
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,760
some are not as big

1014
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:56,639
um but it's it's just interesting to see

1015
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,040
that there is

1016
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,640
literally you know hundreds of thousands

1017
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,040
of these going out

1018
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,640
um to adjust to our members now members

1019
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,200
you can see there on the graph our

1020
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,279
members

1021
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,439
do cover a very large section of

1022
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:11,520
australia but it's not all of australia

1023
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,960
so if if you're in a position where

1024
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,720
you're you know defending your

1025
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,960
organization

1026
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:18,720
you're obviously faced with a massive

1027
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,280
volume so how do you actually

1028
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,879
uh break that down and and bring it to

1029
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:25,200
something a little more manageable

1030
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,160
um obviously a risk-based approach and

1031
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,598
that that's what

1032
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,160
leon's been talking about all the way

1033
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,599
through here but look at look at some of

1034
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,598
the the statistics here

1035
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,200
we're saying that you know fishing is is

1036
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,119
one of the top incidents

1037
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,520
um ensure that there can be some

1038
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:42,000
significant impacts from fishing

1039
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,119
but one of the smallest incident numbers

1040
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,920
that we deal with

1041
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:48,800
are things like actual compromises so

1042
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:51,040
compared to hundreds of thousands of

1043
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,480
say vulnerable services in an indicator

1044
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:55,839
of compromise

1045
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,160
data feed there might be hundreds

1046
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:01,200
of investigations that we're actually

1047
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:04,000
doing into a real compromised host

1048
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,720
so that tells me one of two things

1049
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,119
either

1050
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,000
people are very quickly remediating the

1051
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:09,760
problems

1052
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,240
or there are a lot of problems that

1053
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,880
aren't actually being addressed so

1054
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,078
um the advice would be take a risk-based

1055
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,200
approach to

1056
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,480
the the incidents that your

1057
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,240
organization's facing um and use what

1058
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,920
intelligence there is out there and it's

1059
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,640
not just us of course i'm just using

1060
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,560
examples

1061
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,160
from our statistics there's plenty of

1062
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,560
other ways that you can find out what

1063
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,759
your

1064
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,759
organization is facing ask someone for

1065
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:37,280
help and you'll certainly find it

1066
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,359
and that is all from me thank you leon

1067
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,599
thank you mike i think that's that sort

1068
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:44,560
of concludes uh our presentation

1069
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:48,160
um so uh thank you for your time and

1070
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,160
we'll be taking some questions now

1071
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,760
