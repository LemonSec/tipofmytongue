1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,439
this afternoon we have john peter

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,600
hayward from heritage bank

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,120
talking about cyber exposure and risk

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,080
mitigation from a regional bank's

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,758
perspective

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:13,280
and discussing some of the interesting

7
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,920
challenges that he's had

8
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,680
in a small banking environment which may

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,119
or may not surprise some of us

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,320
just a reminder if your video starts to

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,920
freeze up

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,359
refresh your browser or possibly even

13
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,160
restart chrome

14
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,880
otherwise enjoy the afternoon session

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,320
over to you

16
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,399
jp thanks pete um

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,559
thank you everybody for coming along and

18
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,920
and watching my presentation today

19
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,078
um so i'll just make sure that

20
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:44,160
we've got everything good and going here

21
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,239
so um

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,599
i thought i just start off with a little

23
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,239
bit about who i am

24
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,520
and uh in case there's people out there

25
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,640
that don't really know me or haven't

26
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,840
come across me

27
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,640
which is entirely likely so my name is

28
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,640
jp

29
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,160
and i'm the information security manager

30
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,440
at heritage bank

31
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,640
and i do a lot of things but some of the

32
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,280
things that i've done

33
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,439
at my time at the bank i've built up a

34
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,840
new infosec team so i started that from

35
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,080
scratch

36
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,720
i as part of that also established um

37
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,439
the same function for the bank and

38
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,000
implemented

39
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,000
24 7 monitoring so we're watching for

40
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,840
stuff around the clock

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,119
uh we also established and designed our

42
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,400
sock

43
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:31,040
both from a physical uh

44
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,520
how the room looks and and is laid out

45
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,479
which

46
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,240
which was a bit of fun um we were going

47
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,720
through a stage where everybody had

48
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,360
facing desks throughout the organization

49
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,280
and

50
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,479
we had to convince our our facilities

51
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,799
team that we actually needed to be

52
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,759
facing the same way to see the screens

53
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,799
but also that the processes be behind

54
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,119
the sock

55
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:54,000
and the tool i was the cps234 project

56
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,399
league so when

57
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,840
apra announced uh the new piece of

58
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,280
compliance was coming out

59
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,360
i was behind the project team to make

60
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,880
sure that was all squared away

61
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,640
and i also chair the vulnerability

62
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,160
response team which is

63
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,080
reasonably relevant for today's talk and

64
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,760
uh in my spare time one of the things i

65
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,879
do is i run the tomorrow chapter of sex

66
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,799
talks

67
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,160
so just on a side note if you're looking

68
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,520
for somewhere to talk we'd be more than

69
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,720
welcome

70
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,840
to have you come and have a chat if

71
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,480
anyone's out there always looking for

72
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,680
speakers

73
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,760
so a little bit about heritage so

74
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,040
not everybody has come across heritage

75
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,399
and

76
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,879
we've got a long history we're actually

77
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,480
one of the largest customer owned banks

78
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,160
in australia and one of the longest

79
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,399
running in the country so

80
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,560
we have been around for a long time way

81
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,879
back in 1875

82
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,400
we first started as a building society

83
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,799
and we had a few mergers and

84
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,720
things along the way and we became

85
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,560
heritage building society

86
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,160
way back in the 80s um in 83 we built

87
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,840
the head office building where it is now

88
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,920
downtown toowoomba

89
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,080
so for those of you who don't know uh

90
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,760
it's kind of west of brisbane

91
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,000
uh out in the countryside on top of the

92
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,840
hill and it's a great little spot

93
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,840
and you get out of the rat race of the

94
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,120
city that's for sure

95
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,440
and in 2011 uh we became a bank

96
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,040
although we maintain our customer owned

97
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,120
structure which is quite important

98
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,599
and causes some of the philosophies that

99
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:22,239
the bank the bank has

100
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:25,200
we've run won a bunch of awards so we

101
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:28,239
have the most satisfied customers

102
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,040
and we're also the most authentic bank

103
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,480
in australia

104
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,200
as well and uh recently

105
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,840
um we've become australia's world best

106
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,920
bank

107
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,959
if that makes sense so the best on the

108
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,119
on the list of

109
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,480
uh world's best banks we we topped it

110
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,480
for australia

111
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,840
so all of this is kind of relevant to

112
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,238
what i'm talking about but kind of give

113
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,879
you

114
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,000
an idea on on where we're coming from as

115
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,239
well

116
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,319
so just a little disclaimer before we

117
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,879
get too far into the talk

118
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,399
uh so the views are mine and not

119
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,879
necessarily heritages

120
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:02,239
um although obviously some of those

121
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,079
overlap

122
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:05,760
and today i'll be talking about a few

123
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,280
things uh something that we've done

124
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,920
and some what we're doing from what we

125
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,840
might do and

126
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,720
some of those things i won't always be

127
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:17,280
clear on on which is which

128
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,639
and also you know the ideas here that

129
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,358
i'm talking about today

130
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:22,400
they're not all my ideas um i've got a

131
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,440
great team

132
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,198
and a great network of peers and you

133
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,759
know we bounce ideas around each other

134
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,440
and

135
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,120
use other people's ideas and build on

136
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,919
them so

137
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,280
i suggest you do the same um i think

138
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,960
there's probably some famous

139
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,400
person out there that said that you

140
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,680
surround yourself

141
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,080
by good people and if you can do that

142
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,280
then

143
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,120
it makes your life a lot easier and

144
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,638
obviously everyone should think about

145
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,960
their own environment

146
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,479
because what works for us might not work

147
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,400
for you

148
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,919
so make sure that whatever program you

149
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,120
put in places for purposes

150
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,000
now i just wanted to cover some

151
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,919
definitions at the start um

152
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,600
you know especially if you're new to the

153
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,280
field

154
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,880
some of these are often interchanged so

155
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,119
a vulnerability is a weakness that can

156
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,000
be exploited uh fire through adapter in

157
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,479
this system

158
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,600
um so i've stolen these off wikipedia so

159
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,199
if you want to look them up they're down

160
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,840
the bottom there

161
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,800
um but i just wanted to make a note uh

162
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,080
that

163
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,120
vulnerability vulnerabilities don't

164
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,800
always apply just to computer systems

165
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,240
they also apply to other types of

166
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,479
systems

167
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,490
people processes things like that as

168
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,758
well so keep that in mind

169
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,160
[Music]

170
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,639
vulnerability management is the practice

171
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,400
of identifying and classifying these

172
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,919
prioritizing them remediating and

173
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,239
mitigating

174
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,799
software vulnerabilities so it's a life

175
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,639
cycle of sorts

176
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,160
and vulnerability assessment is part of

177
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,039
that life cycle

178
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,440
where you're identifying and quantifying

179
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,880
and

180
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,840
ranking those vulnerabilities against

181
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,440
others

182
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,719
so that you know how you're going to

183
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,319
remediate and mitigate those

184
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,080
and patch management is also part of

185
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:11,440
that life cycle

186
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,159
and uh it's the part that is responsible

187
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,280
for the

188
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,759
um the remediation and mitigation of

189
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,400
those vulnerabilities as well

190
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,039
cvss is another term we'll talk about

191
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,880
and

192
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,560
it's basically a scoring system so that

193
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,319
you can take vulnerabilities

194
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,199
and kind of rank them against each other

195
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:32,880
to get some of that prioritization

196
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,000
there's plenty of i guess flaws within

197
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,880
that system

198
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,960
uh but that's probably uh out of the

199
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,680
scope of what we're talking about today

200
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,239
but we will touch a little bit on that

201
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,759
and

202
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,919
just to be clear for the purpose of this

203
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,400
talk i'll be talking

204
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,840
about vulnerabilities uh and when i say

205
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,239
that i mean restricted to software

206
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,080
vulnerabilities uh we won't be covering

207
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,080
you know process or people

208
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,800
vulnerabilities

209
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,919
so why do we care about vulnerability

210
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,479
management

211
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,000
so i know i've sat through a few talks

212
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,840
over the last couple of days

213
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,840
um that have touched on a few of these

214
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,919
things and underscored this

215
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,280
but the global landscape is definitely

216
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,560
something that influences

217
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,960
vulnerability and and why we care about

218
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,599
them

219
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,080
so more and more businesses are shifting

220
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:23,599
to a more digital approach

221
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,719
and code as well is really driving the

222
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,159
behavior

223
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,560
for more and more things to be happening

224
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,240
online and

225
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,319
we're also seeing an increased number of

226
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,680
vulnerabilities being disclosed

227
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,919
so um it means it's a much

228
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,000
uh different game than it has been

229
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,639
previously

230
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,400
there's also cyber crime that is kind of

231
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,120
playing into this as well

232
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,919
so a lot of the time cyber criminals

233
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,240
aren't

234
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,758
building zero days and exporting things

235
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,240
that you've never heard of

236
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,120
a lot of times it's stuff everyone knows

237
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,680
about

238
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,520
and just hasn't got to patching or

239
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,560
hasn't got a solid program

240
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,878
that's looking after this stuff the time

241
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:08,000
from pop or proof of concept to pop

242
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:10,000
so that's when you get um you know

243
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,919
the vulnerability is disclosed there's a

244
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,199
proof of concept out and we can see it

245
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,080
being exploited

246
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,759
um that's shrinking and you know it used

247
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,240
to be much larger you know we sort of

248
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,960
talking

249
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,720
weeks or months and now we're we're down

250
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,239
to hours and days

251
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:29,199
and there's also trends in ransomware

252
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:30,560
is becoming more profitable for

253
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,719
ransomware actors

254
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,240
they're making use of these

255
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,240
vulnerabilities that are

256
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,959
that people aren't patching to get into

257
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,120
network and deploy their ransomware

258
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,399
we're also seeing them stealing data and

259
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,440
things like that

260
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:49,279
um it's definitely driving

261
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:52,240
um i guess

262
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,680
motivating people to start taking this a

263
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,519
lot more seriously than perhaps they

264
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,040
would have before

265
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,880
because they can see that threat is

266
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,439
definitely growing

267
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,360
vulnerability management also has a

268
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,000
business impact

269
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,279
so if it's done well you'll actually get

270
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,279
decreased downtime

271
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:11,600
you'll decrease your cost and you'll

272
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,080
maintain that reputation and trust

273
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,160
so at the start i talked about how

274
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,000
heritage has this long history

275
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,680
uh we're winning awards for most

276
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,080
satisfied customers

277
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,359
um you know most authentic bank things

278
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,200
like that

279
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,640
we have a lot of reputation and trust

280
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,839
that we need to look after for our

281
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,519
members it's not

282
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,519
not just the money but that's a

283
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:32,959
definitely important thing as well

284
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,360
um but it's that trust that those

285
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:37,279
members have in our organization

286
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,959
that we want to maintain and there's a

287
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,959
big part and a core part

288
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,959
of our business velocity

289
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,080
so having a good vulnerability

290
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:51,120
management program to help

291
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,000
help manage that cyber exposure it's not

292
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,519
rocket science

293
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,200
but i'm not going to pretend it's easy

294
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,720
either so

295
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,200
there's a number of things that play

296
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,360
into it and i'm i'm sure

297
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,720
you've seen this before people process

298
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,320
and technology

299
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,000
and you have to have all of these things

300
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,720
working together

301
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:10,880
to be able to to have a successful

302
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,959
program

303
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,640
so in terms of people you have different

304
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,880
stakeholders that have

305
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,120
different inputs into that program and

306
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,480
are also looking at different things

307
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,079
you've got people like executive

308
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,360
management they're giving you priority

309
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,199
and budget if you don't have their

310
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,000
support it's going to be hard

311
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,600
to get people to come and help you to

312
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,120
get the tools to get the budget to do

313
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:34,240
the things

314
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,760
you also need vulnerability analysts who

315
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,120
are going to help with the vulnerability

316
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,720
assessment work out

317
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,640
which of these things is really bad and

318
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,160
we need to do something about right now

319
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,120
which of these things can we kind of

320
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,279
wait and look at down the track

321
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,560
you also need system engineers or a

322
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,399
patching team

323
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,479
and their roles are kind of kind of

324
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,720
varied one obviously is to

325
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,839
make sure that things get patched but

326
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,240
another is

327
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:00,000
to help the vulnerability analysts in

328
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,880
understanding some of the exploits and

329
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,839
some of the

330
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,760
vulnerabilities and provide that sme or

331
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,040
the subject matter expert advice

332
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:11,120
um to the analysts so together you'll

333
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,560
kind of work towards

334
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,680
a good outcome we also have business and

335
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,518
system owners

336
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,680
and oftentimes we forget about these

337
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,880
people and they are important to the

338
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,839
process

339
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,439
to these are the people that own the you

340
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,680
know the application that

341
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,959
sits on top of the servers or that

342
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,719
business function

343
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:34,800
or that tool and we really need them to

344
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,200
understand

345
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,040
you know the impact of some of their

346
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,519
decisions around

347
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:45,279
prioritization but also um

348
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,959
you know we need them to work with us to

349
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,120
get things like patching windows

350
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,560
um that are agreed so that we can know

351
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,680
we can patch uh

352
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:57,119
at certain times things like that

353
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,800
you need a process um so

354
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,320
it makes your life so much easier if the

355
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,920
process is documented

356
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,680
everybody knows where to find it and

357
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,040
they can they can reference it they can

358
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,880
look at it

359
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,360
you need some clearly defined targets

360
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,000
and reporting indicators

361
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,279
i i forget who said this to me um but it

362
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,079
was a long time ago

363
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:16,959
and they said that what gets measured

364
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,560
gets managed

365
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,920
so if you measure the wrong things

366
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,638
you're going to get managed the wrong

367
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,639
thing

368
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,240
so you really need to make sure that the

369
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:25,360
things that you're measuring are the

370
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,560
right things

371
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:31,200
and that is driving the behavior of the

372
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,800
of the process you need to make sure

373
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,399
like i said before your patch windows

374
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:37,040
your scan windows are

375
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,000
lined up so that you know if you have a

376
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,480
critical vulnerability

377
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,600
you have a window coming up sometimes

378
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,760
you might need to do it

379
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,360
outside of that but you know that month

380
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,200
and month out you have those windows to

381
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,279
get the stuff done

382
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,760
you also need to make sure that you have

383
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:55,680
appropriate test groups

384
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:57,920
because there's a really quick way to

385
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,719
make your business or system owner lose

386
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,519
faith

387
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,440
and that is to to push out a patch that

388
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,480
that takes the system offline

389
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:08,079
during a busy time for for their useful

390
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,800
for their customers

391
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:13,279
um then they're gonna you know become a

392
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,279
little less

393
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,839
excited about about the work that you're

394
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,279
doing next time you need to do something

395
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,959
in a hurry

396
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,800
you also need some good sources of

397
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,479
vulnerability information

398
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,000
and this can come from a number of

399
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,079
places um

400
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,079
but you need to kind of get a feel for

401
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,880
what's happening

402
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:35,199
in the wider environment you know are

403
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:38,639
these things being exported right now

404
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,959
um what what kind of

405
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,240
things need to be in place for this

406
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,079
exploit to happen

407
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:46,240
or this vulnerability to be taken

408
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,279
advantage of and then that helps you

409
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:50,480
feed in

410
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:53,760
and assess the risk of that

411
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:55,760
vulnerability in a more holistic way

412
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,439
you also need some technology so without

413
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,399
the technology this would be a very hard

414
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,240
process

415
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,440
so you need something that's going to do

416
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,079
your vulnerability scanning or your

417
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,000
vulnerability

418
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,160
assessment you need something that's

419
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,920
going to help you patch the things

420
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,160
and you also need some asset management

421
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,479
so that you know what things

422
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,199
need patching and what configuration

423
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,199
they should be at

424
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,279
so just talking about some of the

425
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,920
challenges we faced so like i said

426
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,720
um it's not rocket science but it's not

427
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,079
easy

428
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,680
and these are some of the things that we

429
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,560
have to try and work through and

430
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,160
overcome

431
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:30,160
um to improve our vulnerability

432
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,360
management program

433
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,800
so our patching targets were out of date

434
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:37,279
so this is talking about you know

435
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,040
what gets measured they hadn't moved to

436
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,000
the industry norms and they didn't align

437
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,040
to our

438
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
organization's risk appetite so they

439
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,959
definitely needed some

440
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
change the vulnerabilities when

441
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,560
considered in line

442
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,399
with our existing controls and other

443
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,599
information that we're getting about

444
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,760
vulnerabilities so we're just

445
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,440
at that point relying on the raw cbs

446
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,240
score so if it came out of the box out

447
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,760
of 10

448
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,079
that's what we said it was it was a 10

449
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:07,439
it's critical we need to do something

450
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:09,359
um without you know it might be a

451
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,240
vulnerability in ssh

452
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,199
and that's a server you know has a heap

453
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:16,130
of stuff in front of it

454
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:17,439
ips and firewalls et cetera et cetera

455
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,120
[Music]

456
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,920
maybe it's not critical it might just be

457
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,320
a high for example

458
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,319
we also had issues where new subnets

459
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,959
were being added

460
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,320
for new systems uh new parts and network

461
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,800
were being built out

462
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,639
and every time the network team created

463
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,319
a new subnet we had to go and manually

464
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:38,000
add that to our scanner

465
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,560
and we were finding that things were

466
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,279
getting missed so we had whole subnets

467
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,399
that we weren't

468
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,160
even looking at and

469
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,759
you know you stumble across one thing

470
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,040
you go hey wait a minute and then all of

471
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,519
a sudden you realize that

472
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,880
you know you've got these holes we have

473
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,480
multiple tools for both our

474
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,600
vulnerability scanning and our match

475
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,320
patch management so this sort of causes

476
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,759
some

477
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:03,120
some problems where um we couldn't build

478
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,040
a solid skill set

479
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,120
um we had multiple tools that were

480
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,399
telling us different things

481
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:10,480
we also had a lack of priority and

482
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,600
resourcing because we didn't have that

483
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,680
executive and business buy-in

484
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,519
um no common goal so the teams were

485
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,880
working on what they thought

486
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:24,320
was the best way to work and not all

487
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,320
aligned in the same direction

488
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:27,680
we also have business units that we're

489
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,479
concerned about downtime

490
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,920
and outages so let's talk a little bit

491
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,680
about those patch windows you know

492
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,880
that's one way that you can help address

493
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:36,959
those concerns

494
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,839
but also making sure that you're doing

495
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,758
appropriate testing as well

496
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,800
we had some legacy technology that

497
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,240
wasn't playing well with our

498
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,560
vulnerability scanner

499
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,519
and we also had some new technology that

500
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,839
wasn't playing well with our

501
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:53,920
vulnerability scanner

502
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:57,360
so you know we had to come up with some

503
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:59,839
solutions for that also

504
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,839
the the patching teams were taking the

505
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:04,880
results from the vulnerability scanner

506
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:05,919
and um you know kind of picking them

507
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:08,319
apart

508
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,959
and and pulling out the false positives

509
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,678
um

510
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,160
and kind of giving off the impression

511
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,559
that

512
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,439
um you know the vulnerability scanner

513
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:18,559
was inaccurate

514
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,679
and you know the the data we're giving

515
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:23,439
them wasn't

516
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:25,679
uh sufficient for them to to address the

517
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,000
the risk

518
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,240
we also have things like uh workstations

519
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,720
being turned off overnight you go home

520
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,480
you turn it off um so we did we were

521
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,120
doing the vulnerability scan

522
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,320
after hours to minimize the impact on

523
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,678
the network

524
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,918
but everybody was turning their things

525
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,360
off after hours so

526
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,960
you know we weren't always getting them

527
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,240
scanned and it was when

528
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,240
you know you'd have people that might

529
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,760
leave their workstation on by mistake

530
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,840
you would suddenly get a vulnerability

531
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,840
scan and light up like a christmas tree

532
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,360
we also had um

533
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,039
a bit of a issue where we're struggling

534
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,080
to manage um

535
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:06,799
exemptions or risk acceptance um

536
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:08,559
and reflecting that in our in our

537
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,160
reporting of our vulnerability

538
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,639
uh management program and things like

539
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,120
that which um we're taking a lot of time

540
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,640
and

541
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:18,000
we're trying to find a way to streamline

542
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:20,720
that and make our lives a bit easier

543
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:23,520
and so there's a good chunk of stuff

544
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,840
there that we needed to fix

545
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:30,160
and this is kind of how we approached it

546
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,959
so uh visibility uh if if you don't know

547
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,200
what's out there

548
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,160
then it's very hard to manage it so we

549
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,559
did a few things

550
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:38,960
um we expanded our scan ranges so

551
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:40,960
instead of having them added manually

552
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,039
we just put these great big scan ranges

553
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,960
in

554
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,879
which we're kind of reluctant to do it

555
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,600
first because

556
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,080
the way that we were scanning meant that

557
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,678
the scan was running for a long time

558
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,000
so we changed that and we ended up

559
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:58,400
building discovery scans

560
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,520
so there's basically you do a ping scan

561
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,200
you find the things

562
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,960
that are up and then that then builds

563
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,240
into another list of when you go off and

564
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,039
you do your more

565
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,039
in-depth credentialed scan as you go

566
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:12,320
through

567
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:14,640
um credentialed and agent scanning so

568
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:16,559
a lot of the time when people are saying

569
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,640
that the scanning was inaccurate we

570
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,160
were looking at it and discovering that

571
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,160
we weren't actually doing a credentialed

572
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,240
scan of that device

573
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,760
and that some of the vulnerabilities

574
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,880
that was finding was kind of like a best

575
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:29,520
guess

576
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,200
type approach so by improving and

577
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,600
increasing the number of devices that we

578
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,039
had

579
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,678
credentialed scans for um we certainly

580
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,960
reduced those false positives because

581
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:41,679
the scanner was able to

582
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,520
to get much more insight into what was

583
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:46,960
running on that host

584
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:50,160
and for our user endpoints we deployed

585
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:52,480
agents so what that meant is that

586
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,840
instead of um all that scanning getting

587
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,760
done over the network

588
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,199
uh it was getting done just locally on

589
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,879
the endpoint

590
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,240
and then all that was coming back was

591
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,240
basically the results

592
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:06,159
um this is just you know text um

593
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:07,760
and that means that you know the

594
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,200
overnight scanning problems

595
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,280
went away because we were able to do it

596
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,559
during the day um

597
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:15,120
and and we're getting much better

598
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:17,440
results there

599
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,479
we also expanded the skype over external

600
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,320
and

601
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:22,240
introduced our web app scanning so we

602
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,480
have a much better idea now

603
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:26,880
on what is on our perimeter um which is

604
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,760
really important

605
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:31,679
we tried to simplify where we could and

606
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,080
this is sometimes

607
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,360
easier said than done but if you can

608
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,799
reduce complexity

609
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,320
uh it just makes it easier it's fairly

610
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:42,400
obvious i think

611
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,639
so we consolidated our scanning tool set

612
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:46,960
and we chose tenable

613
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,760
it meant that we had consolidated

614
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,960
reporting

615
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:52,879
it meant um we had most skills around

616
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,559
tenable in terms of our vulnerability

617
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,720
management platform

618
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,080
and so we were able to consolidate on

619
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,760
that um

620
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,480
and and just build our skills out on

621
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:05,039
that one on on that one tool set

622
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,600
and we also have a licensing benefit

623
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,240
because

624
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:10,480
you know through economies of scale and

625
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,640
things like that we actually save money

626
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,200
through consolidating our outsourcing

627
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,200
understandable

628
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,880
um we also consolidated some of our

629
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:22,240
patching um so

630
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,760
we had different things for um i think

631
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,120
we have five or six different patching

632
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,799
tools at one point

633
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,799
um so we reduced that as much as we can

634
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,559
it meant that linux and windows server

635
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,679
infrastructure could get patched on the

636
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,399
same tool

637
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:38,400
which meant that we're able to take some

638
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,000
skills that the windows team had

639
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,440
and transfer them across so that they

640
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:44,960
are able to start patching

641
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:48,240
some of the linux as well which meant

642
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:50,159
um more people were able to do that

643
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,480
and were able to turn around that stuff

644
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,799
a little bit quicker

645
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:56,799
we also went through we reviewed our

646
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,320
scans that we had set up our reports the

647
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:01,440
asset groups dashboards

648
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,200
all that kind of thing we removed the

649
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,880
whole heap of stuff

650
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,520
and we also tightened up the permissions

651
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:10,799
as well what we're finding is that

652
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,480
whilst we had our scans going the other

653
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,080
teams that were given access to

654
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,919
were setting up their own scans and

655
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:19,280
reports and it was just

656
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,960
kind of counterintuitive because um yeah

657
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,480
but they're saying oh this this thing's

658
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,799
showing me this and that

659
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,320
and you know it's like well what are you

660
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,760
looking at that's not what i'm seeing

661
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,559
over here

662
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,960
um so that that really helped us out to

663
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,520
simplify that approach

664
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,960
we also came up with a clear plan uh so

665
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,240
that everybody knew what we were

666
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:42,240
executing against

667
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,760
and um i think that's really important

668
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,200
that everyone's on the same page

669
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:49,440
top to bottom executives write down um

670
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:51,440
we all know where we're going uh given

671
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,559
the level of detail might change between

672
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,400
those levels

673
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,399
um it all kind of rolls up into one

674
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:01,360
so that kind of comes to focus and it's

675
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:03,679
giving us that focus so everyone's going

676
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:05,760
in the same direction

677
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:07,360
we ended up we're able to get new

678
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,520
targets agreed to

679
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,199
and we had support from executives and

680
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,799
senior management for that

681
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,880
we now have our targets aligned to

682
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,918
industry norms it matches our risk

683
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,200
appetite

684
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,640
um so you know everybody

685
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,559
is all tightened up and we know where

686
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,280
we're going

687
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,760
we set up a vulnerability response team

688
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,600
so

689
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:29,520
this is a cross-functional team that

690
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,799
manages and responds to vulnerabilities

691
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,720
so

692
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,400
anything critical we talk about and we

693
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,320
get patched right away

694
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,400
and then we also look at ways that we

695
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,639
can um

696
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,559
you know make improvements to the to the

697
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,919
vulnerability management process

698
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:47,120
but also um make sure that uh nothing

699
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,760
gets missed along the way

700
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,360
so if the current patching cycles don't

701
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,120
pick something up we'll pick it up

702
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,799
and then address that through through

703
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,439
that forum

704
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,080
and like i said cross-functional so

705
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,520
we've got

706
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,600
you know developers infrastructure

707
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:04,720
network security guys

708
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,240
um you know all working towards the same

709
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,640
goal

710
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,120
we started um using a more risk-based

711
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,480
lens in assessing vulnerabilities

712
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,120
so one of the goals that i wanted is

713
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,799
that

714
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,719
if i went to one of the patching teams

715
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,799
and said this is critical

716
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,440
it really was critical and it's like we

717
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:26,158
need to patch this we're in trouble

718
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,840
and the number of vulnerabilities that

719
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,780
were critical

720
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,520
based just off cbss

721
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,918
[Music]

722
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,639
you know weren't really um what i

723
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,559
thought

724
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,919
packing into account our internal

725
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,039
infrastructure and the controls that we

726
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,520
had in place

727
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,080
but also we'd find some that you know

728
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,879
maybe

729
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,678
a high or medium in cvss and you look at

730
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,520
that and you go

731
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:50,720
you know we need to bump that up and do

732
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:52,639
something about that much sooner

733
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,400
um part of that was considering you know

734
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,240
is it under active exploit how long has

735
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,320
it been around for

736
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,480
are there tool sets which help deploy

737
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,158
this easily

738
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,320
turnable has a vpr score that we've

739
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:05,520
started to use that takes into account

740
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,720
some of these things

741
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:10,000
but we also um do our own i guess you

742
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,880
call it like threat research or

743
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,880
something

744
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:17,039
and we take in um from external sources

745
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,360
for a daily threat briefing around

746
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:20,960
what we're seeing in the outside world

747
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,559
and if anything pops up there

748
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:26,240
um to make sure that we're on to it

749
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,480
we also developed some tools so one of

750
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,600
those was to use an api to manage those

751
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,360
exemptions

752
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,799
so instead of an analyst sitting down

753
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,678
and clicking and clicking and clicking

754
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,760
and clicking

755
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,080
we're able to programmatically execute

756
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,840
that in a much shorter period of time

757
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,639
which strengthen the amount of time it

758
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,439
took to

759
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,880
manage those risk acceptances month on

760
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,520
month

761
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,320
and uh it was a really good example of

762
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,000
how we

763
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,439
we worked with the development team to

764
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,640
help us build that

765
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,039
so that we could get it done in a much

766
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:59,600
shorter period of time and

767
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,879
um yeah that was a really good outcome

768
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,199
for us

769
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,960
we've also started logging um data from

770
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,320
tenable into swap

771
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:11,600
so we built an app to help

772
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:15,200
recast and assess those risks

773
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,000
into swank which um that saved us a heap

774
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,919
of time as well

775
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,080
and it kind of took it from this massive

776
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,880
task that we had no idea on how we're

777
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,840
going to do

778
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,400
to something that we can just do day and

779
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,480
day out

780
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,480
as the vulnerabilities pop up we can go

781
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,679
through and we can run them through this

782
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,480
tool

783
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:33,760
and put our you know kind of local

784
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,200
knowledge across it

785
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:40,240
and um you know we can get those risks

786
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,720
the cvs scores going up and down based

787
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,000
on

788
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,200
on how our environment looks we've also

789
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,120
used it to build out some other

790
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,490
interesting alerts

791
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,360
and searches for things

792
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:52,720
[Music]

793
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,120
yeah there's some good stuff that we've

794
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:58,320
done there uh some of the things

795
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:01,279
i'm just trying to think um you know

796
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,799
looking for software that um you might

797
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,520
not know is in your network and things

798
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,840
like that

799
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:10,080
and yeah it's just one example

800
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,879
uh we also spent a bit of time working

801
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,960
on business and system owner engagement

802
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,559
so making sure that we get agreed patch

803
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,760
windows and outages

804
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:20,000
so our service delivery team has done a

805
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,520
great

806
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,520
job here so it's not only windows for

807
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,799
for patching but also for you know

808
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,720
system upgrades and things like that

809
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,799
where they need to do

810
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,720
maintenance outside of volatility

811
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:34,158
management

812
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,000
we're seeing that business is starting

813
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,960
to own the vulnerability risk so it's

814
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,720
not just

815
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:41,279
the security guys that are saying you

816
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,760
know hey we need to patch this stuff

817
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,039
um you know they're taking an interest

818
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,760
they're starting to own that risk and

819
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:50,720
drive those outcomes

820
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:51,440
we've also worked to get vulnerability

821
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:55,600
management

822
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:59,679
considerate considerations into

823
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:03,600
the deployment of new uh systems and

824
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:06,799
servers and networks so

825
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,480
we're having issues where um

826
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,520
you know you have an application that

827
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:14,000
was built on a version of java

828
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:16,799
but then you have to run that version of

829
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:19,679
java for the rest of your life

830
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,440
because that application needs to work

831
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:23,840
so we spent a lot of time

832
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,360
looking at things like that and you know

833
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,879
how can we avoid getting ourselves in

834
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:27,678
this position where we're tied to this

835
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,200
vulnerable

836
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:32,880
version of code and happily we've

837
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:34,320
we've managed to work through that list

838
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,640
of of things

839
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,879
and and find solutions for each of those

840
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,279
applications so that

841
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,559
we can update those components we're

842
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,520
also looking at

843
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:47,120
um you know if this thing is really

844
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,840
important we need to make sure that

845
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,520
we are able to patch it and if it needs

846
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,959
to be something that needs to be tested

847
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,799
how do we do that

848
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,960
um how do we make sure that we can test

849
00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:00,080
it before it goes back into production

850
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:04,000
looking at things like aha

851
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:07,039
or high availability and not just from

852
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:08,559
like a dr bcp perspective but

853
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:10,480
you know it's really great if we could

854
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,600
do it so that we can patch things here

855
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:13,440
in the middle of the day

856
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,799
because it means that then our system

857
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:17,039
engineers and

858
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,158
desktop engineers aren't having to stay

859
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:21,440
up all night

860
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:24,000
to do patching

861
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,679
they can just you know schedule that

862
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,960
automation to go off and do that in the

863
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,640
middle of the day

864
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,159
and we've got hands on deck that if

865
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,120
there is any problems we can quickly

866
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,120
address it and fix it

867
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,840
ownership is another one so making sure

868
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,159
that everybody knows what their

869
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,600
responsibilities are

870
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,279
what they should be doing when they

871
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,879
should be doing it and

872
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,279
reviewing their output on a regular

873
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,679
basis

874
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:50,720
so after all of that did we get some

875
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:54,159
results well

876
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:57,039
yes they improved which was um

877
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:59,039
you know the main outcome uh we got

878
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,520
efficiency gains within the security

879
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,559
team

880
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:05,679
so by building those apps um

881
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:08,799
to use the apis and then splunk

882
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,600
we're able to shorten that vulnerability

883
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:14,080
assessment

884
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,760
process just by heaps

885
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,480
we also have this cross-functional team

886
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,320
now so the vulnerability response team

887
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,760
that's actively working on improving

888
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:24,559
vulnerability management

889
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:26,399
working together and we're seeing where

890
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,080
peers are helping each other

891
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,840
across different teams to solve problems

892
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,158
that they see coming up

893
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:35,199
so you know our passion teams aren't

894
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:36,640
siloed in their specialities anymore

895
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,919
and if if they're getting any issues

896
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,720
they can bring them to the table and

897
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,760
discuss

898
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,440
and we can find a way forward as a group

899
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,520
we also have executive and management

900
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,799
support um so

901
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,279
you know that's really important when

902
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:51,279
you're you know trying to get time from

903
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,640
from developers and infrastructure

904
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,440
engineers that are on projects and

905
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,200
things like that to help out

906
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,200
we've reduced our licensing cost like i

907
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,000
said before which is always good if you

908
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,640
can say

909
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,240
that you know here's some firm evidence

910
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,960
that we've managed to

911
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,159
reduce some money and we also have

912
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,799
improved accuracy

913
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:12,720
so through increasing our credentialed

914
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:15,679
scans having those agents

915
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,440
on the endpoint it means that we've

916
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:21,120
increased our accuracy so we're getting

917
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:22,960
less um you know false positive

918
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,080
complaints um now there's always going

919
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,519
to be some it's never going to be

920
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:28,559
perfect it's just

921
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:30,880
the way the world is and we've also

922
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:33,519
increased our visibility as well

923
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,440
so um much more confident that we're

924
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:38,240
seeing the things that we need to see

925
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,360
and then we're not missing anything our

926
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,480
new systems are being

927
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,559
better deployed so that we're

928
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,519
able to manage vulnerabilities a lot

929
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,440
easier

930
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:50,080
because of the way that we're deploying

931
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,080
the systems

932
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:55,120
we've also done things like use tenable

933
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:57,840
to search for iocs

934
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:59,600
so because it's just running across our

935
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,279
endpoints

936
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,799
you know you can load up audit files and

937
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:04,720
queries and

938
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,240
you can look for certain strings and

939
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,919
things like that um

940
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:10,320
quite easily and you can use that data

941
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,279
and splunk to search retrospectively as

942
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,639
well

943
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:17,440
if you're looking for indicators

944
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:19,039
so what's next um well like i said we're

945
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,640
always looking at ways to improve

946
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:26,799
um so we're working on dependencies

947
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:28,799
so dependencies are a bit harder than

948
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,158
just normal vulnerabilities i suppose uh

949
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:34,080
in a sense

950
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:35,760
and um you know more and more parts of

951
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:40,080
our business is starting to use

952
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:42,480
um you know automation and um

953
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,360
data science and things like that to try

954
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,279
and improve

955
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,719
efficiency and outcomes for their

956
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:50,480
specific use case

957
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:54,080
um so trying to keep a handle on that

958
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:56,399
um we're looking at scanning containers

959
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,158
so that we're pulling out um

960
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,760
the dependencies within that container

961
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:02,240
and making sure that they're

962
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,679
nice and solid and trying to do that

963
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,240
within the pipeline

964
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,159
um our current pipeline the security

965
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,919
test run along we've got security gates

966
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:12,240
there

967
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:13,679
so the devs are fixing it before it gets

968
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,720
to a point where it's even close to

969
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,600
production

970
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,600
which is really good

971
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,760
we're also you know integration into

972
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:24,639
current reporting

973
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:26,720
so i'm quite keen around that because

974
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,480
when we had those disparate systems

975
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,679
that weren't talking to each other we

976
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,960
used to spend a lot of time from a

977
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,200
little bit of data here a little bit of

978
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,880
data there and trying to put it together

979
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,559
so we really need that integration so

980
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:39,760
that we've got that single pane that

981
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:42,399
everybody's looking at

982
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,799
so we're looking at saw as a way to help

983
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:46,639
manage vulnerabilities as well

984
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,720
so we already have integration from

985
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,760
tenable to our soil platform or vice

986
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,919
versa

987
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,080
and we're using that during incident

988
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,279
response so we can get

989
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,840
up-to-date information of what

990
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:02,080
vulnerabilities that are on that system

991
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:04,399
um you know the kind of patch status

992
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,600
and we can perform ad hoc scans and

993
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:08,239
things like that

994
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,679
which is enriching the data that we have

995
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:12,799
already for the analysts

996
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:15,119
um which is really great

997
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,639
and we're looking at how we can build as

998
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,960
much of our vulnerability management

999
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:22,159
process into us or platform

1000
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,240
so whether some of the manual stuff that

1001
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,280
we're still doing we can automate into

1002
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:30,638
into our um automation platform

1003
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,040
to you know make it even easier and it

1004
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,079
just

1005
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,029
kind of happens um you know

1006
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:37,359
using our asset data to

1007
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:39,040
[Music]

1008
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,719
do some of that assessment automatically

1009
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,000
so that um

1010
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:43,678
trying to get some of that inherent

1011
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,600
knowledge out of our brains and into a

1012
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,839
tool

1013
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,719
[Music]

1014
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:50,078
to help flesh out and and really

1015
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:52,239
highlight anything that really is

1016
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:55,040
critical

1017
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:55,759
and also um you know automate the ticket

1018
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,560
creation

1019
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,079
for the batching teams so we can kind of

1020
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:03,680
set some parameters

1021
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:06,640
um we can go often and automate

1022
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,160
you know activities that that uh we're

1023
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,680
doing manually at the moment and then

1024
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,640
have that automatically push through

1025
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,839
into the

1026
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:16,879
cues for the patching teams

1027
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:20,400
uh we've also got um improving

1028
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,240
our audit files and baseline scans so

1029
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,520
you know this is around compliance

1030
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,040
scanning so

1031
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,280
if you're building stuff solid at the

1032
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,599
start it's much easier to manage as you

1033
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,320
go

1034
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:32,160
because there's not so many places that

1035
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,240
vulnerabilities can creep in if you

1036
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,118
start with that solar face

1037
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:38,479
and um you know we're writing plugins

1038
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:40,079
and audit files

1039
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:42,839
um to go looking for things that are

1040
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,000
specific to our environment that we care

1041
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:46,720
about

1042
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,760
which kind of covers that point and also

1043
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,759
we're looking at ways that we can

1044
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:54,720
improve our reporting

1045
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:57,200
so reducing i guess

1046
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,879
the different types of reporting and

1047
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,200
making sure that it all aligns

1048
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,680
and that you know whilst you need the

1049
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,520
detail this host this one will be

1050
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,799
here's how you remediate it for our

1051
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:10,079
patching teams

1052
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,960
um you need that alt roll up with the

1053
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:14,880
same lens

1054
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,640
for our executive teams um

1055
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:18,079
and then you know that just helps in the

1056
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,440
management of things

1057
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:23,040
um you know what gets measured gets

1058
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:24,400
managed so if you're measuring the right

1059
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,320
things and it's all rolling up then

1060
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:29,280
that's what is going to get managed too

1061
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:31,280
so that's really important um so i've

1062
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,240
made this kind of ugly

1063
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,680
process diagram here so sorry about the

1064
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,319
um

1065
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:41,759
the patchiness i suppose um but i

1066
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:44,800
thought it might be useful to put out

1067
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,680
in sort of a picture form uh how we look

1068
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,880
at our

1069
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,919
our process so internally we have our

1070
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,520
discovery scan

1071
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,200
which then feeds the list of discovered

1072
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,119
assets which we do the credentials

1073
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,960
scans against and we have that same

1074
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:00,720
process externally as well

1075
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:03,040
this makes the scan times much faster

1076
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:05,118
which means that you know we can scan

1077
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,240
more often

1078
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:08,880
which is which is really good we also

1079
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,240
have

1080
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,359
agent scanning web app scanning

1081
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:15,040
container scanning you know ad-hoc scans

1082
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:18,319
and our audit compliance scan so they

1083
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,240
all feed all of these scans feed into

1084
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,320
an assessment and enrichment process i

1085
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:24,959
suppose you call it

1086
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,800
so we've used a number of tool sets

1087
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,760
there sustainable splunk

1088
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:31,440
our threat intel patching teams security

1089
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,040
automation

1090
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,359
you know outputs around our accepted

1091
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,040
risks and things like that

1092
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:39,839
and that will get smudged together and

1093
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,680
then start spitting out into reports

1094
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,279
and then reports of you know board risk

1095
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:47,359
committee security committee

1096
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:49,359
patching teams um and off we go

1097
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:51,680
so you know we just kind of loop around

1098
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:54,880
that process

1099
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:57,279
so just some final thoughts um

1100
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:58,160
you know how can you be a hero so build

1101
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,920
the process

1102
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:01,920
um so if you've got a solid process that

1103
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,880
everyone can follow make it as simple as

1104
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,440
possible

1105
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,960
have some clear goals so make sure that

1106
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:08,480
they're appropriate

1107
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,640
you've got your stakeholders engaged

1108
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,839
across all levels they know

1109
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,040
why they're doing things how they're

1110
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,078
doing things and when they're doing

1111
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,759
things

1112
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,800
make sure that you've got discipline and

1113
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,000
accountability so discipline

1114
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,839
discipline's a big one

1115
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,680
doing the same things over and over and

1116
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:24,320
over again

1117
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,799
repeatable actions and hold yourself to

1118
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:28,079
account

1119
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:30,240
as well as the stakeholders and most

1120
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,200
importantly is the communication piece

1121
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,879
that wraps all of this together um and

1122
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,680
kind of greases the wheels and makes it

1123
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,680
all work

1124
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:41,200
um so yeah

1125
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,118
um so it brings us to the end so if

1126
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,240
anyone's got questions um if they want

1127
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,680
to pop them in the

1128
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:51,200
q a i'll um pop that screen up

1129
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:53,359
and uh i can answer that

1130
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,439
bingo the hardware the hardware mute

1131
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:57,680
button now does me in every time

1132
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,640
um sorry so we're basically out of time

1133
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:01,118
but there's um

1134
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:02,640
four questions in the q a if you wanted

1135
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:04,800
to try and very quick very quickly

1136
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:08,078
address those

1137
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,800
yeah no worries um so patch management

1138
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,720
deployment

1139
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,520
tool um so we still have a couple that

1140
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,078
we're using

1141
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,440
but we have shrunk it down so we're

1142
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,960
using bigfix

1143
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:24,000
and um sorry that whoever makes this but

1144
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:27,280
shadlock whatever they're called now

1145
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,000
i keep forgetting their new name so

1146
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:30,960
big fix we're using uh for our uh

1147
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,160
endpoints

1148
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:37,200
uh our user devices and then

1149
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:38,720
the new shaflic um i'm not on the team

1150
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,240
that that has to play with it every day

1151
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,980
so you can tell that after gone they're

1152
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:43,680
one of the ones that was consumed

1153
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:47,040
[Music]

1154
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:50,160
yeah there you go that's it um

1155
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,240
so yeah they're our main ones um

1156
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,359
how big is my team and do i have any

1157
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:56,720
difficulty

1158
00:39:53,359 --> 00:40:00,000
attracting qualified people um so

1159
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:04,000
currently uh i got six on my team

1160
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:07,520
um so we're not really huge

1161
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:10,079
and and it keeps us pretty busy but

1162
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,680
using things like um you know like some

1163
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,720
of the automation and things like that

1164
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:17,759
um is we were really looking to

1165
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,598
um kind of leverage um what we're doing

1166
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:22,839
there as well

1167
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:24,160
in terms of attracting qualified people

1168
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:27,200
um

1169
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:30,879
well yeah um you know

1170
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:33,759
we we are always out of the big cities

1171
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:35,040
um not too far it's only an hour hour

1172
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:38,400
and a half to brisbane

1173
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,839
um but uh

1174
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,760
you know i think covert is going to

1175
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:44,480
shape shake that up a lot

1176
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,960
um i have been asked a number of times

1177
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,119
whether

1178
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,240
we consider hiring in brisbane or other

1179
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:51,359
places

1180
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:53,040
and at that time i just hadn't the

1181
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:54,640
time to put my brain around how to

1182
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,960
manage a remote team

1183
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:58,000
and how it would look like for the sock

1184
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,599
but hey

1185
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:03,119
we've done that now um so you know

1186
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,560
it's going to make life a bit easier for

1187
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,400
us but up until now um

1188
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,799
we've kind of taken the approach where

1189
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:14,079
we looked for um

1190
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:17,119
potential and we take that potential

1191
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:19,440
and we try and foster that and

1192
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:20,480
we've had i think a lot of success with

1193
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,760
that um

1194
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:24,240
looking for the attention on a good fit

1195
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:25,839
for team um and then building those

1196
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,399
skills

1197
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,960
um so mark got a question there around

1198
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,160
uh

1199
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,079
tennable i o um so um

1200
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,200
we are using tunable i o but we're also

1201
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:38,400
using um

1202
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:41,520
printable security center as well um

1203
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,640
and the the necessary so they were kind

1204
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,560
of tied together

1205
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:48,400
and you know different parts of it for

1206
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:51,440
different use cases

1207
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:54,480
so turnable io definitely be using

1208
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,960
across the perimeter we're a security

1209
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:59,520
center

1210
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:01,119
and we're running internally more to

1211
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,480
give those bigger insights into the

1212
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,839
intent on that one you're gonna have to

1213
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,960
stop it there jp if you want to try and

1214
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,319
answer the rest of those questions in

1215
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,280
the general chat i'm sure everybody

1216
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,560

1217
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:10,000
thank you really interesting to actually

1218

1219
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,800
banking environment

1220
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,200
and to see how things are actually

1221
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,960

1222
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,240
more uh willing to hire remote people

1223
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:22,480
