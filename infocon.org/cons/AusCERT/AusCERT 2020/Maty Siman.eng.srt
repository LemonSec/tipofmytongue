00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,119
take it away

32
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,159
everyone and thank you for joining me

33
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,000
today

34
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,760
for those of you who attended last

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,960
year's presentation

36
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,439
it was titled as software is everywhere

37
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:19,759
we have demonstrated how hackers can

38
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,960
hack into autonomous cars

39
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:25,600
exfiltrate data with smart light bulbs

40
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,360
and we even even showed how we can turn

41
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,960
every alexa device

42
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,200
into an eavesdropping device this year i

43
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,320
want to make an even bolder statement

44
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,280
i want to say that ai software is

45
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,520
everywhere

46
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,960
artificial intelligence

47
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,720
there are dozens of small startups

48
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,798
that try to disrupt their respective

49
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,320
market using ai

50
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,759
with healthcare industry you can see

51
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,639
that there are companies that build

52
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,000
chatbots

53
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,320
wearable devices drug discovery they all

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,920
use

55
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:03,600
ai to improve the healthcare industry

56
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:06,960
the same goes with the fintech industry

57
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,038
and the e-commerce but it is not limited

58
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,519
only to these smaller

59
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:13,839
players in the market small startups

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,319
even the largest companies in the world

61
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,200
like ibm google yahoo microsoft and

62
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,238
facebook

63
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,399
they all use ai to improve their service

64
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:25,599
they're providing

65
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,760
when we upload a picture when we upload

66
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:31,119
an image or a photo to facebook

67
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,599
it uses ai for face tagging whenever we

68
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,000
call

69
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,799
for an uber the estimated time of

70
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,239
arrival

71
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,640
is based on ai when we go to amazon and

72
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,800
we

73
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,799
look into things that we want to

74
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,400
purchase the recommendation is also

75
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,480
based on ai

76
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,840
but i think that one of the companies

77
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,720
really topped them all

78
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,200
and i want to focus on google google

79
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,200
wants

80
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,480
all the information in the world to be

81
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,799
searchable that's their business

82
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,640
one of the problem they're facing is the

83
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,760
fact that there is a lot of data and

84
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,399
information in the world

85
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,359
that is not stored in the web it is

86
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,640
stored only

87
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,120
in humans minds and this information is

88
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:14,399
not searchable by google

89
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,840
so the first step for them to a to be

90
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,040
able to make that information

91
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,680
researchable

92
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,440
is by asking and interviewing people

93
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,280
about their knowledge

94
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,959
talking with these people and then

95
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,840
storing that information in their

96
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:28,560
servers

97
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,879
so the first step is to build a bot that

98
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,280
is

99
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,159
capable of having a human-like

100
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,799
conversation

101
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:37,200
over the phone with people and by having

102
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,560
that people will share that information

103
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,159
with google just as an example

104
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,080
the other day i was looking for the

105
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,399
opening hours in one of the stores

106
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,040
under my apartment and i couldn't find

107
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,080
it because that store doesn't have

108
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:54,640
a website google wants to build a bot

109
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,760
that is capable of calling that store

110
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,480
and asking them about that their opening

111
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,480
hours

112
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,319
so the first step is to build a boat

113
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,760
that is capable of handling a human-like

114
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,839
conversation

115
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,239
over the phone let's see where they

116
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,239
stained

117
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,760
what's happening hi i'm calling the book

118
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,039

119
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:20,029

120
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:23,299
sure give me one second

121
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:23,299
[Music]

122
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,720
sure what time are you looking for

123
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,000

124
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,720
at 12 p.m we do not have a 12 p.m

125
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,960
available

126
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,040
the closest we have to that is a 1 15.

127
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,120
do you have anything between 10 a.m and

128
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,440
uh 12 p.m

129
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:44,240
depending on what service she would like

130
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,719
what service is she looking for

131
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,800
just a woman's haircut for now okay we

132

138
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:10,719
[Applause]

139
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,919
bye okay

140
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:17,440
so far we've seen how a computer can

141
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,520
mimic a human's behavior but now

142
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,960
let's play a game i want to show how a

143
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,479
computer can

144
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,880
play a game better than any human being

145
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,240
for that purpose i've chosen the to show

146
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,000
you the flappy birds

147
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,479
game for those of you who are not

148
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,400
familiar in this game the birds need to

149
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,960
flap it wings in order to pass with the

150
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,280
different

151
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,400
tree branches without hitting any of

152
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,719
these branches

153
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,479
and it really depends whether the bird

154
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,240
is close enough or too far

155
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,800
too high or too low and so on and so

156
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,960
forth now in order to teach

157
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,479
the the computer how to win this game

158
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,560
there are two approaches

159
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,400
the classic approach would be for me as

160
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,720
a human being to understand

161
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,280
the winning strategy and then to feed

162
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,919
that strategy as an algorithm

163
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,919
in case you're very close uh don't flap

164
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:06,240
your wing if you're high don't flap it

165
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,960
but if you're really at the right

166
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,840
right height then flat the wings and the

167
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,880
other approach

168
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,599
would be to let the computer learn

169
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,639
on its own how to play this game just to

170
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,120
play

171
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,680
many many games until it automatically

172
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,639
learns

173
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,319
the winning strategy for this

174
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,440
demonstration we've chosen

175
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,600
the genetic algorithm to to win this

176
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,400
game with genetic algorithm we're going

177
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,759
to

178
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,919
create a generation of 10 birds

179
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,120
that just flap their wings completely

180
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,840
randomly

181
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,479
some of them by pure luck will play

182
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,840
better than

183
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:46,318
others we take the birds that

184
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,198
that fly better than others we breed

185
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,120
them together

186
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,199
we create another generation of ten

187
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,319
birds as offsprings of these winning

188
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,800
birds

189
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,039
we slightly mutate each of these birds

190
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,960
just to give it a chance to play better

191
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,120
than its parents and we play another

192
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,318
generation and then we take the best

193
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,240
birds

194
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,160
we breed them together and another

195
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,080
generation and another generation and

196
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,479
another generation

197
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,318
hopefully at the end we'll reach to a

198
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,479
bird that plays this game

199
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,160
very very well and we didn't have to

200
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,199
teach it how to play

201
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:22,479
just by the fact that it wins

202
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,720
it becomes a better bird so

203
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,318
the motivation is to teach the birds how

204
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,720
to flop optimally

205
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,479
in order to fly safely without prayer

206
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,759
knowledge of winning strategy

207
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:36,080
using genetic algorithm first we create

208
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,560
initial population randomly

209
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:40,560
and then as the game is being played we

210
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:43,120
employ natural evolution

211
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,720
we select the best samples we cross over

212
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:47,280
and mutate

213
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,160
now a key concept here is the target

214
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,239
function

215
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,520
we want to maximize the value if we

216
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,080
compare two birds

217
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,840
we want to maximize something that

218
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,479
something in this case would be the

219
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,119
distance

220
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:01,520
traveled by each bird so we want to

221
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,000
improve or to maximize that value

222
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,599
we take two birds and the one that

223
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,360
reverse the most distance

224
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:12,240
is the better bird for our needs

225
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,840
so let's let's see how it goes live so

226
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,840
we start with the first generation

227
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,120
second generation

228
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:27,840
[Music]

229
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
fourth

230
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:37,679
[Music]

231
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:51,440
fifth

232
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:51,439
[Music]

233
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,120
and we have reached by the 73rd

234
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,440
generation

235
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,800
a winning bird which is practically

236
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,720
invincible

237
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,160
you can see that the red arrow points to

238
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,839
the distance traveled by that bird

239
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,319
138 units

240
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,399
which is by far the best bird and again

241
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:14,800
i didn't have to teach it anything

242
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,680
and even if the rules of the games would

243
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,920
have been different

244
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,839
the trees are moving or some of them are

245
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,000
narrow or so on and so forth

246
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,760
it doesn't really matter the bird will

247
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,040
learn how to win this

248
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,000
this game but this is a security

249
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,640
conference

250
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,120
so let's wear our black hat for a moment

251
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,839
let's play the very same game but

252
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:42,080
instead of birds

253
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,560
we will have worms and viruses

254
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,920
instead of three branches we will have

255
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,119
antiviruses

256
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,959
detection mechanisms and the

257
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,160
uh target function that we want to

258
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,800
maximize

259
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,680
is the to get the maximum number of

260
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,599
antiviruses

261
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,279
that our virus can go through without

262
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,440
being detected

263
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,519
so we will start with the virus and then

264
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,240
we will mutate it and mutated it

265
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,519
so and so forth until we reach to a

266
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,640
point where

267
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,600
no none of the available antiverses is

268
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,600
able to detect it

269
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,719
so we will start with the virus or with

270
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,319
the worm

271
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,880
that gets detected by 42 antiviruses

272
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,120
okay that's the start we will create

273
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,800
another generation where each of

274
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,200
the worms is slightly mutated

275
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,000
and then we see that the yellow and blue

276
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,079
ones are

277
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,200
detected by the least number of

278
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,239
antiviruses

279
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,880
only 18 and 19. so we take these two

280
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,640
worms

281
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,640
together we build them together

282
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,720
we create another generation and we

283
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,920
slightly mutate

284
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:53,839
each of these worms again

285
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,839
we re-scan all these worms

286
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,399
we see that the middle two ones are the

287
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:01,279
best ones

288
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,600
for our purposes so we merge them

289
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,920
together

290
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:07,680
and now we get to a worm which gets

291
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,120
completely undetected by any of the

292
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,880
antiviruses

293
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,399
so just think about that just be

294
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,640
creating another generation another

295
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,200
generation we reach to the point where

296
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,240
none of the antiviruses is able to find

297
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,800
our new virus

298
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,760
although it really maintains the very

299
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,959
same malicious

300
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:28,399
activities that it had at the beginning

301
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,920
so let's see how it goes the purpose of

302
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,800
this demonstration i chose

303
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,519
the i love you virus for several reasons

304
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,319
first of all

305
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:38,240
uh it's a very old virus i think 20

306
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,560
years old something like that

307
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,399
so most of the anti-viruses in the world

308
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,959
are able to detect it

309
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,680
also since it's it is a very famous

310
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,239
virus

311
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,279
and most of you probably already know of

312
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,000
it

313
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:55,519
um and third is that it was developed in

314
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,399
vivescript so it's very easy for us to

315
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,079
mutate it and while keeping its very

316
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,360
same functionality

317
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:05,120
okay so when i run the original i love

318
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,880
you in my computer

319
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,440
my antivirus blocks it that's great

320
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,320
when i scan it with virustotal it's a

321
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,120
web service

322
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:18,959
that runs i think 57 different

323
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,959
antiviruses against your virus

324
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:26,959
55 so i see that 42 of the antiviruses

325
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,079
are are able to detect it you see it's

326
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,518
all red

327
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,560
okay now we run the genetic algorithm on

328
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,240
the left-hand side

329
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,760
is the execution itself on the right

330
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,399
hand side we see the different

331
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,079
different mutations and i have

332
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,959
accelerated the time a bit

333
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,359
just to fit into the time frame of this

334
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,359
session

335
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,360
and now we got to the what the algorithm

336
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,399
believes

337
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,440
is the best version of the virus okay

338
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:59,040
it's a malicious payload but

339
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:59,040
it completely mutated

340
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:06,560
now when i scan it with my computer

341
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:08,079
with virustotal we see that it gets all

342
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,839
clean

343
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,839
and then when i run it on my computer

344
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:16,959
we see that it it does deliver its

345
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:21,040
malicious payload

346
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:22,239
so no matter how many signatures you add

347
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,040
and you add into

348
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,040
your antivirus still you get to the

349
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,760
point where the virus is able to mutate

350
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,160
itself

351
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,000
so it gets completely undetected by the

352
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,920
antiviruses

353
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
so it might take another generation

354
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,959
another thousand generations it doesn't

355
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,560
really matter

356
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,239
at the end of the day we will get to the

357
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,599
point where the virus gets

358
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,600
completely undetected

359
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:53,839
the next topic i want to talk about

360
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,680
um is whaling and fishing

361
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:58,000
i guess most of you are familiar with

362
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,719
fishing and a question that is raised

363
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,440
very often

364
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,160
is well why there are so many spelling

365
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,880
mistakes

366
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,719
in these phishing mails why can't they

367
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,720
just run

368
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,120
spelling spell checker before sending

369
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,040
these mails

370
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,959
so microsoft looked into that and they

371
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,680
have released a very interesting paper

372
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,239
titled

373
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,959
finally titled as why do nigerian

374
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,839
scammers

375
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:22,560
say they're from nigeria and the

376
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,600
conclusion

377
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:29,119
is that they want to improve

378
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,680
their success rate they want to address

379
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,959
the less knowledgeable and less educated

380
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,680
population

381
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,119
so by having many spelling mistakes the

382
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,680
more knowledgeable people

383
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,560
will not click the links and the ones

384
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,959
that are left

385
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,599
at that funnel still clicking on that

386
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,599
link

387
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,040
are the ones that might be easier to

388
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,160
convince to

389
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:51,040
transfer you some money um so they want

390
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,560
to improve

391
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:57,760
the the conversion rate um

392
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:00,000
so and and by having all these mistakes

393
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,040
they're really able to find the people

394
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,160
um that are

395
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:08,639
easier to convince at the

396
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:11,279
others other side of the spectrum

397
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,120
there is the wailing attack wedding is

398
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,760
very similar to fishing

399
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,639
but fishing goes with spray and prey

400
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,680
where welding

401
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,880
you want to have one specific person in

402
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,959
an organization

403
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,160
that you want to attack because that

404
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,599
specific person

405
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:29,120
has uh the ability to do something that

406
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,920
is very significant to you

407
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,160
or has enough info data for you to to to

408
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,160
get

409
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,199
so about welding having a having a

410
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,199
really a properly welding attack

411
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,920
requires three steps first of all you

412
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:45,439
need to identify the targets

413
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,360
then you need to collect enough

414
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,680
intelligence around that target

415
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,600
to build a very convincing male

416
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:54,719
convincing scenario

417
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,360
and then you need to craft that mail we

418
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,920
will show

419
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,120
how each of these three steps can be

420
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:03,680
automated

421
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:06,240
and and improved and scaled using ai

422
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,638
so starting with identifying targets so

423
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:11,360
far it's been a very manual

424
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,800
process you go to linkedin you go to

425
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,639
different social networks

426
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,479
and you try to understand who's the most

427
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,000
relevant person to attack within an

428
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:21,199
organization

429
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,600
we have built we have built a tool

430
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:25,359
a chrome extension that connects to

431
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,399
linkedin

432
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,560
you mark three people that match

433
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:33,360
the profile that interests you in this

434
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:37,279
case these are software engineers

435
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,839
in an insurance company so you build you

436
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,399
mark

437
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,240
three people only three people and then

438
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:44,240
it automatically shows you

439
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,000
what these people have in common and to

440
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,160
what extent it is in common between

441
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,320
these people

442
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,439
and then the next step once it computes

443
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,959
all these value

444
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,839
it is able to create a google search

445
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,638
in this case it found all the people

446
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,800
within

447
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:05,919
uh in in google that are developers

448
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,159
in an insurance company within the us i

449
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:10,959
think it found more than 500

450
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,520
or europe i think it found more than 500

451
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:16,160
such people in this specific search

452
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,240
so that's the first step of automation

453
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,880
the second step of automation would be

454
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,240
to

455
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,880
gather uh sensitive data around these

456
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,240
people

457
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,280
uh through social network harvesting

458
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,120
be for the third step to build a very

459
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:35,200
convincing male

460
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,159
so i'm just taking kendrick mccarter for

461
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,640
as an example

462
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,919
uh we have found all that information

463
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,039
about this person

464
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,240
in in the social network we saw that in

465
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:48,320
linkedin

466
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:50,640
he was endorsed by gopi cordora valley

467
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,600
uh we see that he's he marked in

468
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,160
linkedin

469
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,678
data analysis as one of his skills and

470
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,840
we saw on instagram

471
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:01,200
that he was on vacation at the venetian

472
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,879
las vegas

473
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,559
in addition to that you said at the

474
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:07,200
success rate

475
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:09,039
based on previous spelling attacks that

476
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:12,240
were performed

477
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:14,720
what's the success rate of an attack

478
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,480
if we use that piece of information we

479
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:18,400
see for example that if we mention the

480
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:21,039
data analysis as a skill

481
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,320
it has only five percent success rate

482
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:25,760
but if we mentioned

483
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:28,720
that he stayed at definition las vegas

484
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,120
it raises our success rate to 24 because

485
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,360
it's

486
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,360
it's probably more tailor-made to that

487
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,959
specific person

488
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,360
and now we get to the interesting part

489
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,600
we can mark two of these attributes for

490
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,678
example endorser and skills

491
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,280
and generate a mail out of these

492
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,240
automatically generate mails

493
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,879
out of these two pieces of information

494
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,200
and

495
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,320
it creates the following web mail dear

496
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,919
kendrick

497
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,240
i've received your information from

498
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,720
gopic odora valley whom i used to work

499
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:56,960
for

500
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:59,520
at vizio i understand from him that

501
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:03,360
you're in the data analytics field

502
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,480
please find my cv i'd be happy to get

503
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,678
your

504
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,400
your thoughts now this mail has a lot of

505
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,720
info

506
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,160
of accurate information i've mentioned

507
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,320
gopi kodara valley

508
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,679
i mentioned visio information that i

509
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,240
took from linkedin

510
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,679
and the data analytics which was marked

511
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,039
as a skill

512
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:26,400
there are high chances that uh

513
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:29,840
the recipient will open that document

514
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:33,280
which installs a keylogger in his

515
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:36,959
office environment another option would

516
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:39,039
have been to select to write the mail

517
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,160
using the vacation at the venetian las

518
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,320
vegas

519
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,760
and then the system creates a mail you

520
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,480
know well

521
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:48,240

kendrick mccarter

544
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:37,120
so it's not like fishing where we just

545
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:38,559
as i said spray and pray tens of

546
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,080
thousands of mail in the hope that

547
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,960
someone will click it

548
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,918
i want one specific person and i build a

549
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:48,320
full attack

550
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:51,760
just for that specific person

551
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:55,200
um there is such a tool

552
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:58,960
uh called snap r and which was by uh

553
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:01,039
by a company called foxpro and that

554
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,880
does something very similar to to what

555
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:06,240
we've see what we've shown

556
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,799
um it is built as a twitter and it has

557
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,720
more than

558
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:13,360
30 percent of click rate okay so snap r

559
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,480
a social network automated fishing with

560
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,879
reconnaissance

561
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,760
and it reached 30 percent quick click

562
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,880
rate

563
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,240
um one of our customers asked us to do

564
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,840
something similar within their

565
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,559
organization

566
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,120
and we were able to get more than 50

567
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,960
percent

568
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:33,439
five zero percent click rate if

569
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:35,120
with their c level executive that's

570
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,760
insane

571
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:41,520
phishing males usually get several pro

572
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:41,520
miles of success rate at the best

573
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,039
usually at this stage of the

574
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,960
presentation people feel that there is

575
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:50,640
no future and there is no hope

576
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,799
hackers are using ai and you know

577
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,400
the kind of the good guys are lagging

578
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:58,000
behind

579
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:01,120
um well check marks us we come to to

580
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:05,120
the rescue and we reverse revolutionize

581
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,559
the upset market every feature every

582
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:09,280
product of ours

583
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:12,320
we think how we can use ai to improve it

584
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,639
to scale it to make it better

585
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,639
starting with result confidence we show

586
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,880
the confidence level of the results

587
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,159
based on ai so once you mark a result as

588
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:22,000
a false positive

589
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,919
we try to learn we have machine learning

590
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,720
capabilities understanding

591
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:27,600
or learning what properties of this

592
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,080
result

593
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,360
make it probably more false positive

594
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,399
prone than others

595
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:36,479
and then we fine-tune the the order and

596
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:38,880
the accuracy of the results

597
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,559
and in our research lab we have many

598
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,919
similar activities

599
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:47,120
for example um by learning

600
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:49,440
how results how to results look like

601
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,280
we try to find similar results in a

602
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,559
somewhat way a similar way

603
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:58,158
how law enforcement agencies find

604
00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:00,240
faces in a large stadium we learn how

605
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:04,559
results look like and we try to find

606
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:06,320
similarities in your specific code

607
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,600
it also allows us the next step it

608
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,678
allows us to

609
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,360
recommend you how to fix your code not

610
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,000
only finding vulnerabilities

611
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,639
but suggesting how to fix your code just

612
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,840
as an example let's say that in in

613
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,880
in the red is how your github code looks

614
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,480
like

615
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,640
we see that it is similar to a

616
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,600
vulnerability which was found already in

617
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,440
github

618
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:33,199
and was fixed uh as such

619
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:37,520
then probably your code should look like

620
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:41,120
the following

621
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:44,720
also as um as security experts

622
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,559
we have intuition i've done hundreds of

623
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,559
code reviews so just by looking at the

624
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,600
code without even finding the first

625
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,678
vulnerability

626
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,678
i got it i have the intuition whether

627
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,400
i'll be able to hack into that system or

628
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:57,520
not

629
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,120
in a similar way the way i hacked into

630
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,360
amazon's alexa

631
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,120
i looked at it something didn't seem

632
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,760
right i knew that i will be able to hack

633
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,959
into it

634
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:08,240
it took me a couple of days so machine

635
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,440
learning is an ai

636
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,760
is the automation of that intuition

637
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,919
if you have a project that you have

638
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,000
mostly junior developers maintaining it

639
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,360
it's very old code based and without

640
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,240
data technology

641
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,559
most probably you want to scan and and

642
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,000
fix

643
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:28,960
this project first versus project b

644
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,039
so feeding in that kind of intuition

645
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,679
will help you to prioritize the scanning

646
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,520
efforts

647
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,520
if you have multiple projects

648
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,520
the next step is for open source

649
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,639
software

650
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:45,279
to build contributor reputa reputation

651
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,000
and when you hire a new developer to

652
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,360
your organization

653
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,279
you must probably do some kind of a

654
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,559
background check that's great

655
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,320
but then you use an open source

656
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,559
component and you have no idea who's

657
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,439
contributing to that project

658
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,080
by having a reputation score you know

659
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,640
that

660
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:02,559
all your all the contributors are

661
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,080
validated or have some kind of a

662
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,799
background they did something in the

663
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,879
past

664
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:08,000
and it's not that they have just joined

665
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,880
the project

666
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
checked in um some piece of code which

667
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,640
you will be using very shortly

668
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
a very recent attack happened a couple

669
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:21,760
of years ago

670
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,520
there was a a component called event

671
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,240
stream

672
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,440
which is was downloaded more than two

673
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,799
million times

674
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:32,960
a week and at a certain moment the main

675
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,840
maintainer of event stream was a bit

676
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:37,120
tired

677
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:39,520
and someone called right nine control um

678
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:42,320
said that he's willing to take that

679
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:44,879
project and to become responsible to it

680
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,559
um and the main maintainer said sure why

681
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,279
not i'm i'm a bit tired

682
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,158
right time control took control and then

683
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,440
he pushed

684
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,240
a bitcoin mining and or cryptocon mining

685
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,600
and stealing

686
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:59,600
soft code into that package and boom

687
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,439
two million installations per week

688
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,639
started

689
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,600
to to mine a currency and to steal

690
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,640
currency

691
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:12,320
from these servers gladly it was

692
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:14,559
a detected very quickly but as a concept

693
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,360
you don't really know who contributes uh

694
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,918
code to

695
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,918
your third-party components so the

696
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:24,000
reputation score

697
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:26,400
is very handy in these environments

698
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
we talked about genetic algorithms we're

699
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,120
looking how we can use genetic

700
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,120
algorithms

701
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:35,918
to automatically build or supporting

702
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:37,199
new languages for us at check marks we

703
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,880
scan your source code

704
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,880
to find vulnerabilities to make sure

705
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,320
that your developers are developing

706
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:46,880
secure code instead of of us having to

707
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:49,520
support each language that you're using

708
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,679
by building good and bad code examples

709
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,799
we can automatically start supporting

710
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,360
new languages

711
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:57,918
with that to manually build these

712
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,918
grammars

713
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:04,480
so just as close as closing words

714
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:06,080
ai is all around us we've shown how

715
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:09,360
hackers are using ai

716
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:12,480
to scale their attacks but as

717
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,158
the good guys as the good guys

718
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:16,720
we use a very similar very similar

719
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:19,600
techniques to improve our finding and

720
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:29,279
detecting capabilities

721
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:29,279
that's it thank you very much
