1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,799
all right welcome back everyone

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,119
so we're going to bring our next

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,960
presentations up very very shortly

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,080
and i noticed i i was told i was still

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,440
alive so thankfully i didn't say

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,080
anything incriminating or very very

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,160
silly

8
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,280
but um yeah i thought that was a really

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,039
good presentation

10
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,080
so it's introduced the the next speakers

11
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,480
that we have coming up they're going to

12
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,000
be

13
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,840
talking around cyber security and

14
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,279
education which

15
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,279
is also kind of close to my heart

16
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,080
because i had my first professional

17
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,480
experience

18
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,080
in cyber security and and sysadmin

19
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,199
actually was working for education

20
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,559
queensland

21
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,480

be talking about

26
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,600
cyber security threats challenges and

27
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,718
definitely the opportunity that's that's

28
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,200
around

29
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,320
in the university sector so without

30
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,719
further ado i'll jump

31
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,800

thanks lucas um and welcome to

35
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,119
obviously cyber security and education

36
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,920
uh thank you for everyone

37
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,960
attending today and we really appreciate

38
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:13,600
it

39
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:17,119
so we'll kick off and we will

40
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,880
go straight into who who we are um so

41
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,600
my name is billy hunter i'm the cyber

42
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,119
ops manager at uwa i've been here about

43
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,839
four years

44
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,360
i've got approximately 13 years security

45
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,320
experience in higher education and the

46
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,520
health sectors

47
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,479
and unfortunately my or

48
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,200
2020 shirt didn't fit me so i'm thinking

49
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,520
that's a

50
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,920
swim fit i'm gordon mitrovic

51
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,360
he's the cyber security operations

52
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,200
specialist so he's a cyber

53
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,759
transformation product owner

54
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,600
and he's been here 12 years at uwa he's

55
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,439
part of the furniture

56
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,798
and he's got 10 years cyber experience

57
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,398
and obviously higher education in

58
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,479
government as well

59
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,320
um the interesting fact about gordon is

60
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,920
that i'm going to get his larger shirt

61
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,919
um because mine doesn't fit

62
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,839
so we're going to cover um the threat

63
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,440
landscape today so what is uwa

64
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,479
seeing some of the challenges so what it

65
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,800
was like before

66
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:13,760
and what it was like um you know after

67
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,440
um

68
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,920
you know some of the data ingestion

69
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,520
challenges some of the data analysis

70
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,200
and obviously the gaps that we

71
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,800
identified we're going to chat about

72
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,238
obviously the reporting the metrics and

73
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,239
the alerting

74
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,319
as well we're going to have a quick chat

75
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,480
about threat intelligence and how uwa

76
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:31,518
are utilizing threat intelligence and

77
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,560
how it's a benefit

78
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,120
um to proactive threat detection and

79
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,400
then

80
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,160
at the end we're going to chat about

81
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,400
security awareness how we take all this

82
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,440
data and it feeds our security awareness

83
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,800
program

84
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,480
and just a little bit over the end

85
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,239
obviously to chat about the teamwork and

86
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,720
the culture as well

87
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:50,400
now um we do have a q a you can pop

88
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,879
something in the chat window

89
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,519
and if we have time we'll take some um

90
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,920
questions

91
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,440
but if we don't have time and uh we can

92
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,238
we can obviously chat in the foyer or

93
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,239
we'll meet

94
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,360
in another room okay really quickly

95
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,000
sorry billy do you mind sharing your

96
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,920
screen with the presentation

97
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,400
because we will kind of see all three

98
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,799
lovely faces

99
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,400
yeah that does help doesn't it oh it's

100
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,480
it's um

101
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,720
you're on mute or share your screen

102
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:21,200
that's the common factor

103
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,200
how's that

104
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,959
thank you very much is that much better

105
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,958
thanks vickers

106
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,280
so we're going to talk about the threat

107
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,400
landscape today and

108
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,000
what it looks like at uwa

109
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,519
so in the past many of our incidents

110
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,799
were just script kiddies you know our

111
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,720
own wheels just looking for

112
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,720
opportunities

113
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,239
and and that's just back in the day now

114
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,720
we're seeing like complex

115
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,040
targeted attacks um from kind of

116
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,239
well-oiled machines

117
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,000
you know and i like to say they wipe

118
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,000
their feet in the way in and they leave

119
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
the door open in their way out

120
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,720
they're there to stay they're walking in

121
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,920
every corner and um you know the art of

122
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,720
actually going unnoticed as well

123
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,359
so just quickly you know 122 disclosed

124
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,519
attacks

125
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,120
i am relating to obviously the education

126
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,640
in the research sector were reported to

127
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,480
acsc

128
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,159
so we are a target and we're being

129
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,680
targeted you know for things like you

130
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,040
know ransomware

131
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,358
so i'm going to mention networking and

132
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,280
maze um primarily in the news

133
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:26,000
um recently um with more and more

134
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,320
headlines you know appearing daily

135
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,840
and this is a concern obviously um no

136
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,919
one likes ransomware

137
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,000
and the education center is definitely a

138
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:37,039
target um for that

139
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,600
we're also seeing uh a rise in ddos

140
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,240
attacks

141
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,880
so we're seeing multiple people scanning

142
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,560
our um

143
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:47,759
external um assets and just

144
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,440
trying to scrape stuff so that's quite

145
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,320
interesting we're looking

146
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,000
for those patterns um we're obviously

147
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,240
doing a bit of investigation as well

148
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,400
i'm trying to figure out um you know

149
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,759
what's going on

150
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,039
we see an increase in fishing on spear

151
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:07,440
phishing attacks as well

152
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:11,039
so against you know researchers and vips

153
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,919
um we actually um

154
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,840
have seen a number of covered 19 um

155
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,758
related emails coming in

156
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,359
um over the last you know six months or

157
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,440
so and i'm sure everyone's seeing them

158
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,520
as well

159
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,240
a significant increase in business email

160
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,719
compromise um so over the last 12 months

161
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:30,400
um you know there's been many attempts

162
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,960
um

163
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,320
hitting kind of low target employees and

164
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,520
then working their way up

165
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,719
i'm so someone that has obviously a

166
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,840
direct path

167
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,720
to someone of importance um and these

168
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,159
are becoming more common

169
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,680
the exploitation of vulnerabilities as

170
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,240
well we've obviously get citrix and

171
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,720
pulse

172
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,560
telerik as well um some of the most

173
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,680
sophisticated tradecraft

174
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,680
um observed i am i'm sure everybody was

175
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,840
rushing to patch their systems

176
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,280
and very quickly and even in the news

177
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,239
this morning

178
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,239
um you know there's reports of you still

179
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:09,600
citrix compromises and stuff as well

180
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,479
so yeah quite alarming we're monitoring

181
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,160
the dart web

182
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,919
and obviously the pace bins and data

183
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,759
dumps as well um alerts are coming

184
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,479
through on a consistent basis

185
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:20,319
with obviously external um websites and

186
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,680
stuff compromised and we are following

187
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:25,199
up on that to keep our users safe

188
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,880
and we've got data of interest you know

189
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,000
so we're a research university

190
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:31,680
um you know we're obviously in perth i'm

191
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,520
quite isolated as well but we are doing

192
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,560
some really good research

193
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,080
um so we have data of interest uh and

194
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,600
that's what we're trying to protect

195
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,599
um so we are a target

196
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,000
so what was it like before and what was

197
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,120
it like after

198
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,560
let's have a chat about this so

199
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,280
this is what it was like before you can

200
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,960
see 2017. so things were a little bit

201
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,919
more calmer back then

202
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,520
um i think everyone can agree the

203
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,039
problem with that was that the cyber

204
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,799
team would spend hours and hours and

205
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,919
hours with limited logs

206
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,080
and and no real source of truth so we'd

207
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,359
waste a lot of time

208
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,840
and i like to describe it as um

209
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,280
more like a jigsaw puzzle okay so you've

210
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,599
only got half of the pieces

211
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,198
and it's frustrating you know so you

212
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,880
take out the box you try and build it

213
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,000
you realize half the pieces are there

214
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,759
and you're wasting your time so we did a

215
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,280
massive capability

216
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,599
and maturity uplift um and

217
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,638
we've really turned down the corner and

218
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,440
as you can see

219
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,919
there's a lot more um items there and to

220
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,000
give us that clearer picture

221
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:43,198
i mean incidents would often be caused

222
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,080
um you know without um

223
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,599
without any knowledge any understanding

224
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,359
any understanding of um

225
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,280
you know the patterns or attack um

226
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,560
surface or geolocation or

227
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:57,198
anything um with multiple consoles

228
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,080
and efficient searching techniques um no

229
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,639
baseline

230
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,080
um and legacy technologies were really

231
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:05,280
just embedded

232
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,599
and so that really caused concern

233
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,440
and we even had missing logs most of the

234
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,240
time you know you would um go searching

235
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,639
for logs and

236
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,680
and there was none um and one of the

237
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,440
benefits we had

238
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:19,120
um was to you know map out our

239
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,800
an internal network finally we

240
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:23,120
understood what was out there

241
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,120
we understood the external footprint and

242
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,919
we identified the gaps you know we were

243
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,919
able to do

244
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,240
proactive detection of attacks and

245
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,840
obviously their patterns as well

246
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,640
and we found out what end users were up

247
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,159
to um you know it was the insider threat

248
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:41,760
and we were interested in that as well

249
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:44,560
so again we had the bigger picture

250
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,720
so what were the challenges everyone

251
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,959
loves logs

252
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,440
you start off with one log and then

253
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,119
suddenly it becomes multiple logs

254
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,640
and then before you know it you've got

255
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,399
too many logs

256
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,839
and that's the issue you really need to

257
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,279
have a plan

258
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,040
you need to define your requirements

259
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,080
straight off the bat um

260
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:06,880
and not just ingest everything i'm start

261
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,480
small that's your tip

262
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,160
and you'll come across as i say varying

263
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,080
world formats the

264
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,600
and and obviously sources you know

265
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,360
they're in different different formats

266
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,200
and stuff what's the logic of the logs

267
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,480
what format are they in do they even

268
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,399
exist

269
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,600
um that was just some of the challenges

270
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,480
that uwa faced

271
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,480
in the very beginning

272
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,080
and it's not a race everybody's keen to

273
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,640
just

274
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,600
jump ahead you know show growth and show

275
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:35,519
effort

276
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:39,680
build dashboards combine correlate data

277
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:42,000
take your time you need to plan

278
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,479
so start small build some use cases we

279
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
suggest probably five to ten

280
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,519
and then obviously gather the feedback

281
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,640
and then refine them

282
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,360
if you don't do that you're going to get

283
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,680
a lot of noise and that noise is going

284
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,240
to

285
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,760
actually just get in the way and that's

286
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,279
what we found we made mistakes in the

287
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,560
beginning

288
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:03,120
and definitely develop a road map that's

289
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,319
definitely a tip that i would um suggest

290
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,519
you know have a plan

291
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,600
so in three months you're gonna have

292
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,800
five to ten use cases you know

293
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,640
in six to twelve months you're gonna

294
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,479
have 20 to 30 use cases

295
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,839
you know and what are those use cases as

296
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,000
well

297
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,640
and gordon the way he'll chat through

298
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,399
this um later on in the presentation

299
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,040
and we suggest obviously starting with

300
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,560
your crown jewels what's important

301
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,519
what's the most critical systems in your

302
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:29,599
network what should you be monitoring

303
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,279
we also suggest obviously aligning with

304
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,640
a miter attack framework

305
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,079
but don't try and cover all of these

306
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,199
vectors you're never g you're going to

307
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,120
waste your time

308
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,800
you're never going to cover it so try

309
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,519
and align that with them who's trying to

310
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,079
attack you

311
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:45,200
and as i said earlier on that's down to

312
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,719
identifying the patterns

313
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,720
so the data allowed us to measure some

314
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,959
metrics so we

315
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,920
input you know applied a new control or

316
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,319
we tweaked something

317
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,040
um we could show value back to the

318
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,640
business

319
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,319
and that's what it was all about it was

320
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,640
about you know

321
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,760
we're going to turn a b and c on and

322
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:05,199
this is going to deliver

323
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:08,640
e f and g and that's very important

324
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,800
and again use our gel methodology

325
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,319
you're going to be constantly pausing

326
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,640
reevaluating

327
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,480
readjusting figuring out what you're

328
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,560
doing um because

329
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,120
you know this was a beast it was a beast

330
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,119
of a project

331
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,880
and what did they what did the data tell

332
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,160
us well

333
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,680
we had gaps with lots of gaps um

334
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,319
it gave us an overview as i said of a

335
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,279
network and it gave us a good the bad

336
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,800
and obviously they're doing very ugly

337
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,800
weird assets obviously

338
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,560
we didn't realize they were exposed and

339
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,040
we coverage issues um

340
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,040
with some of our platforms as well we

341
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,519
thought we had coverage we didn't

342
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,199
and obviously the health of our estate

343
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,040
was questionable

344
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,399
but that was good because we had to

345
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,519
start um

346
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,760
we we knew what we were up against so

347
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,279
we digested that data and had a really

348
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,560
good understanding of our wrist posture

349
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,560
and obviously what was required to

350
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,020
uplift the capability as well

351
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,239
so the hard work started um

352
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:09,600
[Music]

353
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,160
so i'm going to pass you over to goran

354
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:15,360
just now um and he's going to go

355
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,480
um you know a bit more in-depth you know

356
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,480
the reporting and metrics

357
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:28,239
thank you billy okay um yeah well

358
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,719
as billy has mentioned we're on this

359
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,920
journey of maturity uplift so

360
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,800
um what we're going to discuss in the

361
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,319
next few slides is just look

362
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,560
at a little bit more detail in terms of

363
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,560
the journey we took some of the

364
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,319
some of the factors that we considered

365
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,518
when we're planning and building our

366
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,360
road maps

367
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:46,800
obviously can't cover a lot due to time

368
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,240
constraints um so

369
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,839
it might seem a little bit high level

370
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,120
but we're happy to share more

371
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,320
information

372
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:57,440
later on okay

373
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:59,360
so we'll kick off by

374
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,079
looking at uh yeah where we started

375
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,079
basically so

376
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,518
i guess what we're about to look at here

377
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,079
is the journey that uwa has taken over

378
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,240
the last

379
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,920
12 to 18 months uh and i hope that what

380
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,920
we shared will help others

381
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,519
um we're still on this journey with you

382
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,519
know with it i don't think it's

383
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,720
it ever ends for us um but we've

384
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,440
definitely made a step in the right

385
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,959
direction we've learned a lot

386
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:25,760
i'm a firm believer that knowledge is

387
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,839
power and without knowledge and facts

388
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,120
improvement is often achieved by trial

389
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,959
and error

390
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,560
in cyber i think for many organizations

391
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,518
particularly for us

392
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,040
i mean there's little time for

393
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,160
experimenting and second guessing

394
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,079
ourselves

395
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,360
um therefore having facts will help us

396
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,920
um drive

397
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,880
improvements in defenses uh that'll help

398
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,719
us keep up with the

399
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:48,079
ever-growing threat landscape that billy

400
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,800
just described in detail earlier on

401
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,359
so accurate data logs and intel are

402
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
vital

403
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,240
and that will help generate metrics and

404
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,920
alerts that will give factual

405
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,360
information to help us move the needle

406
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,199
in the right direction

407
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,880
in our case we want to be more proactive

408
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,959
rather than reactive

409
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,760
which which i think we're on our on our

410
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,760
path to getting there

411
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:11,440
so what we're about about to share with

412
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:14,160
you um wasn't an easy feat

413
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,760
we're constantly learning and refining

414
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,959
and we're not afraid to make mistakes

415
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,000
and learn from them and i think that's

416
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,479
probably one of the most important

417
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,959
things

418
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:22,000
have a plan have a road map be prepared

419
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:25,199
to learn

420
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,920
um go back review revise um that's

421
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,599
that's the

422
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,439
one thing that we've learned and working

423
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,839
in agile methodology definitely helps

424
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,839
that

425
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:37,920
so what were our main drivers

426
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,000
as mentioned briefly before i think our

427
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,160
goals were to lift our sub in maturity

428
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,440
and detect and protect the mains and to

429
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,880
achieve this we need to increase

430
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,959
visibility

431
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,880
we wanted to turn the data and the logs

432
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,079
and intel into meaningful metrics and

433
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,639
alerts

434
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,599
we want to maximize our technology to

435
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,240
help us

436
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,199
identify and mitigate threats we want to

437
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,360
be in a position

438
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,439
where we can investigate and understand

439
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,800
the what's in the wise

440
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,639
so as billy mentioned before there was a

441
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,079
lot of frustration in the past where we

442
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:07,839
just didn't have those capabilities

443
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,279
something happened

444
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,160
we found that after the fact that we

445
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,519
didn't really understand why it happened

446
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:15,519
and we wanted to use this data and

447
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,639
knowledge to help us make informed

448
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,920
decisions

449
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,279
to mitigate these threats and risks

450
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:24,240
into the future and to refine and

451
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,240
improve our controls

452
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,399
so ultimately how did we achieve that um

453
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,079
we set out a simple plan

454
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,680
and that was to increase visibility

455
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,959
which would ultimately help us detect

456
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,880
the non-bad

457
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,959
we can then use that information to help

458
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,279
us reduce our exposure

459
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,160
and it'll help us move towards threat

460
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,959
hunting

461
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,040
so looking for the unknowns that are not

462
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,319
so obvious

463
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,399
and we're certainly heading in that

464
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,519
direction and we're moving towards that

465
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:52,000
hedge front head

466
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,959
threat hunting space now so some of the

467
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,639
top tips

468
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,239
i think someone's been mentioned before

469
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,680
i think it's important that when you

470
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,120
start and look at any of this don't try

471
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,079
and boil the ocean i think we discovered

472
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,240
this pretty quickly

473
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,719
um they're trying to do too much at once

474
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:07,360
you set yourself up for failure

475
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,560
focus on really what's important and go

476
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,560
for the quick and easy ones

477
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,160
so how do we go from i guess all the

478
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,079
logs all the data and all the threading

479
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:22,719
totals producing alerts and metrics

480
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,519
that help us ultimately drive maturity

481
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,120
uplift

482
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,560
we asked ourselves some simple questions

483
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,000
to help us the role that was important

484
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,359
to us

485
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,920
we also accepted the fact that we'll

486
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:34,000
never be able to block all the bad stuff

487
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,040
we're in higher education after all

488
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,560
we're not a bank

489
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:41,199
uh we're made up of um many types of

490
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,880
i guess users we have managed unmanaged

491
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,639
affiliates of the network et cetera it's

492
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,399
a challenging environment

493
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,680
so we knew from the start that will not

494
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,680
be able to stop

495
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,439
and block everything we can't enforce

496
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,359
policies to stop everything that

497
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,600
is not acceptable that you know doesn't

498
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,360
look right it looks bad

499
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,279
we developed a plan that was reflective

500
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,079
of our capability maturity at the time

501
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,279
so we were true and honest to ourselves

502
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,000
i think we have to start with small

503
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,359
steps and build

504
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,359
from there and constantly review that

505
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,520
what we did is we started with some use

506
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,919
cases and again

507
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,359
um what you can see here are some high

508
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,520
level typical use cases

509
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,119
and for us um it was it was all around

510
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,439
prioritizing use cases where

511
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,559
logs and data was present and easy to

512
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,160
obtain

513
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,599
and we had a couple of goes with this

514
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,199
and initially you know were pretty

515
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,879
ambitious around what we wanted to get

516
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:30,480
and we quickly found that without the

517
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,919
logs and the data to support those we

518
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,000
were not really getting anywhere we're

519
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,679
getting bogged down and trying to get

520
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,120
information and logs that wasn't present

521
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,760
rather than focusing what was available

522
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,000
to us

523
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:45,679
and making the most of it um

524
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
for for the rest we built steps into our

525
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,080
plan

526
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,520
to address where there was log and data

527
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,000
gaps

528
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,520
we're focusing on uk use case use cases

529
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,039
and controls that will

530
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,280
you know help us answer the questions

531
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,200
that kept us up at night

532
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,440
some of the use cases that we

533
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,640
implemented um and it continued to

534
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,720
tuning and

535
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,640
optimizing uh around the malware

536
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,280
ransomware phishing previous account

537
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,120
activity

538
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:11,200
network activity monitoring electoral

539
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,879
movement so those typical things that

540
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,200
billy spoke about that sort of keep us

541
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,240
awake at night where we had

542
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,200
relative gaps around visibility and

543
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,679
we've

544
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,440
driven a maturity uplift in this space

545
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,039
which also helped us quite

546
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:27,200
extensively in being able to develop

547
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,879
these use cases and as billy mentioned

548
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,280
before our use cases are all based on

549
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,919
the

550
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,760
motor attack framework and our focus was

551
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:35,600
to ensure that we had coverage across

552
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,080
the entire cyber kill chain where

553
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,080
possible

554
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,200
from a logs log and data sources point

555
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,760
of view

556
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,520
we've been quite fortunate that along

557
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,600
this journey of maturity we

558
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,440
invested quite a lot of effort into also

559
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,719
uplifting capabilities on our technical

560
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,200
controls

561
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,559
and this really enabled us to get some

562
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:00,880
really rich

563
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,879
login data sources that helped us

564
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,280
make those use cases a lot more valuable

565
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,320
to us

566
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,120
some of the things that we focused on we

567
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,399
want to

568
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,239
have a really good understanding of

569
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,760
coverage of our cyber security controls

570
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,080
and how effective they were

571
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,679
um so that the predominantly focus was

572
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,520
on those particular cyber controls that

573
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,280
we had and they're fairly typical for uh

574
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,120
for a same implementation

575
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,960
um we're focused predominantly around

576
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,080
network security controls to firewall

577
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,240
ips

578
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,120
application firewalls email protection

579
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,240
work filtering

580
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:33,840
endpoint protection and vulnerability

581
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,960
management tools

582
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,360
and then we supported those by ingesting

583
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:43,039
some application logs authentication

584
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:44,320
logs and some asset information

585
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:46,080
but the most important thing that we

586
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,200
learned along the way was that

587
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,678
continual improvement was vital in all

588
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,280
of this

589
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,320
so you couldn't just implement something

590
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:57,520
leave it and not not go back to it

591
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,600
so we constantly had to go back refine

592
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:00,799
refiner alerts to eliminate false

593
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:04,559
positives learn

594
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:06,480
from our mistakes and refine the data

595
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,840
and our use case is constantly being

596
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,360
revalidated

597
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,720
and prioritized based on internal

598
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,520
external factors such as threat

599
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,840
intelligence

600
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,639
or any current campaigns that are

601
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,918
targeting us

602
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,840
for example um top tip here is there's

603
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,880
no perfect plan as i mentioned before be

604
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,918
prepared to go back

605
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,919
and review and improve

606
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,480
so after all of that we've uh we've

607
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,280
developed

608
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,280
quite an extensive

609
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:36,799
reporting and metrics capability um

610
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,480
you know we started from a fairly low

611
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:40,080
base where we didn't really have

612
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,880
anything and over the last 12 months

613
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,199
we've developed

614
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,320
reporting metrics that includes over 20

615
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,320
reports and dashboards

616
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,600
our reports are fairly dynamic they

617
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,840
allow us to filter

618
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:54,240
on particular parameters uh and allow

619
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,000
for reporting over custom time periods

620
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,080
um and we're now in a position where we

621
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,679
can answer questions fairly quickly

622
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,879
and the other important thing is that we

623
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:02,880
distribute our reports

624
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,840
amongst our amongst our stakeholders

625
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,159
so our reporting hierarchy structure

626
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,520
looks i'm going to share this with you

627
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,120
right now so it looks a little bit like

628
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:17,520
this so we start at the very bottom

629
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,360
we've got operational level dashboards

630
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,120
and reports the primary focus of those

631
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,559
is for alerting monitoring of the cyber

632
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,399
related threat events

633
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:27,678
and these reports predominantly used by

634
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,440
cyber operation infrastructure teams

635
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,600
on top of that we've developed a number

636
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:33,200
of second level reports

637
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,439
these provide coverage and compliance

638
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,480
metrics for a number of cyber security

639
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,080
controls

640
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:41,679
in addition to provide threatened vet

641
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,799
metrics reports as well

642
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:48,320
these are used by a number of our teams

643
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:51,918
across unity they provide key

644
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:53,360
threat and event metrics and are used in

645
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,640
loading dashboards as well and these

646
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,240
compliance and threat metrics are

647
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,960
summarized upwards to provide

648
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,679
high level reports and these high-level

649
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:01,360
reports

650
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:03,120
provide a summary of the key key

651
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,399
coverage and compliance threat metrics

652
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,399
across all of our controls

653
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:12,960
and these are also shared amongst our

654
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,200
sydney leadership team

655
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,159
so what we're going to cover um in the

656
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,240
next few slides

657
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,080
is um as you can see we've got quite a

658
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,440
potential number of reports here

659
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,120
we'll just deep dive into a couple of

660
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,440
them we'll specifically look at

661
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,039
external exposure and asset encryption

662
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,360
just to demo some of the capability that

663
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,360
we have

664
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,000
so you can see example of one of our

665
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,120
reports which is a

666
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,640
external exposure and what we really

667
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,000
wanted to understand is what our public

668
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,400
footprint looked like

669
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,840
um this report's been built

670
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,440
predominantly on

671
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,120
logs and data that's been ingested and

672
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,039
generated by

673
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,559
our vulnerability management solution

674
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,919
and it's been backed up by some

675
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:58,320
network and asset information as well

676
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:00,320
some of the key metrics you can see here

677
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,480
so predominantly we can see

678
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:05,280
exactly how many assets were exposed

679
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:09,280
publicly how many those are vulnerable

680
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:10,799
we can also trend and see how the

681
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,320
how those vulnerabilities have tracked

682
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,559
over a period of time in this particular

683
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,678
case we're trended over six months

684
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,879
and at a glance we can very quickly see

685
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:23,840
what the breakdown of what those

686
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,840
vulnerabilities are by severity

687
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,360
if we'll drill a bit further down into

688
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:28,799
this report

689
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,439
we can actually also have a look

690
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:32,960
specifically what those assets are that

691
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,400
are exposed and vulnerable

692
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,840
and in our case as i mentioned before

693
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,960
we're part of university so the

694
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,720
challenge is that

695
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,080
not everything that is on our network is

696
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,760
managed so

697
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,520
we were quite interested to understand

698
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,000
um what was a breakup between managed

699
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,440
unmanaged and we quickly identify that

700
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,520
we can also quickly identify the

701
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:51,760
ownership based on

702
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,799
network zones or where those assets are

703
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,799
located etc

704
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:01,520
further into this report we can we can

705
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,480
drill down a bit more and get specific

706
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:07,679
information around

707
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:10,240
based on severity criticality etc we can

708
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:13,600
identify assets that we want to focus on

709
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,919
which help us focus on remediation

710
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,918
efforts

711
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:21,120
and lastly um as i mentioned before we

712
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,679
want to know that

713
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:26,080
where we are and how we can remediate

714
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,480
prioritize

715
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,080
remediation around some of this exposure

716
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,840
so what we also do we

717
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,360
fine-tune our use cases to generate

718
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,360
alerts

719
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,959
and trigger high severity alerts for

720
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,600
targeted systems that when they're at

721
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,200
risk

722
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,158
um or exposed based on the data that we

723
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,559
gather

724
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,720
from from what we've just seen so in

725
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,720
this particular case

726
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,080
our use cases generate high value alerts

727
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,799
that basically tell us that if we know

728
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,199
that a

729
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:56,639
critical system is exposed we can

730
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,640
actually do something about it

731
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,000
the next example that we're going to

732
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,600
have a look at here

733
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,600
is around asset encryption

734
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,880
and this report is basically used to

735
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,919
make a smart decisions around controls

736
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,279
and risk remediation around some of our

737
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:16,400
critical assets

738
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:18,000
i think not long ago all of us

739
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,400
experienced a shift in how we operate

740
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,480
and how we work we moved away from the

741
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,000
office and we started working from home

742
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,520
so for many organizations like this

743
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,600
including ours this resulted in a number

744
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,679
of challenges

745
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:32,000
and exposes to risks that we potentially

746
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,720
weren't prepared for

747
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,240
device encryption is is something that

748
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,640
we were particularly interested in

749
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,600
um and the availability of logs and data

750
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,919
meant that we could

751
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,120
quickly and easily understand the risk

752
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,919
exposure

753
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,719
for certain assets and particularly user

754
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,919
types

755
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,200
and as you can see this particular

756
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:55,520
report here we can quickly drill down

757
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:57,039
by the business units asset types user

758
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:59,039
types etc and

759
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:01,279
quickly get metrics around how many

760
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,799
assets you know we have that are in that

761
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,960
particular

762
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:07,600
domain and what their status is on

763
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:11,039
encryption etc

764
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:12,879
and we were able to use these reports

765
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,679
to drive remediation efforts and quickly

766
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,000
identify assets that were a risk

767
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,679
um we could also look at things like the

768
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,080
operating systems that we have across

769
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,919
those

770
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:26,158
domains which again will help us

771
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,159
remediate or drive remediation efforts

772
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:31,279
furthermore these reports provide a

773
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:35,039
detailed breakdown

774
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:36,880
of assets and users

775
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,080
and this information is shared with our

776
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,799
teams that are responsible for

777
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,799
remediation

778
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,960
as you can see during through this

779
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,879
report

780
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,880
the finally what i want to talk about

781
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,559
again is from a use case point of view

782
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,679
so we use this information to reach our

783
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,320
use cases

784
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:55,760
and in this particular case if we know

785
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,399
that we have assets or users that are

786
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,840
particularly

787
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:00,480
vulnerable or exposed for whatever

788
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,039
reasons in this particular instance if

789
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,520
users if another end users aren't

790
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:08,158
end-user devices aren't encrypted

791
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,720
we can prioritize our alerting for those

792
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:12,159
user types or devices and generate high

793
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,640
quality alerts

794
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:16,159
to help our team to respond and

795
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:21,440
remediate

796
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:22,799
and be informed to make better decisions

797
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,720
and i think that brings me to the end of

798
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:34,158
my presentation so i'll hand over back

799
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:36,880
to billy

800
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,720
gordon um yeah we're just going to chat

801
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,840
about threat and telling you just now

802
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:45,360
okay obviously how important

803
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,840
threat intelligence is um and it's like

804
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:49,039
having

805
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,559
an extension to your team so

806
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,158
what is threat intelligence everybody

807
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:53,039
probably knows it's to act with purpose

808
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,760
and context

809
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:57,039
to proactively reduce threat and risk

810
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,640
and obviously to give us

811
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:03,200
um or can kind of swan the the balance

812
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,360
in our favor

813
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,240
and this is kind of how we're using it

814
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,600
okay so

815
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,399
um we ingest all of the data and we

816
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,520
overlay

817
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:17,039
with um the three intel providers um

818
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:19,279
we ingest that into a same and then we

819
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:22,640
go through the process of of automating

820
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:24,399
um and then we take action on it as well

821
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,720
now i'll have to admit the automation

822
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:29,199
part is something that we

823
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,399
are looking into um it's not fully

824
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:33,440
automated at the moment

825
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:35,600
um and one thing i would probably have

826
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,039
to say in order to automate you nearly

827
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:39,520
really need to have really good run

828
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:41,600
books and playbooks

829
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,639
and good processes and procedures behind

830
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,240
the scenes

831
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,720
never try and automate something unless

832
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:49,840
these um things are in place

833
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:53,760
so that's um that's a kind of top tip

834
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:58,158
um from me i'm with regards to

835
00:28:53,760 --> 00:29:00,399
obviously strategic intelligence um we

836
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,360
now have recorded future um they have

837
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,799
been a big part

838
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,879
i'm into extending um what used to be

839
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,559
kind of operational intelligence

840
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,360
and where we would just obviously have

841
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:13,279
the the shas the ips

842
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,799
um you know the website blocking the

843
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:17,120
kind of normal stuff we're now

844
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,240
slanting towards that strategic

845
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,320
intelligence

846
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,480
and we're now taking that on obviously

847
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:25,520
the you've seen the um

848
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,240
nation state attack collects um we're

849
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,320
utilizing

850
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,320
the intelligence that um record the

851
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,320
future is providing

852
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:34,320
and we're feeding that up to the board

853
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:37,439
um and obviously to our

854
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,840
foreign interference and board as well

855
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,679
so that's helping shape decisions i'm

856
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,399
out with cyber security

857
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,200
i'm at another level i am so that just

858
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,799
shows you how

859
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:50,000
important threat intelligence is

860
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:51,279
and i'm going to chat about security

861
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
awareness i mentioned this at the

862
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,640
beginning

863
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,080
and this is all for a purpose um this is

864
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:58,399
all for a reason

865
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,600
and obviously we identified multiple

866
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,279
opportunities

867
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,360
to feed into our security awareness

868
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:04,799
program you know some of the reports

869
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,399
that we have you know we can

870
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,200
what's the top targeted department for

871
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:12,320
email who's a top targeted individual

872
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:15,360
again who's the top targeted vip

873
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:17,520
who's researcher you know what's the top

874
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,639
ten email issues emails subjects and

875
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,879
attachments

876
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:24,399
i.e who's trying to attack us and what

877
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,000
techniques are they trying to attack us

878
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:28,158
with

879
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
top 10 users of interest you know so

880
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,799
who's doing stuff on our network um

881
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
whether it be

882
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:36,080
you know um downloading a file

883
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,919
suffering internet say you know they'll

884
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,158
see to command and control traffic

885
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,760
and from their machines and what's the

886
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,720
top 10 machines of interest

887
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,279
is it within a student area as a faculty

888
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,240
um

889
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:50,000
these kind of questions we can answer

890
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,320
and that what that does is it provides

891
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,840
us with that over overarching picture of

892
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,240
you know

893
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,959
can we tailor security and awareness

894
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,919
programs

895
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:02,080
um to certain departments so for

896
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:04,159
instance we can then download emails we

897
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:07,600
can download attachments we can then

898
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:11,200
try and um target our fishing campaigns

899
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:13,840
with a similar type of attacks and and

900
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,240
the the results are astounding you know

901
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,918
we

902
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,240
we're reducing our click rate we're

903
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:21,279
getting more things um

904
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,960
reported to us we've implemented a fish

905
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:25,360
report button as well

906
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,200
um we've introduced safe links we've

907
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:29,439
introduced the lastpass

908
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,039
there's a lot of um you know things that

909
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,159
we've helped improve our security

910
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:35,679
awareness

911
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:38,799
program and we're learning all the time

912
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:41,279
um and i think it's probably

913
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:42,080
um safe to say as well that we have

914
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:45,279
instilled

915
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:46,000
cyber um with the help of our

916
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:48,240
stakeholders

917
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,200
as well it's on the tip of everybody's

918
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,799
lips um

919
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,960
and we're obviously we've developed a

920
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:55,440
cyber ambassador program

921
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:56,320
as well so making someone within

922
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,880
different areas

923
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,080
and responsible for cyber in that area

924
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,399
and kind of you know

925
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:03,279
promoting the cyber security team and

926
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,320
that's um

927
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:07,519
really important and teamwork and

928
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,439
culture you know

929
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,559
all these words down the left-hand side

930
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,320
here um

931
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:16,720
are pivotal to um the success at uwa

932
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,080
we're a team um it's one of the best

933
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,399
teams i've ever worked with

934
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,760
um we're really passionate about um you

935
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:24,479

00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,039
and obviously delivering um you know the

937
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,080
the

938
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:29,840
the cyber the cyber journey um

939
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,480
you know it's it's been a massive change

940
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:35,760
from 2017 to 2020

941
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,480
um and you know i i'd just like to say

942
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,399
you know

943
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,480
thank you to to every single one of the

944
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:43,840
the people that you have worked with

945
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:47,440
um as well without without you guys um

946
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:50,320
none of this would have been possible um

947
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:52,159
so we'll go to the kind of q a um if we

948
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,399
have time i'm not too sure

949
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,519
she'll be nudged um but lucas you can

950
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:58,080
jump in

951
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:59,679
um but if anybody has any questions we

952
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:02,158
can go to 410

953
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,039
jump in the foyer or you can email us as

954
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:05,519
well

955
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,720
yeah fantastic we do have one minute i

956
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,720
mean the next presentation

957
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:10,480
is pre-recorded in 38 minutes long so we

958
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,480
do have a bit of a buffer time so

959
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,000
there have been a lot of questions which

960
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,240
is good so you guys are gonna make a

961
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,120
little new friends as a result i think

962
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,440
um and the main jump into the q a bit

963
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,279
and

964
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,320
the main area was um uh how much effort

965
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,039
was this obviously it's run over a few

966
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:30,399
years but

967
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:30,399
ultimately how much effort was there

968
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,919
yeah i could probably um probably answer

969
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,559
that um

970
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,159
you know we went from a very small team

971
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:41,918
so 2017

972
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:45,679
2016 2017 there was around about two

973
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:48,320
to three people within the cyber team we

974
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:48,799
have increased our head count i am to

975
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,080
seven

976
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,799
and obviously we've brought in other

977
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,840
resources as we went along the journey

978
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,559
there is a lot of effort to obviously

979
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,840
uplifting

980
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:02,879
um your capability and maturity um

981
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:04,158
across the sector um and that's with you

982
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:07,440
know infrastructure

983
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:09,280
and its processes it's transformation

984
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,560
it's getting rid of the noise so we did

985
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,720
a lot of cyber work

986
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:17,918
um which was non beneficial to the team

987
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:19,359
um we brought in a new um

988
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:20,960
associate director at the start of our

989
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,319
journey who's very focused and very

990
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,320
driven as well

991
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,919
um and he's came from a banking

992
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,440
background as well

993
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:32,638
um and really he's been at the helm um

994
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,200
he's as i say very very passionate but

995
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:36,320
cyber

996
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:39,359
um and wants to make a difference at uwa

997
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:39,359
so a lot of effort

998
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,679
yeah i i bet so we're very very well

999
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:46,078
done and that's and that's the sentiment

1000
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,879
in the chat as well so well done guys

1001
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,919
um you know looking at where you were

1002
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,399
where you are now

1003
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:53,918
it's it's absolutely fantastic so um

1004
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:56,799
move on to the next question

1005
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:58,720
uh really quickly um is the data

1006
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,920
captured and reported any kind of tool

1007
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,200
do you use in your tooling

1008
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,359
i know there's a few questions around

1009
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,720
the dashboard so i think that

1010
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,240
you know if you can kind of maybe answer

1011
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,680
both both of those around tooling and

1012
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,680
dashboard and how it's created

1013
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,200
yeah so i can i can probably jump in and

1014
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,040
answer that one

1015
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,359
so the tool that we're currently using

1016
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,000
so all of the all that we demoed in in

1017
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,920
respect

1018
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,760
to the dashboards um so it's all created

1019
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,920
in splunk um

1020
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:25,280
so there's a tool of choice at present

1021
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,079
so um

1022
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,680
we're ingesting a variety of logs as a

1023
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:32,079
covered

1024
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,919
and we splunk is quite powerful and

1025
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,440
allows us to be quite

1026
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,119
flexible in terms of what we're doing so

1027
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,760
we've been able to be pretty creative

1028
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,200
and

1029
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,720
create some of those reports and

1030
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:43,520
dashboards that'll really help us answer

1031
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,520
some of those questions

1032
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,119
and uh yeah i guess just from an

1033
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,400
analysis and threat hunting point of

1034
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:50,960
view and just understanding what's

1035
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,400
what's happening so it's quite quite uh

1036
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,720
heavily utilized by the team at the

1037
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:57,760
moment

1038
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,598
fantastic um well that's it for time in

1039
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,839
terms of questions but there are plenty

1040
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:03,680
plenty more so you caps will hopefully

1041
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:04,560
be around for the next few hours and

1042
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:06,240

1043
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:10,160
