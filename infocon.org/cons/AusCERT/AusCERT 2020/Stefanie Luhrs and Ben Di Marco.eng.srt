we're very pleased to be speaking to you

43
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,400
today about this fascinating world of

44
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,079
data and privacy risk in this new age

45
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:34,079
that we find ourselves in

46
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,199
as most of you will know from a number

47
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,119
of headline events

48
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,119
in the last 12 months the data and

49
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,240
privacy risk landscape has changed

50
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,240
significantly

51
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,839
to put things in context this year alone

52
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,199
we have welcomed the introduction of the

53
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,560
consumer data right

54
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,560
we've seen height and regulatory

55
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,680
activity by both asic and the a

56
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,280
c the 2020 cyber security strategy was

57
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,040
released and we've seen some

58
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,040
high-profile breach events including

59
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,719
those against toll and also the attacks

60
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,200
against the australian government

61
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,759
uh significant reforms for the privacy

62
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,759
act

63
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,759
are now also underway so the train has

64
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,800
well and truly left the station

65
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,440
so now is the time to commence a review

66
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,440
of the truck

67
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,680
of the data and privacy related laws

68
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,680

security risks from an end-to-end

87
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,200
perspective

88
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,560

some of the risk management and

91
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,720
insurance solutions

92
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,799
thanks ben uh so before we delve in i'll

93
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,640
very briefly outline what it is that we

94
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,400
propose to run through today

95
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,559
uh firstly we'll take a look at the

96
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,680
existing regulatory landscape within

97
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,040
australia

98
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,640
then we'll dive into some key

99
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,159
legislative developments including the

100
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,760
consumer data right

101
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,599
some of the proposed changes to the

102
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,239
security of critical infrastructure act

103
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,200
as well as cps 234 that came into effect

104
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,480
last year

105
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,480
i will take a look at some of the

106
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,319
penalties and enforcement action

107
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:23,840
by each of the regulators in this space

108
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,319
including the oic

109
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,239
uh the acc and asic will highlight some

110
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,000
of the key class action activity

111
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,920
that we've seen to date and some of the

112
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,159
hurdles that have been faced by our

113
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,200
plaintiffs pursuing those actions

114
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,640
we'll take a look at the threat

115
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,238
landscape and some of some of the

116
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,559
incident response trends

117
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,720
over the last 12 months will look at the

118
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,560
consequences of this changed landscape

119
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,799
as well as some insurance dilemmas

120
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,720
and possible solutions and finally we'll

121
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,400
leave you with some tips for

122
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,480
how you can navigate this sea change and

123
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,599
what practical steps organizations can

124
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,599
implement to address them

125
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,200
so what does the australian landscape

126
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,920
look like currently

127
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,439
well i think that any crash course would

128
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,359
probably highlight that we have a

129
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,239
patchwork of data security laws so

130
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,959
there's no

131
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,560
specific overarching cyber security act

132
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,360
and the regulatory environment is made

133
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,040
up of

134
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,640
sector specific regulations and

135
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,560
guidelines including

136
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,039
financial and health regulations as well

137
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,959
as cyber crime and interception laws

138
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,520
to confuse things there's also a variety

139
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,199
of regulators and regulation tends to

140
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,120
differ between public and private

141
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,680
sectors and the types of enforcement

142
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,479
action

143
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,199
also tend to vary amongst regulators we

144
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,840
have

145
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,360
non-privacy regulators adopting a data

146
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,560
regulation approach

147
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,320
so the acc has been particularly active

148
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,680
and it's been successful in actions for

149
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,680
misuse of data

150
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,280
asic in the last few weeks it's it's

151
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,240
also commenced its first piece of

152
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,840
litigation

153
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,919
relating to the obligations of a

154
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,280
financial services provider to manage

155
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,120
cyber risk

156
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,799
there's currently no standard approach

157
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,919
to cyber security management

158
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,320
we have the federal government

159
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,039
information security manual and the nist

160
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,360
framework

161
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,120
for example but otherwise there is no

162
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,080
mandatory national standard for cyber

163
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,680
security

164
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,359
so with all that in mind it's not really

165
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,440
any surprise i think that there are

166
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,600
calls for a single regulatory authority

167
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,919
as well as a dedicated cyber minister

168
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,440
to help to harmonize regulation and

169
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:18,320
standards across both the private and

170
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,320
public sectors

171
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,960
the varied regulatory approach means

172
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,400
that we've seen quite a bit of activity

173
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,719
in the legislative and regular

174
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,320
regulatory space in the last 18 months

175
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,080
and following the introduction of the

176
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,960
notifiable data breaches scheme in

177
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,680
february

178
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,359
2018 so this uh gives you a quick

179
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,759
snapshot and we'll work through these a

180
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,560
little bit more but in july last year

181
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:42,479
we welcomed the introduction of cps234

182
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,280
that applies to opera regulated entities

183
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,520
and then we'll

184
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,239
talk to that a little bit more shortly

185
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,198
but cps234 now requires entities to

186
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,280
implement

187
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,919
certain controls and undertake regular

188
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,400
testing and also promptly notify

189
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,919
opera of any material information

190
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,159
security incident

191
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,000
the consumer data right uh that's a new

192
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,400
part of the competition and consumer act

193
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,639
commenced in the banking sector in july

194
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,159
and that will be rolled out uh economy

195
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,919
wide over time and the energy and

196
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,880
telecommunications sectors will be up

197
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,039
next

198
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,240
the 2020 cyber security strategy was

199
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,240
released in august

200
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,880
and that has highlighted some further uh

201
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,319
regulatory change is on the horizon

202
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,159
and that will include amendments to the

203
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,759
critical infrastructure act

204
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,120
that the government's trying to push out

205
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,120
i think by the end of this year

206
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,120
over to you ben thank you very much

207
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:35,440
stephanie so in terms of the cps

208
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,720
234 as has been mentioned this was a

209
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,719
prudential standard that was brought

210
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,560
into place by apra to

211
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,479
deal with financial institutions

212
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,160
deposit-taking institutions

213
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,840
insurance companies and superannuation

214
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:47,360
funds and while this

215
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,440
commenced last year we've now got to the

216
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,080
point where those operational provisions

217
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,000
have landed

218
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,919
and for many organizations are now

219
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,360
starting to deal with the real machinery

220
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,758
and the real impact of this

221
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,800
particular piece of standard and the

222
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,240
three things that we'll really quickly

223
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,840
focus on here is that

224
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,759
234 was something that was deliberately

225
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,520
designed to be risk principle based

226
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,199
the obligation in a nutshell is that you

227
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,919
need to have systems and processes that

228
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,759
are

229
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,198
commensurate and responsive to the

230
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,240
realistic risk that you face as an

231
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,000
organization

232
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,520
this has been a real challenge for lots

233
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and lots of different clients that we've

234
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,599
spoken to

235
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,240
and worked with and it highlights the

236
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,599
dynamic expectations of what apra have

237
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,680
the two other points i think are quite

238
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,800
interesting is that we do have some

239
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,000
transitional arrangements that are

240
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,000
currently in place for

241
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,360
organizations that outsource their

242
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,440
information security

243
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,720
and some of their data processing to

244
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,240
other organizations

245
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,000
and that's a real focus area for the

246
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,720
next six to 12 months as some of those

247
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,160
types of

248
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,720
contracts and arrangements renew and

249
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,280
expire and also with apra's expectation

250
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,520
that

251
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,638
those organizations essentially manage

252
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,719
their third parties

253
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,080
to ensure that the data and their key

254
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,319
systems are

255
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,840
protected in keeping with the standard

256
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,960
uh last two points i'll quickly mention

257
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,239
here is that we've had a lot of

258
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,400
statements from apra

259
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,840
including from their executive member

260
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,440
greg summerhayes

261
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,960
focusing on the fact that organizations

262
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,560
need to understand their data

263
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,239
they think cyber resilience is a key

264
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,759
issue and also that they're

265
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,000
acutely aware of the fact that many

266
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,680
organizations that they regulate

267
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
are experiencing significant data

268
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,120
threats and this is also reflected in

269
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,639
the corporate plan which again

270
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,319
highlights the need for

271
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,919
cyber resiliency and that they will

272
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,199
continue to work with other regulators

273
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,359
to promote this across

274
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,199
the financial services network and we'll

275
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,680
have an increasingly compliance focus in

276
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,680
this area

277
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,039
thanks ben uh so the consumer data right

278
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,039
is a pretty big shake-up for

279
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,679
australia's data regulatory framework uh

280
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,240
the cdr is a complex statutory regime

281
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,559
but

282
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,959
it is basically just data portability

283
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,718
reform that enables consumers to

284
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:45,040
request that organizations share their

285
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,680
data to third parties via an online

286
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,279
system

287
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,160
and where that third party is an

288
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,560
accredited provider under the cdr regime

289
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,399
previously we had no right to data

290
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,800
portability like there is in the eu

291
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,519
so its introduction here is is a novel

292
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,760
development

293
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,440
and the intention behind it is to boost

294
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,439
competition and to improve

295
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,839
our consumers choice and control over

296
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,160
the data although regime is is quite

297
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:09,519
complex so i'll draw your attention to

298
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:12,000
just a few things that i think you

299
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:13,680
should be aware of the first is the

300
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
consumer data rules so the rules

301
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,920
currently set out the framework for

302
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,240
how the cdr operates in the banking

303
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,920
sector but the rules are intended to be

304
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,839
a living breathing document that will

305
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,560
change over time as things develop and

306
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,800
the cdr

307
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,319
expands into different sectors but the

308
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,359
key things to take note of in the

309
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,920
existing rules

310
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,680
is a process for consumer data requests

311
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,000
as well as a rules around

312
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,079
accreditation and so the rules set out

313
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,560
the process and the requirements for

314
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,720
applying to become an accredited person

315
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,560
and also their ongoing obligations so in

316
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,880
the banking sector for example

317
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,760
an accredited person could be a bank or

318
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,680
a fintech

319
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,760
uh that wishes to provide a good or

320
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,920
service using cdr data

321
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,600
cdr data in the banking sector currently

322
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,399
includes things like

323
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,320
transaction data or customer data and

324
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:02,800
customers account data

325
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,600
at the end of august the acc had

326
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,160
received five

327
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,240
applications for accreditation i think

328
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,920
which are still under assessment

329
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,480
but there are 20 more applications

330
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,479
currently in development

331
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:17,519
the consumer data right is accompanied

332
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:19,040
by privacy safeguards that set out how

333
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,640
privacy will be protected and how

334
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,279
confidential data

335
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,120
will be dealt with under the regime so

336
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,040
the privacy safeguards are

337
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,120
similar to the australian privacy

338
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,199
principles that accompany the privacy

339
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,000
act but they are broader in scope

340
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,920
and much more onerous in some cases so

341
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,680
just because a business may be complying

342
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,439
with the australian privacy principles

343
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,920
doesn't mean that it will be compliant

344
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,279
with the cdr privacy safeguards

345
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,360
and that's because the privacy

346
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,200
safeguards actually cover a broader

347
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,000
range of data than the definition of

348
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,000
personal

349
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,519
information under the privacy act and

350
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,160
they also require things like

351
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,480
express consent from consumers for the

352
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,560
collection and the use of the cdr data

353
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,079
as well as a requirement to keep written

354
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,560
records of any disclosure

355
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,479
in response to a request another thing

356
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,880
to note is that the privacy safeguards

357
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:08,079
will

358
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:10,000
actually be enforced under the

359
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,319
competition and consumer act which has a

360
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,480
much more extensive penalty regime

361
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:16,399
than what's currently available for any

362
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,040
non-compliance of the australian privacy

363
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,480
principles under the privacy act so

364
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,399
uh in addition cdr consumers will also

365
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,320
have a direct right of action

366
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,440
for breaches of the privacy safeguards

367
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,040
against those

368
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,360
that are responsible and that doesn't

369
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,519
appear under the privacy act

370
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,360
so any businesses that are participating

371
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,800
in the cdr regime will really need to

372
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,560
give some thought to

373
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,079
how the australian privacy principles

374
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,719
and the privacy safeguards will interact

375
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:47,040
the cdr is also accompanied by technical

376
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,000
data standards that specify how

377
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,599
cdr data is to be shared via apis with

378
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,040
organizations accredited

379
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,639
by the a c so data 61 which is part of

380
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,959
the government's csiro

381
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,800
uh performs the role of the data

382
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:03,359
standards body under the cdr

383
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:04,479
and they've developed those standards

384
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,880
the acc

385
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,120
is the lead regulator for the scheme but

386
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,240
they're supported by the oic

387
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,480
and as part of the roll out of the cdr

388
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,440
both of the regulators have jointly

389
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,760
published a

390
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,440
compliance and enforcement policy which

391
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,200
outlines the approach that they'll take

392
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,360
to ensure compliance

393
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,680
and the policy actually calls out

394
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,079
certain types of misconduct that will

395
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,920
always attract enforcement

396
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,560
considerations so that includes things

397
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,839
like

398
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,399
refusing to disclose cdr data

399
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:38,079
collecting cdr data without consent

400
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,800
engaging in misleading or deceptive

401
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:44,479
conduct and failing to implement

402
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,479
appropriate security controls

403
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:52,079
so without detracting from i think what

404
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,920
is really a watershed development in

405
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,319
australia's privacy regime

406
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,959
it's probably no surprise that industry

407
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,839
has a

408
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,239
has a few concerns with the cdr and its

409
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,880
operations so some of the key tensions

410
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,000
highlighted to date include the data

411
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,560
security issues with

412
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,680
transferring cdr data to a less secure

413
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,760
platform so

414
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:13,760
the concern here is that uh an

415
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,639
accredited person like a bank

416
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,120
uh may be required to transfer its cdr

417
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,680
data

418
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,760
from what is a relatively high secure

419
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,680
environment to a less secure platform if

420
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,200
it receives a request from a consumer to

421
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,599
transfer data to

422
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,959
a comparison site for example or a small

423
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,720
fintech or broker

424
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,040
that may not have the same levels of

425
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,639
cyber security that a bank

426
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:36,560
spending hundreds of millions of dollars

427
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,440
a year might have

428
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,239
write access is also uh very topical so

429
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,040
currently

430
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,160
the cdr only allows uh third parties to

431
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,800
access data

432
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,600
from banks on a read-only basis um but

433
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,599
there's an attempt

434
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,839
an intention to implement right access

435
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,079
which could allow a third party to

436
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,920
change or to add data about a consumer

437
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,719
and potentially allow third parties to

438
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,040
do things like

439
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,199
open and close accounts uh with consumer

440
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,160
consent so the bank's concern with that

441
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:06,160
is that it will turn comparison sites

442
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,199
into facilitators and could potentially

443
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,480
allow

444
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:12,800
users to apply for a financial product

445
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:15,519
from the comparison site rather than

446
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,399
from the bank directly

447
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,320
despite competition being the key policy

448
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,959
reason for implementing the cdr

449
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,480
in the banking sector some sectors argue

450
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,800
that it will only have incremental

451
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,839
benefits to competition so some telcos

452
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,399
are arguing that

453
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,600
they just don't suffer the same lack of

454
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,240
customer switching

455
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,920
that you may see in banking and that any

456
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,399
benefits to competition

457
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:39,920
in those sectors will only be marginal

458
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,040
high implementation and ongoing

459
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,880
compliance costs

460
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,959
is another key concern particularly in

461
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,959
the current economic climate

462
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,880
the energy and telcro sectors are up

463
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,518
next and they've voiced those

464
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:52,160
those concerns the implementation of the

465
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,279
regime

466
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,279
uh imposes various compliance costs

467
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,519
for businesses including developing new

468
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,519
systems and technologies and

469
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,440
the ongoing costs of complying with

470
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:05,199
consumer requests as well

471
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,639
so the costs are really additional costs

472
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,000
that many businesses are going to have

473
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,160
to absorb

474
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,839
which is it is going to be difficult in

475
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,839
this economic climate

476
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,399
no doubt you'll be aware of the release

477
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,079
of the 2020 cyber security strategy and

478
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,079
i won't spend too much time on this but

479
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,160
just to briefly summarize there's

480
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,279
obviously a clear focus on critical

481
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,959
infrastructure

482
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,720
the government has flagged its intention

483
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,839
to expand the coverage

484
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,600
of the security of critical

485
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:33,360
infrastructure act to other sectors like

486
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,759
healthcare and education

487
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,959
and to also specify minimum expectations

488
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,639
and obligations for critical

489
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,479
infrastructure entities

490
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,320
the strategy also suggests that there'll

491
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,800
be some legislative reform

492
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,360
that will place additional obligations

493
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,040
on

494
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,519
our company directors in respect of

495
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:51,040
cyber security there's no further detail

496
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:53,120
around that just yet but we could

497
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,759
possibly see something similar to

498
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,800
apra cps234 that includes express

499
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,399
provisions

500
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,399
relating to the board's management of

501
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:02,720
information security

502
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,959
a key deliverable under the strategy was

503
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:07,040
the voluntary code of practice for

504
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:08,719
internet of things and that was released

505
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,880
on the 3rd of september

506
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,839
the code is based on 13 principles and

507
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,480
it largely

508
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:15,279
mirrors the draft code but it recommends

509
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,360
the things like

510
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,519
the use of things like mfa and

511
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,800
appropriate identity verification as

512
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:23,360
well as logging

513
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,639
remote access i think we're still a

514
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,079
little bit behind the ball

515
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,240
internationally when it comes to that

516
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,479
code the uk has had a similar code in

517
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,560
effect for about two years now and it's

518
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:36,000
now looking to move to mandatory

519
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,599
security and its iot products the

520
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,759
australian government will also work

521
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,680
with businesses to consider legislative

522
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,240
changes that set a minimum

523
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,079
cyber security baseline across the

524
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,639
entire economy so

525
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,199
the strategy doesn't yet specify exactly

526
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,120
what

527
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,399
those legislative changes will be but

528
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,079
it's suggested that

529
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,759
there'll be changes to privacy and data

530
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,199
protection laws as well as duties for

531
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,000
company directors like i mentioned

532
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,758
earlier

533
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,360
and finally the strategy looks to better

534
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,839
assist smes by

535
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,959
uplifting their cyber security

536
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:07,280
capabilities the government intends to

537
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,959
provide smes with with bundles of secure

538
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,399
services that includes things like

539
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,959
awareness training and

540
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,120
and threat blocking they also intend to

541
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:18,559
expand their 24 7 hotline

542
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:22,399
out to smes

543
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:24,399
thank you so uh just uh continuing uh

544
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,079
with the next topic steph has already

545
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,880
mentioned that we've had some

546
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:30,240
focus around the critical infrastructure

547
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,280
space both in the cyber security

548
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,480
strategy

549
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:36,639
and one of those areas of focus is

550
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,400
also in terms of having amendments to

551
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,840
the existing critical infrastructure act

552
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,600
of 2018

553
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,520
this act in its initial guise was really

554
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,120
about identifying who owned critical

555
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:48,000
infrastructure assets

556
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,639
encouraging information sharing and also

557
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,240
promoting

558
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,480
some form of resilience where we had

559
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,600
events the three areas that the

560
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,640
australian government has indicated

561
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,320
they're looking to amend and that

562
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,320
they're looking to strengthen

563
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,760
firstly in terms of creating positive

564
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,918
security obligations

565
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,520
which can have both a cyber focus and a

566
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,360
non-cyber focus

567
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,720
so in terms of these positive security

568
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,760
obligations these are

569
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,679
both designing sector-specific responses

570
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:13,200
approaches to physical security

571
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,679
approaches to training

572
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,200
and in terms of specific cyber security

573
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,720
obligations the key thing that's been

574
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,160
mentioned here is that

575
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,280
for many of these organizations they

576
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,640
need to get better in terms of

577
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,918
developing playbooks

578
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,760
they need to do more of what the

579
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,720
government is calling cyber security

580
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:29,120
exercises

581
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,480
so whether that's internal examinations

582
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,879
external audits

583
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,640
certain types of scenarios or tabletops

584
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,720
and also that they want there to be a

585
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,400
much more proactive approach in terms of

586
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:39,919
how these organizations understand these

587
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,000
obligations and also

588
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:43,039
the role of boards and senior management

589
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,960
and the third thing that they're looking

590
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,559
to amend is government assistance so

591
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,600
essentially making it so that

592
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,879
organizations will be able to

593
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
communicate more effectively with

594
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,120
government

595
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,959
and also allow government to become

596
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,479
involved and to provide assistance

597
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,240
where there's a very significant cyber

598
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,520
threat or alternatively where there's

599
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,640
some type of

600
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:03,200
cyber incident or some type of cyber

601
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:04,559
concern which may have a wider sovereign

602
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:10,240
or economy

603
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:12,320
impact thanks ben

604
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,240
so as to the types of penalties and

605
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,639
enforcement action in the last 12 months

606
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,000
uh

607
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,080
we've seen the a triple c be

608
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,640
particularly active it was recently

609
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,960
successful in securing a 2.9 million

610
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,039
fine after the federal court found that

611
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,160
health engine which is a gp booking

612
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,559
platform

613
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,080
had engaged in misleading conduct by

614
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,879
sharing the personal information of

615
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,039
patients

616
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,440
with private health insurance brokers

617
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:37,280
the acc has also commenced two sets of

618
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,440
proceedings against google

619
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:41,120
in late 2019 it commenced an action

620
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,720
against google claiming that

621
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,639
it misled consumers about the

622
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,440
circumstances in which their location

623
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,440
data

624
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,760
is collected and and how to opt out of

625
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,840
that um that hearing scheduled for

626
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,520
november this year and google said

627
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,399
publicly that it will defend those

628
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,480
claims

629
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,720
the most recent action against google uh

630
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:00,640
alleges that it misled consumers by

631
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,960
failing to adequately disclose uh

632
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:06,480
changes to its privacy policies

633
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,559
and uh the way a way about those

634
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,919
that personal data is collected and used

635
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,399
but that's still in its very early

636
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:14,000
stages at this point

637
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,240
asic recently commenced litigation

638
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
against ri advice which is a financial

639
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,799
services company alleging

640
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,400
deficient cyber security practices asic

641
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,720
claims that ri

642
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,480
breached its afs license conditions and

643
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,600
failed to discharge its duties and

644
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,520
functions by

645
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,360
failing to implement adequate systems

646
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:33,440
resources and policies

647
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:36,158
and although asics had a heightened

648
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,840
focus on cyber security in recent years

649
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,600
this is actually the first time that

650
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,559
asic has commenced legal proceedings

651
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,199
alleging

652
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,960
deficient cyber practices so asic has

653
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,320
indicated in the past that managing

654
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:48,799
cyber security risks

655
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,039
falls within the realm of general

656
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,918
director's duties but in this case

657
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:55,440
asic's claim against ri advice actually

658
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,360
alleges contravention

659
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,600
of its obligations as an australian

660
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,918
financial services licence holder

661
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,959
as opposed to a breach of its directors

662
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,960
duties

663
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,039
so the ri litigation i think is a shift

664
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,679
from asic's focus from just

665
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,200
education to real enforcement and it's

666
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,679
sending a strong message that

667
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,159
that asic is taking our deficiencies in

668
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:18,080
cyber security very seriously

669
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,919
we haven't yet seen any enforcement

670
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,760
activity by opera for non-compliance

671
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,960
with cps234

672
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:27,039
but the oisc has recently commenced a

673
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,039
joint investigation with the uk

674
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:32,158
information commissioner to invest

675
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,840
clearview ai's privacy practices

676
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,679
you probably heard about this matter

677
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,280
clearview is a technology company that

678
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:39,600
allows a user to take

679
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,760
a picture of a person upload it and then

680
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,158
identify publicly available photos of

681
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,879
the

682
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,559
individual and it sources available

683
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,840
photos from things like facebook and

684
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,840
youtube

685
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,600
the oic has stated that it won't comment

686
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,678
on that investigation so we don't yet

687
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,918
know yet if it will lead to enforcement

688
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:58,000
action but i think it seems likely

689
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,520
the osc's attention has otherwise been

690
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,919
focused on its

691
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,000
landmark litigation against facebook

692
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:06,400
arising from the cambridge analytica

693
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,400
scandal

694
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,559
so the case against facebook is

695
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,000
particularly significant i'm sure most

696
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,559
of the audience will be familiar

697
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,159
with the cambridge analytica scandal

698
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,240
that relates to the harvesting of

699
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:20,320
personal data of facebook users

700
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,720
by an app which was then unsold to

701
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,760
cambridge analytica who used that data

702
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,720
to produce a targeted political campaign

703
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:30,559
only a small number of australians uh 53

704
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,720
according to the oic

705
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,600
actually installed the app but the app

706
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,919
was able to

707
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,439
obtain the personal information of a

708
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,120
further 311

709
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,039
000 australians who were friends of the

710
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:44,158
53 users so

711
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:46,720
the oic's key issue with this is that

712
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,440
facebook's privacy settings were so

713
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:52,159
opaque that the processes for changing

714
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,520
them were so complicated that most users

715
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,840
wouldn't have realized that the app

716
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,918
could access their data by default

717
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,520
facebook hasn't actually been able to

718
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,120
precisely state

719
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,720
the personal information that was

720
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,479
accessed

721
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,159
by the app and it's also not known if

722
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,000
any other third parties access the

723
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:10,400
information so there are a few reasons

724
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,840
why these proceedings are particularly

725
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,919
interesting

726
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:15,600
firstly there's a question as to whether

727
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,360
information can be

728
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,678
personal information within the meaning

729
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,000
of the privacy act if the identity of

730
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:22,960
the

731
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,080
individuals whose privacy has allegedly

732
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,400
been interfered with

733
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,199
isn't known to anyone because the

734
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,960
commissioner

735
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,720
isn't able to identify with any

736
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,720
provision precision

737
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,159
are the identities of all the australian

738
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,880
individuals and the particular

739
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,600
information

740
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:39,520
allegedly collected and held about them

741
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,918
it's possible that the court could

742
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:44,720
could conclude that the information is

743
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:46,880
not in fact personal information

744
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,559
secondly it involves overseas companies

745
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,720
so the court will have to consider

746
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:53,440
whether the privacy act applies

747
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,159
extra territorially which will set an

748
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,840
important

749
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,080
precedent for businesses that operate

750
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:01,039
from offshore and thirdly

751
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,879
the oic is seeking a penalty for each

752
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,600
disclosure of personal information by

753
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,360
facebook

754
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,360
which constituted an interference of

755
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,080
privacy and that will have a major

756
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:12,559
impact on the maximum penalty available

757
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:15,120
if each person affected is said to have

758
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:18,639
had their privacy interfered with

759
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,120
then there could argue arguably be 311

760
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,760
000

761
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,080
instances of an interference of privacy

762
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,240
to consider in formulating a penalty

763
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,559
and if that's accepted by the court

764
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:30,320
facebook could be potentially liable to

765
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:31,840
an extremely large penalty

766
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,678
are the maximum penalty for a

767
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:37,199
contravention at the time was

768
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,720
1.7 million dollars so instead of a 1.7

769
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,520
million dollar fine for a single

770
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,000
interference

771
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,240
the penalty could potentially be as high

772
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,480
as 500 billion dollars so

773
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,159
the determination as to whether uh the

774
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,600
disclosure by facebook

775
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:54,320
is a multiple or a single interference

776
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:56,240
uh with uh the privacy of an individual

777
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,918
is going to set an important precedent

778
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,760
for calculating the quantum of future

779
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:04,159
penalties under the privacy act

780
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,600
okay thank you very much stephanie i've

781
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,120
seen our just question that we've had

782
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,719
pop up in the chat room and yes we will

783
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,320
be making these slides available

784
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,600
uh also uh steph and i have taken the

785
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,960
typical lawyers approach where we've

786
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,719
probably given you enough content for

787
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,640
two sessions so i'm going to cover a

788
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:17,919
couple of my slides very very quickly

789
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,159
because we really want to have questions

790
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:21,840
and some discussions with you at the end

791
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:23,600
the next slide that we're going to is

792
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,879
accb health engine

793
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,719
i'm sure a lot of people are aware of

794
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,640
this this is a

795
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,480
piece of litigation that was filed by

796
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,640
our competition regulator

797
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,600
and what it focused on was misleading

798
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,600
deceptive conduct

799
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,719
by health engine in terms of how it was

800
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,120
using patient data

801
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,480
how it was communicating referral data

802
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,158
and also the way in which it was sharing

803
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,679
it with third parties

804
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,960
there has now been a fine that's been

805
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,720
entered and it's been accepted by the

806
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,760
court for 2.9 million

807
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:50,080
there's two things that are very

808
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,760
significant here firstly this fine also

809
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,039
has reference to the benefit that health

810
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,480
engine obtained

811
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,240
as a result of its conduct that

812
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,679
infringed the act and specifically it

813
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,360
incorporates the amount of referral

814
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,039
revenue that was obtained

815
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,719
and also the way in which the data was

816
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,480
used financially within the business and

817
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,159
within the organization

818
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,760
secondly as well what we're also seeing

819
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,440
is that we're now seeing different

820
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,120
regulators coming to play

821
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,559
by having these different regulators the

822
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,520
types of risks that the organizations

823
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,520
have to think about

824
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,799
is changing and also we have to think

825
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,000
about as well all of the public

826
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,360
statements and all of the different

827
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,039
things that we say about

828
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,799
how we're using data and how we're using

829
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,279
information systems

830
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:27,440
i think this one's your steph thanks ben

831
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,640
uh so as to data breach class actions i

832
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,400
think the tide is turning but

833
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,240
organizations still face

834
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,400
a number of hurdles and to date we've

835
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,240
only seen one data breach class action

836
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,200
receive any judicial commentary before

837
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,960
the courts

838
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,840
that case involved a class action that

839
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,880
was commenced by 130 ambulance employees

840
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,840
against the

841
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,039
new south wales ambulance service after

842
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:50,080
employees workers

843
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:52,480
compensation files were sold to personal

844
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,960
injury law firms by a contractor

845
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,559
the case was settled and it was brought

846
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,880
before the courts to determine if the

847
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,720
settlement was fair and reasonable so

848
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,200
there's still no judicial commentary

849
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,720
around the legal causes of action

850
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,240
and that can be pursued for a data

851
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,960
breach class action

852
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,960
the key difficulty in australia is that

853
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,559
there is no statutory right to make a

854
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,240
claim for breach of privacy

855
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,158
and there's no tort of privacy under the

856
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,000
common law either there's also some

857
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:20,080
difficulties with quantifying the lost

858
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,080
claim for data breach class actions so

859
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,760
the problem is that claims by

860
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,600
affected individuals are often for

861
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,080
distress or embarrassment

862
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:29,520
and not actual financial loss where

863
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:30,559
there's been unauthorized access to

864
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,879
personal information

865
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,158
so the calculation of that loss or even

866
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,399
the potential value

867
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:37,600
of the data is particularly difficult to

868
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:40,080
quantify and there's no

869
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:42,320
agreed method and in some cases it may

870
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,080
be relatively straightforward

871
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,439
if there's been direct financial loss

872
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,760
from something like a fraudulent

873
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,000
transfer of funds but in most cases it's

874
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,600
not

875
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,159
clear-cut and there's no australian

876
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,158
precedent

877
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,919
great thank you steph uh so again

878
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,639
mindful we want to have some questions i

879
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,399
am going to

880
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,000
burn through these next few slides we

881
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,039
wanted to give the audience an idea of

882
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,120
what we were seeing in the threat

883
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,640
landscape and what i've put up here is

884
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,158
five points that we're consistently

885
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:08,080
chatting about with our clients and that

886
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:09,919
we're finding clients are grappling with

887
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,678
uh two things i'll quickly focus on here

888
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,279
is we do think incident response is

889
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,480
changing and in this post covered

890
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,919
landscape that we're in

891
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,760
we're seeing a lot of clients facing

892
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:19,440
difficulties in terms of how they

893
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,480
coordinate themselves internally how

894
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,000
they get

895
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,000
the right vendors and how they onboard

896
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,600
the right vendors quickly and also how

897
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,880
they manage the communications and

898
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,320
manage stakeholders

899
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,640
when we go through the incident response

900
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,320
process a second one that i'll focus on

901
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,679
is what's happening in the extortion and

902
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,279
ransomware space

903
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,200
we're seeing a lot of organizations both

904
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,080
hearing globally facing increasing

905
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,600
ransoms

906
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,879
i can tell you from our experience we're

907
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,840
aware of multiple that have happened in

908
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,279
the last few months

909
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,279
where the ransom amounts have been 5

910
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:46,720
million plus we're also seeing very

911
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,159
different forms of extortion so

912
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,480
extortions that focus

913
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:52,000
not so much on allowing you access to

914
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:53,600
data to restore systems

915
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,679
but rather the publication of sensitive

916
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,199
data if you don't pay or alternatively

917
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,799
that sensitive documents or sensitive

918
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,200
information that's been harvested from

919
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,879
you

920
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,480
will be misused in a way that causes

921
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,080
damage

922
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,399
so the next thing we really wanted to

923
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,840
talk about was landmark white and

924
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,120
i'm sure many people here have looked at

925
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,559
the case studies they're relatively

926
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,120
aware of what's happened with landmark

927
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,480
white

928
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,479
but the thing that we think is very very

929
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,840
interesting is landmark white is a

930
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,360
matter where obviously there was an

931
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,279
immediate impact to the business

932
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,719
uh when it had a cyber event uh the

933
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,919
banks that it worked with suspended it

934
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,520
from their panels and there was a

935
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,120
significant financial loss

936
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:27,440
but there's also been a very long term

937
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,799
shareholder loss and a very long term

938
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,720
business reputation and business

939
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:32,320
interruption loss we're showing you a

940
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,320
slide that tracks what the landmark

941
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,918
white share price did in the 12 months

942
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,678
following the data breach and the public

943
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,200
announcement of the data breach

944
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:40,799
and you'll see that there are a series

945
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,159
of significant drop-offs

946
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,000
that relate to negative events that the

947
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,520
company sustained but even more

948
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,799
interestingly if you track it through to

949
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,559
the next 12 months and

950
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,080
the period where we currently are that

951
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,520
share price hasn't really recovered and

952
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,639
it hasn't really rebounded

953
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,158
and i think this is one of the things

954
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,559
we've also got to think about in terms

955
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,480
of

956
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,480
how the landscape is changing that we

957
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,159
now have evidence that significant cyber

958
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,240
events have very long-term risks

959
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,600
they have huge reputational impacts and

960
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,799
we have to have a very end-to-end

961
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,840
approach in terms of

962
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,080
how we manage them and how we deal with

963
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,678
resilience

964
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,439
in terms of some of the consequences of

965
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,960
the change landscape we do think that

966
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:14,320
there's now a very strong connection

967
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,559
between cyber events

968
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,720
and bi and financial loss we're seeing

969
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:20,158
now organizations have less redundancies

970
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,600
we're seeing a huge technology

971
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,720
dependency for anything that's revenue

972
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,080
generating

973
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,679
we're also seeing for our clients the

974
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,799
need to go beyond personal information

975
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,159
and pii

976
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,279
for a lot of our clients it's really

977
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,240
about what's happening with their

978
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,240
corporate data

979
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,919
the data that the systems rely on and

980
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:36,159
also what's the type of data that is

981
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,279
really the crown jewel assets

982
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,279
two other things i'll very quickly

983
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,120
mention here is that we are seeing a

984
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:43,200
strong focus in terms of organizations

985
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,479
that sustain significant data breaches

986
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,240
thinking about what they can do to

987
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,880
maximize financial recovery

988
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,640
this can be both through insurance which

989
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,640
hopefully is robust and has been

990
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,480
comprehensively designed but also

991
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,679
potential legal recourses so against

992
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,200
service providers

993
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,279
against supply chain partners who might

994
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,360
have caused the breach and finally we're

995
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:02,960
also seeing a real focus now on

996
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,879
understanding that each organization has

997
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,159
pretty unique risks even across

998
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,519
industries the tolerances will be

999
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,159
different the key drivers will be

1000
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:09,600
different

1001
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,840
and we've got to really think about that

1002
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,799
first point of how is data being used

1003
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,720
and how are systems being used

1004
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,158
insurance solutions i just want to cover

1005
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,279
this very very quickly but

1006
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:20,480
we are finding for a lot of

1007
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,760
organizations they have to really

1008
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,640
carefully look at their insurance at the

1009
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,480
moment

1010
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,399
it's really critical that you have uh

1011
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:27,120
affirmative cyber insurance policy or

1012
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,879
product

1013
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,719
the market is essentially taking out

1014
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,600
covers from traditional insurances so

1015
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,799
property

1016
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,080
isr public liability kidnap and ransom

1017
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:38,080
and there are a number of new cyber

1018
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,960
exclusions that are coming in part of

1019
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,559
this is because

1020
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,240
that the insurers have realized that

1021
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,918
this is a casualty risk the amount of

1022
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,600
losses now are very very high

1023
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,120
we have multiple examples of incidents

1024
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,279
where there's multiple millions

1025
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,799
in some cases 10 20 hundreds of millions

1026
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:52,480
following cyber events

1027
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:54,399
and finally by extension we need to have

1028
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:56,000
a really robust discussion with clients

1029
00:31:54,399 --> 00:31:57,840
to make sure that we tailor insurance to

1030
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,720
what they need

1031
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,480
so we're coming to at the end and just

1032
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,640
in terms of things that you can do

1033
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,159
we think that there's a good reason now

1034
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,039
to be focusing on data governance

1035
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,960
processes

1036
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:10,879
what we're doing from cradle to grave

1037
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,720
but also making sure that in addition to

1038
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,080
understanding systems and having

1039
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,080
policies that are done by the

1040
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,559
information security people or by people

1041
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,158
that

1042
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:19,600
aren't the coal face that there's that

1043
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:20,799
wider governance support so whether

1044
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,000
that's through internal committees

1045
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,360
whether that's to the board

1046
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,840
and that whole governance picture is

1047
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,439
becoming a huge focus of regulators

1048
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,360
we also think that the regulatory risk

1049
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,120
is changing so organizations need to

1050
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:32,399
assess this they need to think about it

1051
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,840
and we're seeing very significant

1052
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,399
changes in the contractual risk space

1053
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,678
too

1054
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,000
both in terms of assumptions of

1055
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,200
liability limitations and affirmative

1056
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,559
obligations

1057
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,080
for policies and frameworks we're

1058
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,200
finding many organizations are having to

1059
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,240
review these carefully

1060
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,080
and even if you had something that

1061
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,279
worked pre-covered we're finding with

1062
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,240
our clients that they actually don't

1063
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,440
work very well in the current

1064
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,880
environment

1065
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,120
finally obviously collaboration

1066
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:54,640
information sharing is a huge focus for

1067
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,600
the government and also i think will be

1068
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:58,000
very important

1069
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,840
for industries and organizations and

1070
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,519
insurance and resilience strategies

1071
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,279
one of the most common things we're

1072
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:04,399
seeing is an acceptance by organizations

1073
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,279
that they will have a number of data

1074
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,799
breaches

1075
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,919
so we need to make sure that there's a

1076
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:08,879
recovery aspect and that the

1077
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,600
organization

1078
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:12,480
can be as resilient as possible that's

1079
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,799
all from me

1080
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:16,399
uh so we're very happy to take questions

1081
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,760
you can either raise your hand and throw

1082
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,600
things at us or

1083
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,120
if you want to just put some things in

1084
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,719
the chat and

1085
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,840
steph and i will just address them as

1086
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,840
they come through

1087
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,039
vladimir you're just on mute sorry my

1088
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,320
apologies there's a couple quick

1089
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:53,600
in the q a if you'd like to try and

1090
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:55,120
address those far away

1091
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,879
okay so we've just started seeing the

1092
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,399
questions so do you know if some

1093
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,320
universities will be more or

1094
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,239
impacted by critical infrastructure such

1095
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,840
as those that tie to the defence force

1096
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,080
uh two things i can say there is there

1097
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,360
will be some impacts because

1098
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,960
the way the government is talking about

1099
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,799
the critical infrastructure legislation

1100
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,320
it will extend to third parties

1101
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,000
and it will extend to the various

1102
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,560
suppliers and organizations that work

1103
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,560
with

1104
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,239
a critical infrastructure provider so we

1105
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,440
do expect there to be that expanded

1106
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,479
effect in that type of

1107
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,320
ripple effect we've seen

1108
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,159
another question that's come through do

1109
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:28,240
you anticipate the acc will extend the

1110
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,679
cdr to effectively ensource

1111
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:31,359
strong separation of back-end and

1112
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,800
front-end services

1113
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:36,078
eg consumer operations under adr and

1114
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,520
similar requirements

1115
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,280
uh did you want to have a first crack at

1116
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,480
that smith i think it's it's pretty hard

1117
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,240
to know at this stage i think it's still

1118
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:45,040
very early days and that the

1119
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:46,078
age at the acc is still trying to work

1120
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,599
through with the banks

1121
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,839
uh the current operation under that

1122
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,240
scheme so i think watch that space and

1123
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,520
um

1124
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,520
you'll probably see a little bit more

1125
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,359
activity in the next few months i think

1126
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,800
as things start playing out

1127
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,560
yeah the only thing i would add is if

1128
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,160
you look at how the acc is right there

1129
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,320
triple c typically behaves

1130
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,839
um it's can be sometimes a bit of a

1131
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,880
blunt instrument so i think when it

1132
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,000
decides what

1133
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,200
the framework is and what the

1134
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,160
obligations are they're probably going

1135
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,319
to be applied

1136
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:11,520
quite quite uniformly and i'm not sure

1137
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,720
if you're going to see distinctions or

1138
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,839
lower standards

1139
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,240
uh being implemented in an ad hoc

1140
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:20,799
fashion

1141
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,799
do we have any other questions comments

1142
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,160
well i guess uh just in terms of um a

1143
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,680
closing comment from me

1144
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,359
thank you obviously everyone who's uh

1145
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,759
been uh involved and listened to this

1146
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,119
talk

1147
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,480
uh obviously there's a lot of material

1148
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,760
in the slides which is very very dense

1149
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,880
we'll be sharing this with you

1150
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,960
but if you have any other things that

1151
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:44,240
you don't understand or questions please

1152
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,480
feel free to reach out to stephanie and

1153
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,319

either by email or in chat we're always

1155
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,480
very happy to share information and have

1156
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:52,879
a chat with people on issues that are of

1157
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:54,480
interest to them

1158
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:56,240
great thanks uh ben and stephanie that

1159
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,359
was quite informative updating us on

1160
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,839
what's going on in australia at the

1161
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,839
moment
