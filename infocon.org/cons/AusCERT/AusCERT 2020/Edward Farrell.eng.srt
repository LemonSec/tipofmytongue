virtually with him

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,960
this year so ed's a security consultant

19
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,079
with you know 10 years experience and 15

20
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,480
years in tech so

21
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,760
an incredible amount of experience he's

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,038

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,559
long time is

24
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,760
a frequent at all cert and he's

25
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:03,440
one of the few remaining directors

26
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,759
that are running their own independent

27
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,240
security practices these days

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,240
mercury iss he has conducted and

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,759
overseen the delivery of over 300

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,320
security assessments

31
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,000
incident responses and you know

32
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,158
everything in the past five years

33
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
his professional highlights include

34
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,600
lecturing at the australian defense

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,720
force academy

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,280
being rated the top 200 bug bounty

37
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,119
hunters of 2015 very well done

38
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,560
and running an awesome team of security

39
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,320
professionals

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,479
um so his talk we're actually chatting

41
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,559
about it yesterday is i'm really really

42
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,400
looking forward to this one because

43
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,240
as we were kind of discussing yesterday

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,240
it's um it's something that comes up

45
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,119
quite often on the offensive side

46
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,759
so monitoring the monitors a path to

47
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,079
keeping

48
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,200
the sock in check so i'll kick it over

49
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,720
to ed

50
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,399
if you could kindly share your screen

51
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,399
with the slides there mate

52
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,920
and without further ado mr edward

53

yep sweet all right well g'day folks uh

63
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,400
and

64
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,400
welcome to my talk monitoring the

65
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,120
monitors a path to keeping the stock in

66
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,360
check

67
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,959
uh so my name is edward farrell i've now

68
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,720
been doing pen testing for about 10

69
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,760
years running my own team for the last

70
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,400
five

71
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,879
um so funnily enough my career started

72
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,200
off

73
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,959
um in a network operations center before

74
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,599
security was the big thing

75
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,519
uh focusing on security and then

76
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,879
evolving into the offensive side after

77
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,120
that

78
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,399
um so the last five years i've been

79
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,120
running my own team

80
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,959
uh and we do a couple of different

81
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,680
assessments uh and this has kind of been

82
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,319
an

83
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,640
evolving thing for us over the last uh

84
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,000
probably the last 12 months of

85
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:58,480
looking at socks that are now all the

86
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,519
the rage um how do we actually get them

87
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,440
working in

88
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,720
and functioning properly or even holding

89
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,840
them to account so

90
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,920
a little bit of what we'll be going

91
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,000
through today um we'll

92
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,839
actually discuss what is a software

93
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,800
security operation center or

94
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,680
or an msp or an mssp however we want to

95
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,159
term it

96
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,000
some of the characteristics with these

97
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,440
with a sock what's good about them

98
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,680
what's bad and

99
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,879
some underlying concerns sorry some

100
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,080
underpinning concerns that we've had

101
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,840
over the years

102
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,200
uh we'll also discuss some of our broad

103
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,080
observations and

104
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,920
uh conclude with well a path to how we

105
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,920
keep them in check

106
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,040
but i think for me it's important to

107
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,640
start with the story and

108
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,280
this story was really one of those

109
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:45,040
things that had codified

110
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,879
um a lot of my views and perceptions and

111
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,959
even approaches with how we

112
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,920
we deal with security operation centers

113
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,080
so

114
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:54,559
this was a an internal pen test that my

115
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:58,159
team had

116
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:01,360
sometime last year um where

117
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,879
i turned up day one 9 am and i

118
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,400
i have a personal preference when i

119
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,079
start a pen test i

120
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,000
like to spin up wireshark and actually

121
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,720
see what's happening on the network that

122
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,280
i'm on

123
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:13,200
um a couple of things that we saw there

124
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,200
was a

125
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,320
there was just going knack in place that

126
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,399
kicked in after about

127
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,839
a few minutes but what was really

128
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:22,078
interesting was without any

129
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:24,000
authentication or access control uh

130
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,040
within two minutes we had to main admin

131
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,360
because uh domain administrators were

132
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:32,160
communicating to a clear text

133
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,840
sql service uh using their domain

134
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,440
credentials

135
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,080
so all right this was getting a little

136
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,280
bit of a a little bit concerning for us

137
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,159
all right this is just some basic

138
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:45,359
hygiene stuff that you really should be

139
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,320
be doing right admittedly we were uh

140
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,120
on a administrative subnet to kick off

141
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,360
with

142
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,120
but then about 20 minutes later we

143
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:58,639
kicked into our first iteration of um

144
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,680
of network scans off the back of which

145
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,160
uh we found eternal blue not once but on

146
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,880
170 different systems

147
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,240
uh we also found consistent logins as

148
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:11,840
the local administrator

149
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,759
as domain administrators

150
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,919
and off the back of that we started

151
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,960
layering in rc2 and

152
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:22,159
moving through the network uh

153
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:26,159
by the end of the first

154
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:28,400
four and a half hours um we

155
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,199
were camped on the ceos desktop uh

156
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,359
reporting

157
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,360
everything they were doing uh we had

158
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,160
access to a really sensitive database as

159
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,240
well

160
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,720
um and it's usually at this point i

161
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,720
start initiating incident response

162
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,479
just because the degree to which we were

163
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,759
able to get in

164
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,758
was a little disconcerting

165
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,840
we managed to also capture a lot of dns

166
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,080
traffic and observe that hey

167
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:53,840
there's a bunch of adware going out as

168
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,159
well some other activities are a little

169
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,758
bit

170
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,520
concerning so realistically i then spent

171
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,880
the remainder of day one and a good

172
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,000
portion of day two

173
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,000
not only going through our

174
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,400
post-exploitation scenarios that we

175
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,520
factor into our assessments but i also

176
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,280
started thinking well

177
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,359
someone's beating us to the mark here

178
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,719
that they would have had to and

179
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,520
unfortunately we never really got to the

180
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,039
part of that because by day three

181
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:21,120
i had internal audit that

182
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,120
was adjacent to our test so our

183
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,319
activities were commissioned

184
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,039
um by the it

185
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:30,880
manager but internal audit was quite

186
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:32,560
insistent that the internal network was

187
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,719
secure because a spreadsheet that was

188
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,639
provided by a security operation centre

189
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,560
said no everything's secure

190
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,319
um internal audit was also quite

191
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,240
insistent uh

192
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,360
that what we did and the actions we took

193
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,960
were inflammatory

194
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,479
they also were insistent that as a

195
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,599
mitigating control that this was an

196
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,280
internal network

197
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,880
and nothing bad could ever happen

198
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,880
notwithstanding the fact that we were

199
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,280
capturing dns traffic

200
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,719
that would suggest otherwise so off the

201
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,159
back of this

202
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,240
we then decided to do a demonstration of

203
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,759
what would code execution look like on

204
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,080
local systems

205
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,479
uh off the back of which we managed to

206
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:13,120
create a command control channel out to

207
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:15,758
our own infrastructure sitting in aws

208
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:17,120
that allowed us to effectively perform

209
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:20,800
all the actions we did

210
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,599
on day one from the internet

211
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,080
based on the assumption of malware which

212
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,759
uh

213
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,639
sorry based on the assumption of malware

214
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,840
presented through ad campaigns which

215
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,520
uh funnily enough my colleague um

216
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,039
caleb house was doing a lot of research

217
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,599
on so he's actually built out some

218
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,800
really cool

219
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,319
vitality tools uh that we we had

220
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,360
actually hope to employ on future

221
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,280
engagements

222
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,520
with civil clients like this but off the

223
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,878
back of those we're able to execute code

224
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,639
funnily enough we actually got to a

225
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,840
point uh where we started sailrite how

226
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,599
far could we get

227
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,520
uh we got to a point where none of our

228
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,360
hope was getting obstricated

229
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,960
um this should have been stuff that

230
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,080
should have been getting picked up

231
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:02,318
and it wasn't and the sock hadn't

232
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,758
seen any of our work at all so by the

233
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,520
end of day three

234
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,120
um so correction come back to day one

235
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,799
we kept our upset a little bit limited

236
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,879
because this engagement was quite tight

237
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,919
we were picked up by the end of day

238
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,759
three

239
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,039
we had no observation we were using

240
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,639
straight out

241
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:24,000
materia predator shells going over hcps

242
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:25,599
and there was absolutely no detection

243
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,360
and this really came back to me and

244
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,560
something that really started to upset

245
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,400
me was the

246
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,840
uh internal audit function with this

247
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:35,039
organization

248
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:38,559
um had been so convinced uh that

249
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,319
the msp that they were using um

250
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,679
had actually taken care of them to a

251
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,480
very good standard based

252
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,079
purely on spreadsheets and other reports

253
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,519
that were getting set to them

254
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,440
that they were so invested

255
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,240
in reinforcing that they were secured

256
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:57,440
that the the end result was um

257
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:59,760
was well no one really

258
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,440
yeah the end result is still kind of

259
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:04,319
ongoing even 12 months

260
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,440
on but this was also the second time we

261
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,080
did this assessment

262
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,120
uh previously i had another staff member

263
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,120
deliver this one

264
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,279
um this was the one i i said all right i

265
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,959
actually want to have a look at this

266
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,800
and really go into a bit of detail on

267
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,640
this also it turns out it was the only

268
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,079
one free at the time

269
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:26,880
so for the second time we actually

270
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:29,120
found uh 170 instances of turtle blood

271
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,760
which was down from about 250 so it was

272
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,680
evident

273
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,040
a few people actually knew hey the sock

274
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,199
was actually not getting maintained we

275
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,079
need to probably start looking at it

276
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,880
um and so you know some of our root

277
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,800
causes

278
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,600
that form kind of reporting our analysis

279
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,040
was um

280
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,959
no one took the time to actually

281
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,719
understand and codify what it was that

282
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,599
that sock had did and actually enforce

283
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,440
it

284
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,560
and ensure that the responsibilities and

285
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,320
governance were actually getting

286
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,719
properly taken care of

287
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,360
um i've just noted at the bottom here

288
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,360
our our

289
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,680
tests were probably about two to three

290
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,200
percent of what this organization was

291
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,719
paying every year

292
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,399
for a managed security service that was

293
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,079
doing absolutely nothing

294
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,680
and then of course we put that relative

295
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,160
to the cost of an attack

296
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,359
um if these guys had been you know it

297
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,920
was by pure luck

298
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,880
the uh that this company hadn't actually

299
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,439
been hit

300
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,320
with the ransomware campaign um just

301
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,839
given the

302
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,560
ability we were able to achieve with

303
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,279
actual movement

304
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,560
so now that we've had that little

305
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,959
appreciation that

306
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,239
that story i guess our next question

307
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,279
here really is well what

308
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,640
what is a sock um

309
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:42,720
so socks msps mssps

310
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:45,600
the the term itself varies and changes

311
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,040
a lot and is often interchangeable with

312
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,240
a lot of language that gets put out

313
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,719
there and so

314
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,640
um this inconsistency in the term i

315
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:54,560
think has actually contributed to

316
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,800
understanding what is the role and

317
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,959
responsibilities of

318
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,640
an outsourced provider that that you're

319
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,719
employing so

320
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,240
this has kind of been one of those uh

321
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,880
discussions that's been going on for 10

322
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,560
years i

323
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,160
even remember a colleague of mine that

324
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,319
was at ozer

325
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,439
uh would have been about 2011 where he

326
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,120
pointed out well

327
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,839
information security is starting to get

328
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,200
called cyber

329
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,720
to which another colleague said well

330
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,920
look if our customers want cyber we'll

331
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,399
give them cyber

332
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,199
off the back of which there was this

333
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,399
whole piece

334
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,839
especially amongst the more experienced

335
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,920
and veteran members of

336
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:31,680
the community of world problem is we're

337
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,040
lacking that specificity with what is

338
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,920
actually taking place and i think this

339
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,199
has been one of those

340
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,439
outcomes of it is someone suddenly spun

341
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,279
up a security operations center and

342
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,120
clearly they are going to be able to do

343
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,040
everything and so

344
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,720
then all of a sudden we now need to dive

345
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,920
deeper into or what is it that the

346
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:50,959
actual stock is doing

347
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,160
is it conducting automated scan is it

348
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:54,079
conducting some sort of holistic

349
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,560
protection is it doing some sort of deep

350
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,160
level threat hunting activity

351
00:11:56,560 --> 00:12:02,079
is it doing full traffic capturing

352
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:05,120
analysis is it maintaining systems

353
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:07,279
that failure of definition um in my

354
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,800
assessment with this company we had

355
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,120
had contributed to the the shortfalls in

356
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,519
the

357
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:18,000
setup for this organization and so

358
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,880
apply that to every internal test that

359
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,200
that we've done

360
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,800
and this inconsistency is just one of

361
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,880
those things that keeps popping up

362
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,319
so it's important to know okay this is

363
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,439
what a sock is but

364
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,040
what are they actually said they're

365
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,839
doing so when we start talking about

366
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,599
sock we actually

367
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:37,279
encompass a very broad church of

368
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,000
different firms and organizations that

369
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:41,040
actually

370
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:46,560
are providing professional services

371
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:49,120
on a fairly regular basis to customers

372
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,399
but why why would you actually use a

373
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,560
sock and i think

374
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:54,240
this isn't this entire talk isn't here

375
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:57,040
really to disparage

376
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,079
um a security operations center i think

377
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,279
when they're

378
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:03,680
organized and orchestrated uh and

379
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,480
integrated really well um they're a

380
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,800
fantastic asset to have on board

381
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,480
and you know common traits with this is

382
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,800
if you look at it

383
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,519
you can actually get some really best of

384
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,760
breed

385
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:20,880
individuals into that organization

386
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,240
there's a particular organization that

387
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,439
we've actually come up against

388
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:27,839
where um their

389
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,880
their tech lead for example ensures that

390
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,800
all of these

391
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,240
people are regularly educated they

392
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:34,399
actually create their own

393
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,639
tools they understand what they're doing

394
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:38,880
um that's a quality and a trait that

395
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,040
you're not going to be able to get

396
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,399
in your own organization and set up

397
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,880
appropriately and i

398
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,079
i've just made a a star there because

399
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,800
it's something i really want to talk

400
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,359
about

401
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,839
a little bit later on during this talk

402
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,360
um

403
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,079
it's also coming back to the

404
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,839
availability of easily scalable and cost

405
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:59,120
effective solutions so

406
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,120
if you simply apply a single capability

407
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,519
to your own organization that's isolated

408
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,480
from

409
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:06,720
the rest of australia you're not

410
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,480
necessarily going to get the

411
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,720
intelligence feeds that you would have

412
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,079
say through a more centralized solution

413
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,480
that's covering off say the entire

414
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:17,199
industry

415
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,040
but also you're having to pay for that

416
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,479
and you're having to pay for the systems

417
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,920
and licensing behind that

418
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,000
that you might actually be able to get

419
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,599
at a cheaper cost

420
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,920
if it's scaled amongst and shared

421
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,440
amongst multiple individuals

422
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,240
um there's always this talk about skill

423
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,639
shortage i'm always 50 50 about

424
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,800
about the the concept that we actually

425
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,360
have a skill shortage in this country

426
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,040
um and i think there's actually some

427
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,720
really awesome and really talented

428
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,880
individuals out there

429
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,720
but we often overlook them because we

430
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,360
are looking to somewhat perfect

431
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,480
um so i'll just have that as a side

432
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,079
comment there but

433
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,760
one of the points we talk about is skill

434
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,399
shortage ideally

435
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,839
a stop will actually be able to address

436
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,279
that skill shortage especially if you're

437
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,279
having to deal with

438
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,360
real deep subject matter expertise say

439
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,839
in the case of threat hunting and open

440
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,959
source intelligence capabilities

441
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:08,720
i've kind of touched there before in

442
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,920
that concentration of course of you

443
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,440
actually have a lot of people there

444
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,519
ready to go

445
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,880
who have had that exposure to multiple

446
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,360
environments and they're doing this

447
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,760
actually

448
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,600
day in and day out and finally

449
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:23,439
it's important that you should actually

450
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,320
be in a position where you start freeing

451
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,880
up your internal

452
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,800
resources to focus on core tasks that

453
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,399
can't be delivered by an outsourcer

454
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,839
so this was always the thing with say

455
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:33,839
providing

456
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,839
simple repeatable reproducible tasks

457
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,320
such as server maintenance

458
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,399
and laptop fleet management is if that

459
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,720
task be outsourced to a

460
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,880
third provider and it's cheaper than the

461
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,360
resources that you pay for internally

462
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,279
go for it um but unfortunately that's

463
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,680
not always something that

464
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,279
that we see and all of a sudden i come

465
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,120
back to that term i said about we

466
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:58,079
conflate the language with which

467
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,519
we're conducting security and all of a

468
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,359
sudden

469
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:04,079
our key activities that our core tasks

470
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:07,040
and even say things like

471
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,599
like doing a a strategic analysis piece

472
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,040
that

473
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,959
we probably need to be doing ourselves

474
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,719
suddenly gets pushed out so

475
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,239
understanding what your core tasks are

476
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,920
being able to

477
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,079
um to divide those tasks and conduct

478
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,319
your um

479
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,079
division of who's doing what effectively

480
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,480
to ensure

481
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,880
that your resources are properly managed

482
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,480
is fantastic when it's done right

483
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,000
but that really comes back to your

484
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,079
internal assessment of right this is

485
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,839
what my focus needs to be

486
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:38,319
but what's what's actually been really

487
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,240
bad or what have we seen gone terribly

488
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,639
wrong in this space

489
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:44,240
i touched there before on that hand over

490
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,720
integration of duties

491
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,600
uh so does your actual outsourcer

492
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,880
understand

493
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,320
what their role is and what they're

494
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,079
doing and do they have the context

495
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,199
behind the organization

496
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:57,439
um that they're actually

497
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,479
conducting an assessment on and off the

498
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:00,079
so that they're actually

499
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,240
employing their services against and off

500
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,199
the back of that does that translate

501
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,559
into

502
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:09,760
um into them being able to

503
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:13,599
detect and respond effectively

504
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,799
so if you're just simply dumping a heap

505
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,359
of technology into an

506
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,000
organization that's a little bit

507
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,719
disingenuous

508
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,679
and it also disengages from that piece

509
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,360
of handing over

510
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,880
integrating and understanding what it is

511
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:26,559
you're monitoring and so

512
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,319
i also come back to that context piece

513
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,600
this came back off another test we did

514
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,440
late last year

515
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,959
where there was a fantastic provider

516
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,799
that was in place

517
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,799
the problem is though the provider was

518
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,600
completely oblivious to the fact

519
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:41,679
that this company was in fact on a

520
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,879
hybrid cloud and local environments the

521
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,760
cloud environment wasn't getting

522
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,520
monitored

523
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,480
which is where a ton of data was that we

524
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:51,840
were able to excel effectively

525
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,000
so being unable to

526
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,959
to map that out and understand that at a

527
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,960
very high level

528
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,520
was just one of those lessons that got

529
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,960
learned probably more so by the customer

530
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,879
than the actual

531
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,200
provider of the security service um

532
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,919
so supporting processes is another

533
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,919
interesting one

534
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:17,280
security operations centers uh or

535
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,480
selling sock as a service

536
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:24,080
um if you are a sales person

537
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:27,120
the the average cost of a a stock can be

538
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:28,879
anywhere from the below six figures all

539
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,879
the way up to in the case we had

540
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,039
uh before the scenario i was talking

541
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:36,559
about into seven figures

542
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:38,400
so suddenly uh sales

543
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,840
will actually push it so and this has

544
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,160
been an experience i've seen

545
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:43,439
a lot of it in the last 10 years is the

546
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,720
sales process will actually

547
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,520
push ahead and drive the need for these

548
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,240
high value

549
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,679
services that are notionally niche but

550
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,840
haven't actually gone through

551
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,080
and consider things like governance and

552
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,000
the operational liability of maintaining

553
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:00,639
those systems and we'll see that in a

554
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,640
second here

555
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,080
integration as well and when i talk

556
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,678
about integration that's actually

557
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,120
integrating with internal effects as

558
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,799
well

559
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,320
or not just simply dumping a bunch of

560
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,240
tools but making sure those tools are

561
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,520
effectively orchestrated and also being

562
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,440
able to work between

563
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,360
a network operations center that needs

564
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,039
to maintain systems and their uptime

565
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:24,000
versus a sock which is probably more

566
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:26,160
focused on making sure that

567
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,520
everything's being locked down properly

568
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,320
um

569
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,039
skilled resources as well is another big

570
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,200
problem

571
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,200
um so

572
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,799
i'll actually come back to that a little

573
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,000
bit later in one of the scenarios

574
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,160
examples i talk through

575
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,039
security ownership so who's responsible

576
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,559
for what

577
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:48,559
um if security ownership isn't

578
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,960
appropriately identified as to who owns

579
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,879
what who's responsible where

580
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,000
that also starts to undermine the

581
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,200
efficacy

582
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,080
of your sock capability and sorry

583
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:00,559
capacity and

584
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,720
responsibility offshoring visibility

585
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,600
who's maintaining information

586
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,200
all these things which go terribly

587
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,678
terribly wrong

588
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,960
if there isn't effective management and

589
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:15,360
oversight

590
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,360
in getting these capabilities underway

591
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,639
so this was something really peculiar as

592
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,720
i started preparing for this talk and

593
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,159
started researching i think this is

594
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:28,159
also part of a broader piece in terms of

595
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:29,360
concerns i have across the industry

596
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:34,320
which is

597
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:36,399
uh if we have a look at the the

598
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,559
technical roles which are usually going

599
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:42,400
to be people at the coalface

600
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:43,678
um are often neglected in terms of

601
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,200
training and development

602
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:51,039
and preparation so for example

603
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,559
the two cases that i have here

604
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,879
are probably a little bit more mature in

605
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:56,799
their training and individual capability

606
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,640
development than we have say for

607
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,799
network operations but they were two

608
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,080
very important ones that funnily enough

609
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,679
i extracted from um

610
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,199
from one of the security operations

611
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,280
providers that is

612
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,679
uh a project manager uh which can be

613
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,520
trained up uh in a weekend aggression

614
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,039
in five days for two thousand six

615
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,158
hundred ninety five dollars excluding

616
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:18,720
gst

617
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,039
uh will later translate to a salary of

618
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,400
this particular company between 120

619
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:26,320
and 156 000 whereas

620
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,320
a a diploma in software development

621
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,320
which is going to take time

622
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:32,320
your average fee is about seven thousand

623
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,039
four hundred fifty six dollars

624
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,760
uh for an end salary of between fifty

625
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,440
three thousand

626
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,879
and ninety six thousand dollars which

627
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:42,320
means that

628
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:44,240
uh if we were to also apply

629
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,320
this approach to the people that we have

630
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,799
that are responsible for overseeing

631
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,960
and managing technical delivery if we

632
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:53,440
apply this hierarchical approach there

633
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,880
suddenly the people that we are

634
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,640
employing on the ground doing those

635
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,240
technical tasks

636
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,320
are not necessarily always going to be

637
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,799
the best and brightest relative to

638
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,480
say someone higher up into their project

639
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:05,840
manager or even in the service delivery

640
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,559
management role

641
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,158
so this this hierarchical approach to

642
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,120
that cost of head count

643
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,000
kind of starts kind of starts having a

644
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,080
very negative

645
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,919
influence from a um you know just purely

646
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,158
from an economic standpoint that

647
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,039
because we're not paying our technical

648
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,440
staff

649
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,158
the same level as we do for someone who

650
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,320
may have

651
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:28,080
just come into say project management

652
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,000
and has a very low barrier to entry in

653
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,360
terms of qualification and prior skills

654
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,320
versus the ongoing development

655
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,959
requirements

656
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,720
for technical activities uh it does

657
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:39,360
actually mean we have a very negative

658
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,799
influence on the quality and caliber of

659
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,360
individuals that we're going to attract

660
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,360
those roles

661
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,240
keep those figures in mind when i start

662
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:52,559
talking about our cost of head count in

663
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:54,559
our analysis here so we actually started

664
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,559
off the back of several engagements

665
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,039
we've done we actually started looking

666
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,158
at three security operation centers and

667
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,360
across all of these

668
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:06,159
it was a very heavy emphasis on uh

669
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,639
sales as opposed to the actual delivery

670
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:09,679
of

671
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:12,240
tasks so one of them had about 30 odd

672
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:15,039
staff of which they had five people

673
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,760
in their sock they then had a sales

674
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,200
workforce

675
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,799
of about 10 personnel so if you come

676
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:22,880
back to the

677
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,320
the costs that i had illustrated

678
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:27,679
previously

679
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:31,039
if you've got say your five techies that

680
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:34,320
are averaging say about

681
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:36,879
anywhere from 50 to 80 000

682
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,600
that translates to their cost being

683
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,080
about

684
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,199
400k and then you look at say large

685
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,439
sales scales or

686
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:46,080
service delivery management task force

687
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,679
at a salary cost of say about 1.5

688
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,080
million dollars

689
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:51,840
suddenly the only way that those sort of

690
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,480
salaries can be sustained

691
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,279
is if your stock is taking on a lot more

692
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,279
work

693
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:59,360
than it's actually capable to meet so

694
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,000
suddenly if there's large scale

695
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,479
incidents

696
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,679
if the stock isn't well rehearsed well

697
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,480
trained

698
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,480
and prepared this tooth to tail ratio

699
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:10,240
will actually start to

700
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,600
have a negative impact on their ability

701
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,640
to deliver

702
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,760
uh results furthermore we also look at

703
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,039
and this was kind of influenced off the

704
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,440
back of an article i was reading on

705
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,559
on telecommunications industry structure

706
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,120
in

707
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:27,520
canada the u.s australia for the last

708
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:29,918
couple years about how

709
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,760
over the last 25 years because the

710
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,919
incentive has actually been focused on

711
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,960
quarterly sales as opposed to capability

712
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,360
development

713
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,240
we're now at a point where a firm-like

714
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,918
highway

715
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,600
which has actually had that focus on

716
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:43,520
capability development

717
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:45,760
is a far more mature state and has a lot

718
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,600
more capability to provide

719
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,600
relative to their competitors in the

720
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,760
west so

721
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,840
all these factors start to incentivize

722
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,360
the wrong behavior

723
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,039
so i come back to the piece i was

724
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,639
talking about in terms of the cost of

725
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,720
labor

726
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:02,640
because we're not actually using

727
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,600
salaries to attract the right

728
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,320
um level of labor plus also if we look

729
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,080
at

730
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,039
the time and space it requires to

731
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:13,760
actually build out a functional team

732
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:15,840
um as well as that downward pressure on

733
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:18,080
salaries in an outsourcer

734
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:20,000
the capacity to maintain experience and

735
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,320
depth in those organizations

736
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,360
starts to have a accumulative negative

737
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,559
effect

738
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,479
and then off the back of that we start

739
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:27,918
to see heavy dependence on tool sets and

740
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,720
less on information management and

741
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:32,400
intelligence and

742
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:34,080
organizing uh just because and i think

743
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,400
i'm still in two minds about this as to

744
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,080
whether it's a default or

745
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,960
as to whether it's something more

746
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,120
tangible i.e here is a box

747
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,640
here is a set of software that i'm able

748
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,760
to sell and articulate this is a

749
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,520
tangible activity

750
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:50,400
whereas less tangible activities like

751
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,320
information management and intelligence

752
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,760
are a lot harder to sell and push and

753
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,439
therefore

754
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,400
your sales staff will actually fall back

755
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,400
onto what's visible

756
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,559
as i said before and this is a recurring

757
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,440
theme that we see in outsources

758
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:06,960
is how do you contextualize and actually

759
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,159
understand the environment that you're

760
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,600
operating in

761
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,760
so that your stock is actually

762
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,719
delivering the intended effects to the

763
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:15,360
customer

764
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,880
so if all you are doing is waiting for

765
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:19,039
someone to run an

766
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,400
essa scan and you are there to flag that

767
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,679
because that's exactly what your tool

768
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,440
set's telling you

769
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,360
that's not necessarily going to help

770
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,919
save the level of well here's a bunch of

771
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,840
dns

772
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,360
requests we had these ones that are

773
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,279
probably concerning the ones that we

774
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,039
probably need to black hole

775
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,400
interesting observation i also had as

776
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,559
well and this uh

777
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,799
funnily enough came off the back of us

778
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,720
issuing our pen test report

779
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:43,120
and really raping this firm over the

780
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,120
coals suddenly

781
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,879
a few months after our work they

782
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,918
employed a pen tester

783
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,600
and this was a single pen tester with

784
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,440
no prior experience it was then their

785
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,959
actual pen testers so

786
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,559
we're also starting to see that shift

787
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,679
with some of these socks too to pen

788
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:00,000
testing

789
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,880
um as to whether that's legitimately pen

790
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,720
testing or

791
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,919
we've just given a kid a couple of tools

792
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,600
to to run

793
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,880
and we're calling it pen testing i think

794
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,080
that's going to be interesting and for

795
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,679
me this is also going to

796
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,360
to influence the pen testing space in

797
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:13,200
the years to come up

798
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,959
all right you've now got a pen testing

799
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,640
capability but are they actually

800
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,320
thinking through contextualizing their

801
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,039
work or are they just running tools

802
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,120
which

803
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,960
um i'm sure lucas would also agree with

804
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,520
me is probably something that we've been

805
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,440
seeing

806
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,440
a lot more of over the last six years

807
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:36,720
so how do we actually deal with our

808
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:39,600
sock and how do we keep them in check um

809
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:41,200
one opportunity and approach i've really

810
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,439
liked reading up on and

811
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,880
executing when i can is this purple

812
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,919
teaming approach that is your pen

813
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,200
testers

814
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:51,440
that are outside uh

815
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,640
that are outside an objective but remain

816
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,640
inside and aware

817
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,320
can actually sit down and collaborate

818
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:59,120
with the stock effectively

819
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,000
and guide them i make that point of you

820
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,279
you want them to be

821
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,200
outside an objective now for the simple

822
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,320
fact that if they start integrating with

823
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,960
the team

824
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,120
then what extra value are they providing

825
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:12,080
say relative to that rotation of a fresh

826
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,879
human being

827
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,320
a fresh set of eyes uh to a project and

828
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,279
if that's iterably condoned

829
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,960
if that's iterably done over time um

830
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:23,520
many eyes make bug shallow

831
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:25,840
it actually improves the quality of the

832
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,399
team of the sock capability and keeps

833
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:29,439
them

834
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:32,879
uh fresh and and

835
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,640
and um and on their toes the problem is

836
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,200
that this is a really time consuming

837
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,320
process

838
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,240
and the iterative approach may actually

839
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,480
not be what some organizations are

840
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,559
looking for it can also be quite costly

841
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,520
especially if you're paying effectively

842
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:49,200
for

843
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,639
a a tech resource that has a regular

844
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,640
subject matter expertise

845
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:54,240
and you're having to pay for that you

846
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,440
know five or ten days once a month or

847
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:57,120
once a quarter

848
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,880
i'd also say this requires a level of

849
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:01,678
maturity as well so

850
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,279
if you have a very hierarchical approach

851
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,679
to how you've actually generated your

852
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,320
stock

853
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,679
or if you have a very heavy sales focus

854
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,360
suddenly the sales team thinks that

855
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:12,640
they're constantly getting criticized

856
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,918
and and that the entire approach is

857
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,720
quite negative

858
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,679
um which undermines their own confidence

859
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,559
or

860
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,080
um doesn't or actually turns into

861
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:25,039
something quite standoffish

862
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,000
additionally if your pen tester is just

863
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:28,158
here because they

864
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,080
like dominating other human beings and

865
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,559
like marking at other people

866
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:34,080
um that actually creates a very negative

867
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:38,158
morale effect and so

868
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:40,240
if you're if your pen tester is there

869
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,720
and they're not actually there to

870
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:45,360
improve the quality of the organization

871
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:46,960
um it's gonna really create a massive

872
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:50,000
morale issue and that's gonna do more

873
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:52,799
damage than where you're at beforehand

874
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,559
we can also of course keep consistently

875
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:57,360
applying our traditional testing and red

876
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:59,918
teaming approaches

877
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,959
and doing those on a regular ad hoc

878
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,480
basis

879
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,520
reality is that's probably more of an

880
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,600
adjusted time audit function

881
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,960
in some ways it's it's useful in a lot

882
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,480
of other ways i don't think that's

883
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,679
actually contributed

884
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:16,640
uh as effectively as we really

885
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,039
want to in terms of identifying flaws

886
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,440
with

887
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:21,200
um with soft providers and actually

888
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,960
seeing improvement

889
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,320
so one of the other things and this is

890
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,640
something that we've probably done with

891
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,520
three or four clients over the last

892
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,520
uh last few months uh is what we refer

893
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,120
to as our stock validation process

894
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,799
and this is something i'm really keen to

895
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,360
actually see get adopted a lot more in

896
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:39,200
industry

897
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,158
by fellow testers by anyone working in a

898
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:43,520
governance

899
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:48,159
capacity which is to actually do

900
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:49,918
targeted which is to actually target any

901
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,720
performance measures and service level

902
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,320
agreements

903
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,919
that a stock has actually stipulated

904
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,840
they'll do

905
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,200
and if they haven't done that then

906
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,879
coming back to all right what is it that

907
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:02,080
you've actually been sold

908
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:05,440
and doesn't make any sense so

909
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:08,559
by having that kpi or sla focus

910
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:11,679
the actual traditional test approach

911
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,080
methodology can be sharpened down to a

912
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,880
very

913
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,240
tight testing activity so for example uh

914
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,760
we had this with a client

915
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,279
with whom we would normally do about a

916
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:23,360
fiber then five or ten day pen test with

917
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,399
we narrowed down our pen test to four

918
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,840
hours

919
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:29,840
um based on five slas

920
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,439
that the security provider had said they

921
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,959
would achieve

922
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,120
and so we were then able to provide a

923
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,320
very concise short sharp to the point

924
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,158
report saying

925
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,760
here is sla one that they will respond

926
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,840
to x event

927
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,679
within four hours here's something they

928
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,439
haven't done

929
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,120
but the other element to this and i

930
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,279
think this comes back to incentivizing

931
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,760
the right sort of behavior

932
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,919
is to actually focus on cost recovery as

933
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,640
part of your effort so

934
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,760
this activity of due diligence and this

935
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,200
activity of

936
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:00,960
you know coming back to money because

937
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:02,080
right now that's the massive driver

938
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,120
behind throwing a

939
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,960
stock at someone is if you can actually

940
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,879
incentivize the right behavior by saying

941
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,600
well if you don't do the right thing

942
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,720
it's

943
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,320
it's going to cost you more than

944
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,279
actually doing the right thing and

945
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,840
having the

946
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,480
right team the right capability in play

947
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,080
um

948
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,919
that's going to lead to a much better

949
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,519
outcome um

950
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,640
i mean for me i have a personal

951
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,519
preference on all right let's

952
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,360
collaborate

953
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,320
collaborate and you know be excellent to

954
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,199
each other and make a better

955
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:31,279
organization

956
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:34,000
but when when there is a massive focus

957
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,440
on hey we've got to push as much product

958
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,320
out the door as possible

959
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:39,440
the slightly more aggressive approach i

960
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,639
hopefully should

961
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,799
temper and hopefully should temper

962
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,799
and

963
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,559
and make and

964
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:52,480
you know make people actually realize

965
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:53,279
hey this is the approach you should be

966
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,080
taking

967
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:57,279
so i guess bottom line up front make

968
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,000
sure that you pull your socks up

969
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,679
regularly

970
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,519
uh call them out for anything that they

971
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,679
need to be looking at

972
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,360
um and actually really hammer home hard

973
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,320
on some of the activities that

974
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,360
um that your socks should actually be

975
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,519
doing

976
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,360
um folks look that ends my presentation

977
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:16,159
um we've got

978
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:17,279
we've got about five or five to eight

979
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:19,200
minutes for questions

980
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,320
so we've got plenty of time questions

981
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,399
excellent

982
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:26,480
fantastic thank you very very good

983
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,918
i said before is it it's great seeing

984
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:31,200
seeing friends up on stage

985
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:33,200
be virtual or not um so

986
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,120
and having a look through the chat as

987
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:39,360
you were presenting i think the uh

988
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:41,439
the sentiment was uh was amen

989
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,799
definitely and speaking from personal

990
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,799
experience of being

991
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:47,279
on the red team side for a very long

992
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:49,440
time also that testing

993
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:51,360
the sock is is something that you should

994
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,000
do on a regular basis

995
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,080
and you know just the point of to add as

996
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,440
well and actually

997
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,960
too with around testing out source and

998
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,640
third-party socks

999
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:05,039
the experience that i've had with

1000
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,679
decision makers has always been

1001
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:10,000
uh a quite well-timed one because

1002
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:14,320
they've been in renegotiation

1003
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:17,520
art the potential kind of avenue

1004
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:22,320
have you had similar kind of

1005
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:23,679
um so i i would actually say the

1006
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,440
probably the best one we had in the last

1007
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,119
few months was when the stock was

1008
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:30,399
actually getting introduced

1009
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,040
um these guys had five tasks that were

1010
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,679
formed

1011
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,599
platform part of their sla and funnily

1012
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:38,240
enough we identified that their product

1013
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,960
uh didn't actually do any of them which

1014
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,239
was

1015
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:42,240
quite useful because these guys were

1016
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,918
about to do a massive push into the

1017
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,879
australian market so they've had to go

1018
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,960
back in

1019
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,078
and do a ton of improvements which you

1020
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,359
know was something i

1021
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:51,520
was quite happy with i mean it was a

1022
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:53,359
little embarrassing on their side but

1023
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:54,879
to have that happen as opposed to these

1024
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,359
guys having to deal with the liability

1025
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,839
of

1026
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,598
uh getting hit later is good but yeah

1027
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:02,880
the renegotiation

1028
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,760
of contracts piece is is something that

1029
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,400
i think we've only done

1030
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,920
once in the last two years um a lot of

1031
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,839
this has kind of been more business as

1032
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:13,200
usual activity

1033
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,320
yeah fantastic uh so do have some

1034
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,520
questions come in

1035
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:21,520
what was around do you have any

1036
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:22,800
um or target kpis or

1037
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,960
or anything of the like that you that

1038
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,079
you can share or or maybe talk through

1039
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,800
as well here

1040
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,160
um yeah let me bring up some of the

1041
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,200
stuff that we've had in the past

1042
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:34,480
um i'm happy so that individual if you

1043
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,680
have a look on my

1044
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,280
slide deck there there is a an email

1045
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,319
address there's also a qr code if you

1046
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,359
trust me

1047
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:45,760
um but yeah feel free to email

1048
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:47,359
and um you know i can send you over a

1049
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:48,720
few samples that we've had

1050
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:51,040
around that around specific and

1051
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,520
measurable requirements

1052
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,800
fantastic and some other questions kind

1053
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,400
of popping in

1054
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:01,520
how does the monthly pintest program go

1055
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:03,839
testing stocks it depends

1056
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,119
so there's a an organization that we've

1057
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,599
just started working with that actually

1058
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,200
wants to go down that monthly program

1059
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,359
but that's also business they've got the

1060
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,560
the depth of capability to

1061
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:16,880
deal with a monthly program

1062
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:20,000
the thing i'd caution against with with

1063
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:22,800
monthly pen test programs

1064
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,960
is how do you make sure that you are not

1065
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,200
demoralizing the sock

1066
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,960
but also are you veering and changing

1067
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:31,520
things up

1068
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,000
in you know are you varying and changing

1069
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,960
things up

1070
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,800
enough so that your team's actually

1071
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,880
cycling through iteratively into other

1072
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,680
parts of the organization

1073
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:43,119
so we've now got that with a client of

1074
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,560
ours we've said okay look

1075
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,480
the internal environment none of your

1076
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,520
staff are in-house so there's a sudden

1077
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:50,400
change you've done with the

1078
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,800
these applications um let's actually see

1079
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,560
that

1080
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,640
your monitoring capability works on

1081
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:56,160
those and that you're actually

1082
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,680
recording the right to the logs in those

1083
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,839
apps so

1084
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,960
yeah fantastic and we've got another one

1085
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,400
we've got plenty plenty coming through

1086
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,119
this is fantastic we've got plenty of

1087
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:08,400
time as well

1088
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:10,160
so um there seems to be a focus on docs

1089
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,760
what about internal stocks any

1090
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:13,118
differences to approach to monitoring

1091
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:16,880
internal socks

1092
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:18,880
um yeah so i guess you you're looking at

1093
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:21,760
with a third-party stock you actually

1094
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:24,160
have a clearly specified contract

1095
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,359
and a clear set of requirements there

1096
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,078
internal socks

1097
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:29,520
you know really comes back to how big is

1098
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:31,040
the organization and

1099
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,800
are you doing like say for example

1100
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:34,079
internal unit billing

1101
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,320
have a look at how the business is

1102
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:39,359
structured and probably

1103
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,800
even evolve it less into a

1104
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:42,160
probably even evolve more into that sort

1105
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,839
of educational activity when you're

1106
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,520
dealing with an internal environment

1107
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:47,359
so i talked before about that purple

1108
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,400
teaming approach that may be a little

1109
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,960
bit more appropriate

1110
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:53,119
than doing say a more what i would call

1111
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,560
a a darker approach where you'd focus on

1112
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:57,520
cost recovery

1113
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,320
so this that that piece would probably

1114
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,920
be

1115
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,920
from the internal standpoint better

1116
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,359
focus if you were educating that turtle

1117
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:05,760
team

1118
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:06,720
yeah uh another point to add there i

1119
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,280
think would be also

1120
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,118
whether yeah i come from a culture of

1121
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:15,280
slas as well

1122
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:17,520
i think in between the culture tack on

1123
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,280
be part of a larger conversation you

1124
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:21,119
have to have first in order to

1125
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,040
to drive those things but if it's

1126
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:25,119
security talking to an internal security

1127
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,880
team then then mostly it will be uh

1128
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,960
internal conversation you can easily

1129
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,320
easily have we've got another question

1130
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:32,160
from paul

1131
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,480
do you know of any template that

1132
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:37,598
captures roles and responsibilities

1133
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:41,200
and the activity split decisions

1134
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:43,119
um interesting question

1135
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,839
i would say it would vary from from

1136
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:49,040
context to context

1137
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:49,920
um in terms of actually templating

1138
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,960
things

1139
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,280
nothing immediately comes to mind but

1140
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,720
um you know i think if you can come back

1141
00:38:55,280 --> 00:39:00,000
to actually what's the intent

1142
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:02,959
of the activity and who's doing what um

1143
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,000
that's actually a yeah a very valuable

1144
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:07,119
one to pull out there

1145
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:08,640
um yeah if we come back on that i think

1146
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:10,720
plating responsibility should be good

1147
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:13,440
otherwise um

1148
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,560
i recall some of my father's talks uh he

1149
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:17,839
was doing

1150
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:19,200
um doing management at a strategy level

1151
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:20,560
out of the macquarie graduate school

1152
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,319
where he actually said

1153
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,839
here's actually how your service level

1154
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:25,119
agreement should be focused and that was

1155
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:27,520
more for

1156
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:28,320
other capability provisions but um yeah

1157
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:31,520
let me come

1158
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:32,960
so who who asked that one uh that was

1159
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,000
paul

1160
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,760
uh maricus okay so i'm

1161
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,200
i'm very sorry if i'm mispronouncing

1162
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:43,040
your surname but uh

1163
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:44,960
i know how you feel look at mine

1164
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,640
i've got a few ideas around that one so

1165
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,520
yeah thank you

1166
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,960
fantastic um and actually do you have

1167
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,160
any success stories

1168
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,240
from stocks that have detected

1169
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,920
activities and

1170
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,279
were they like what were they doing

1171
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:01,359
differently in that

1172
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:03,119
from from what you saw um

1173
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:04,560
so there's two that comes to mind

1174
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,800
actually one of the favorite crews that

1175
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,960
we've come up against was crowdstrike

1176
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:11,359
um and i think that was a mix of their

1177
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,680
tooling uh a mix of their personnel but

1178
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:14,240
they

1179
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:16,240
also actually um you know upon

1180
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:18,479
identification of us being

1181
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:20,319
uh in play they actually started

1182
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,880
alerting the client hey we've just seen

1183
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,560
this

1184
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,920
uh we're starting to diagnose and then

1185
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,240
the client was able to come to us and

1186
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:29,200
say hey guys you've just been seen

1187
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:30,799
that was epic we we got we got picked in

1188
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,879
about 30 seconds

1189
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,640
um and then these guys responded within

1190
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,560
three to five minutes and it was just

1191
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,078
there wasn't any fancy tools that they

1192
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,119
were using it was just

1193
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:43,520
good management on their part

1194
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:45,280

1195
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,960
conversations like that with internal

1196
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:48,480

1203
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:03,279

1212
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,920
already seen

1213
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:24,240
a lot of bad actors that are already out

1214
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,960
there as well as new organizations that

1215
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:27,919
probably haven't that local maturity yet

1216
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:31,200
