1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,440
uh okay sorry about that right

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,600
and just making sure you can see the

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:11,200
right screen looks like you can i will

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:13,040
jump in um so very first up

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,959
i apologize if you've come here looking

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:19,038
for a talk about vendor risk

7
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,039
i did um i did submit a call for paper

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,039
back in january about vendor risk

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,199
and then that seems like an awful long

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,160
time ago and an awful lot has happened

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,279
in that time

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:31,279
so a few months ago i uh approached the

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,800
ozark crew to see if they were amenable

14
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,880
to me switching this talk around and

15
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,559
talking about ransomware and they agreed

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,960
and here we are now i wrote um a talk

17
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,718
that ended up growing and growing and

18
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,719
growing exponentially so i'm conscious

19
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,440
i've got 35 minutes by the time we've

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,280
we've

21
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,599
gotten to this point so i'm going to try

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,199
and race through a lot of material

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:56,079
as quick as i can so first up

24
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,800
let me make sure my thing works who am i

25
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,800
so

26
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,160
most people uh i know work with call me

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,959
pinky eric pinkerton i

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,119
am old guy in the infosec world um you

29
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,320
can find me on twitter or linkedin

30
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:11,119
and the icons there uh are the perento

31
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:13,520
principle the 80 20 rule about how much

32
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,360
uh infosec information versus ship

33
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,399
posting you're likely to see in those

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,439
two

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,119
environments uh obviously i'm here live

36
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,199
i'm not pre-recording this so feel free

37
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,360
to interact throw some questions my way

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,960
show you care and hopefully you'll enjoy

39
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,280
it so

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,640
without further ado let's start at the

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,840
very beginning

42
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,640
um the um

43
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,240
when was the beginning of ransomware so

44
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,439
essentially we're going back to

45
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,759
the wonderful year of 1989.

46
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,839
that was the year that george george

47
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,920
bush senior was sworn in the

48
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,159
year of the tiananmen square massacre

49
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,079
the berlin wall comes down and bond uni

50
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,040
opens its doors in the gold coast for

51
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,759
the first time

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,240
and enter stage left this chat this is

53
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,799
dr

54
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:00,798
joseph popp he's a harvard educated

55
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,840
evolutionary biologist

56
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:06,399
and he had the bright idea to send 20

57
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,640
000 floppy disks to the delegates of the

58
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,599
world health organizations conference on

59
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:13,760
aids and the delefits that sorry the

60
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,839
delegates who ran this software

61
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,920
were infected by what was known what

62
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,959
came to be known as the aids trojan

63
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,839
because of the uh

64
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,000
the name of the conference or pc cyborg

65
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,879
and received a screenshot along these

66
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,120
lines

67
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,440
it was a pretty janky piece of code it

68
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,720
modified the autoexec.bat file on your

69
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,800
computer

70
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,720
and each time you rebooted it set a

71
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,720
counter and when that counter hit 90

72
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,359
times it encrypted your file allocation

73
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,920
table

74
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,360
and in order to get your computer back

75
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,319
and working as you want it

76
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:50,959
you had to send a banker's draft for 189

77
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:54,640
to a perch a po box somewhere in panama

78
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,640
now uh dr pop was a much

79
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,200
better evolutionary biologist than he

80
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,319
was a malware writer

81
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,399
and of course there were a lot of

82
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,238
programs that came out very quickly that

83
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,120
showed it was very easy to recover your

84
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,319
data without paying 189

85
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,000
and the details were a little bit

86
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,319
sketchy and we don't really know how

87
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,159
much money people sent but it's unlikely

88
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,640
he recouped the cost of

89
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,159
the sheer cost of mailing out 20 000

90
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,480
floppy disks uh

91
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,319
he has this story you had the story at

92
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,720
the time that his plan was to

93
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,319
raise money to donate that money to aids

94
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,000
research and he was certainly involved

95
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,920
in aids research

96
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,440
and unfortunately his opsec was about as

97
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,599
good as his coding and he was

98
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:36,159
summarily arrested in the us he was

99
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,079
extradited to the uk to face charges

100
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:40,879
but when he arrived in london he began

101
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:42,239
exhibiting really weird behavior

102
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,879
and according to the british press at

103
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,280
the time um he took to wearing condoms

104
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,920
on his nose he wore a cardboard box on

105
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,080
his head

106
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,559
and he put curlers on his beard to ward

107
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,120
off the the threat of radiation

108
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,120
and of course the ponds uh kind of

109
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,599
reminded me of this guy

110
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,200
the ponds got fed up of this and in

111
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,798
about november 91

112
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,319
they they just shipped him back to the

113
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,159
us where he kind of

114
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:08,000
lived out his day scot-free the sad

115
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,798
ending is unfortunately he died in a

116
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,400
car crash in 2008 so he never really got

117
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,519
to see the legacy of

118
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,880
his crew come to uh the fruition that it

119
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,720
is today

120
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:23,680
um the the after story was in about 96

121
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,520
some i'm guessing bearded sock wearing

122
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,800
sandal wearing academics who were

123
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,599
working with the

124
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,960
ieee published a white paper where they

125
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,600
went through his ransomware and

126
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,919
explained

127
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,880
the problem was that he'd use symmetric

128
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,080
cryptography

129
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,240
not public uh key encryption

130
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,758
and had he used public encryption it

131
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,080
would have been a much more effective

132
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,800
way

133
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,599
so great guys for for giving the malware

134
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,479
or

135
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,400
authors of tomorrow some cool hints on

136
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,120
how to do it better

137
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,560
now from the aids trojan in 89 it was

138
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,040
pretty quiet

139
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,680
we start seeing a few more attacks pop

140
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,800
up in the

141
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,639
sort of early 2000s uh

142
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,840
but they're all pretty flawed as any as

143
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:07,680
any ransomware

144
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,520
any ransom um attacker will tell you the

145
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,039
tricky part is getting away without

146
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,639
getting or getting the money without

147
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,000
getting caught

148
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,240
but at the same time as this was

149
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,800
happening we're seeing the development

150
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,120
of the early parts of cryptocurrency

151
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,080
and of course just in sort of december

152
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,680
january

153
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,359
2008 2009 bitcoin becomes to fruition

154
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,120
and we start reading about you know

155
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,120
there was the chap who paid 10 000

156
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,000
bitcoins for a couple of pizzas

157
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,639
uh we saw silk road come about so now we

158
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,720
have the convergence of these two worlds

159
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,720
and on the september the 5th 2013

160
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,800
a lot of people woke up to a screen that

161
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,800
looked a bit like this and this is the

162
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,479
what most people see as the definitive

163
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,360
beginning of crypto malware

164
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,639
so crypto locker was the first crypto

165
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,800
malware

166
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,919
attack that worked because it married

167
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,400
the um

168
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,960
the concept of ransomware with public

169
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,479
key encryption using aes and rsa private

170
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,359
keys that were stored on the criminals

171
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,080
infrastructure

172
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,560
and of course now we have this easy

173
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,120
method with which to pay that was

174
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,120
well enough understood that people could

175
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,400
actually go and pay

176
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,880
now we don't know what percentage of

177
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,198
people

178
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,800
actually paid there was a survey by

179
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,160
university of kent that

180
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,080
that where 41 of the people who claimed

181
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,600
to be victims said that they decided to

182
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,639
pay the ransom

183
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:32,319
which seems like a really high number

184
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,680
most of the theory and most of the

185
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,720
thinking about that time it was

186
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,120
it was you know less than three percent

187
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:41,280
um but regardless of what the percentage

188
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,199
was it was so successful that the crew

189
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,198
behind it had to adjust the price for

190
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,319
the decryption so it was 100

191
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,639
us dollars in this in bitcoins

192
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,919
in this screenshot and what they were

193
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,759
doing is they were they were

194
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,719
asking for bitcoin and they had to go

195
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,199
from two bitcoin down to .03 bitcoin

196
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,199
within a couple of days because the the

197
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,400
price fluctuations in the bitcoin

198
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,599
exchange rate

199
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,198
was so um changed by the amount of

200
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,240
people who were buying bitcoin in order

201
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,560
to pay off their ransom

202
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,240
now looking at the researchers

203
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,160
subsequently think they netted about

204
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,919
three million dollars u.s

205
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,160
um off the back of this attack and we

206
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:22,560
still don't really know who they were

207
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,639
uh popular theory was a guy called fgne

208
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,000
bogachev because his game over zeus

209
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,960
botnet was one of the means of

210
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,520
distribution

211
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,239
uh he's still living at large in russia

212
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,919
um has

213
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,479
ties to the evil corp and the drydex

214
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,440
group and ironically has a bounty on his

215
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,318
head from the u.s

216
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,160
for three million dollars exactly so if

217
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,280
it is him it's a nice nice little irony

218
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,000
there

219
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,080
okay so in the subsequent years from

220
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,560
crypto locker

221
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:51,919
2013 so the first successful attack

222
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,479
net about 3 million a couple of years

223
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,240
later

224
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,840
by 2015 it's estimated to cost the u.s

225
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,479
alone

226
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,198
325 million dollars that's ransomware

227
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,520
as a as a thing and what we're seeing at

228
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:08,000
that point was mostly high volume

229
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,960
low yield opportunity opportunistic

230
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,280
attacks against

231
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:15,680
end users um by 2016 it was estimated

232
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,520
that it cost the u.s a billion dollars

233
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,599
and at this time a third of british

234
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,719
companies claimed to be stockpiling

235
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,400
bitcoins

236
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,639
on the off chance that they became

237
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,679
victim to attacks of this nature

238
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,000
and around 2016 is where we start to see

239
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,120
that change from these opportunistic

240
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,080
opportunistic

241
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,000
attacks against end users to targeted

242
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,599
attacks against countries which now that

243
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,519
we've come to know is what we call big

244
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:42,560
game hunting

245
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,200
so 2017 cisco did a cyber security

246
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,719
report

247
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,399
where they predicted that ransomware

248
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:49,519
they said ransomware was growing

249
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,519
at about 350 percent um

250
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:52,560
and then we start to see people talking

251
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,800
about the the

252
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,239
sort of there's the zenith of ransomware

253
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,599
and that it was going to start to taper

254
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,760
off because people were

255
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,959
had got the news we had seen the the the

256
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,399
wannacries

257
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,239
and they'd got the message and they were

258
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,959
getting their backups sorted

259
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:09,440
sorted out um there was a great report

260
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,560
at this time in 2018 where the atlanta

261
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,040
city government

262
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,920
spent over 17 million dollars recovering

263
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,959
from attack

264
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:19,920
where the ransom was 52 000

265
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:21,839
and in 2019 we saw baltimore city spend

266
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,399
over 18 million dollars recovering from

267
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,600
an attack

268
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:28,800
where the ransom was 76 000 uh

269
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:31,200
around 2019 we saw norsk hydro get hit

270
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,800
and they were they reportedly spent 85

271
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,680
million dollars recovering

272
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,000
now these numbers quickly got taken by

273
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,680
people

274
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,760
who didn't really understand the

275
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,519
mechanics of this and we start to see

276
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,360
the daft idea floated that it's much

277
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,080
cheaper to pay the ransom than it is to

278
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,040
recover

279
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,600
because if you look at 52 000 on one

280
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,599
hand and

281
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,120
17 million dollars on the other it seems

282
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,680
better to pay 52

283
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,279
million dollars sorry 52 000 but of

284
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,640
course that's a false dichotomy

285
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,320
because you don't pay the ransom and

286
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,680
then get back to business as usual

287
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,600
you then have within short order to to

288
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,880
up your figure out how it happened and

289
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,240
closed the door

290
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,560
otherwise you're going to get attacked

291
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,680
again in quick succession as we saw with

292
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,680
toll group this year

293
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,040
in 2020 the average ransom is reported

294
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,399
at

295
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,480
four thousand dollars but that's a

296
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:23,680
completely nonsense statistic

297
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,399
because organizations now don't choose a

298
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,800
random amount that they think you'll pay

299
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:30,320
based on uh you know what everyone else

300
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,079
pays what they'll do is they'll go and

301
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,320
do research on your organization they'll

302
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:37,680
work out what your

303
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,200
your kind of overall business worth is

304
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,719
using things like zoom info

305
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,640
and they will calculate an amount that

306
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,800
they think you will pay

307
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,920
based on some algorithm around how much

308
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:50,079
they think it will cost you

309
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:52,479
to pay for things like the the pr

310
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,239
fallout and the reputational damage and

311
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,680
the cost of recovery and so on and so

312
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:58,320
forth so it's predicted now that

313
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,839
ransomware is a trillion dollar industry

314
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,920
um and this is 2020. so 2020 is

315
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,680
is what has kind of led to be giving

316
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,719
this talk because 2020

317
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,680
has been insane uh

318
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,839
right at the end of 2019 we saw an

319
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,359
interesting change in tact from the

320
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,200
ransomware gangs

321
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,800
and what happened is they went from

322
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,959
encrypting the information

323
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,959
on the basis that they were hoping you

324
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,680
wouldn't have a decent backup and of

325
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,479
course

326
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,479
by the end of 2019 most organizations

327
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,560
had their backups pretty good

328
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,560
they'd gone and spent a fortune on

329
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,560
really cool off-site backups

330
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:36,560
they'd got their silver bullet and

331
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,599
overnight the attackers changed and

332
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,439
suddenly we weren't

333
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,120
hunting werewolves anymore what they

334
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,120
were doing was was threatening to

335
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,519
publish that information on the dark web

336
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,680
so

337
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,839
may's group led the charge with this

338
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,239
they stood up their first leak site in i

339
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,360
think

340
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,279
december 2019

341
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,839
and then all the other and most of the

342
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,160
other ransomware crews have followed

343
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:59,760
suit

344
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:02,319
so in january this year we saw netwalker

345
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,800
their debut where they hit toll group

346
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:08,079
and travel x were hit by reeval

347
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,599
um talman software is a company that

348
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,439
writes software for the wool industry

349
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,040
were hit in february which which

350
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,000
brought that industry to a halt for a

351
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,760
week or so uh in march henning harders

352
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,480
who are another logistics company got

353
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,880
hit by

354
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,480
maize group in april we saw cognizant

355
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,839
got hit by maze

356
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,680
um in may portal group got hit again

357
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,639
this time by nephilim

358
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:33,120
um june we saw lion group get hit by

359
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,880
rival we saw xerox get hit by maze we

360
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,200
saw garvin get hit by evil

361
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,120
garmin got hit by evil corp and we saw

362
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,360
honda get hit by snake

363
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,399
uh in july we saw carson wagon let

364
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:46,320
travel get hit

365
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:49,519
by ragnar um august we saw canon

366
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,360
lg regis healthcare carnival cruises

367
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,120
and all be hit by these types of gangs

368
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,160
and in september we've seen equinix

369
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,920
already

370
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,040
and everybody's fear what everyone's

371
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:01,199
asking at the moment is could we be next

372
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,959
and and for a lot of organizations

373
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,200
unfortunately the answer is you very

374
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:08,560
well could be

375
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:12,720
um what is interesting is there's this

376
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,719
um idea we don't know how many people

377
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,480
pay these ransoms there's no accurate

378
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,839
statistics and realistically the only

379
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:20,160
people that can tell us

380
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,920
how many people pay and how much they

381
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,560
pay are the attackers themselves and

382
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,880
they're not come

383
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,839
forthcoming on that type of information

384
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,399
uh i've heard as much as 70 percent of

385
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,639
people

386
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,320
are paying ransoms which again seems

387
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,160
very high to me

388
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,720
um but what we do know is a lot of

389
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,000
organizations are paying

390
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,760
and if we actually go back to this the

391
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,199
ones that i've highlighted in red are

392
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,319
the ones that we know that they've

393
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,079
they've paid

394
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,600
um often there's a clue that an

395
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:47,359
organization whether they

396
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,279
divulge how much they've paid or what

397
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,199
they've paid often there's a clue

398
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,720
because the information will disappear

399
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,719
from the leak sites

400
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:57,680
and this is interesting with equinix as

401
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,440
equinix got hit by the networker crew

402
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,279
and there is no information about

403
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,199
equinix on networkers

404
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:05,040
leak site at the moment which is an

405
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,639
indication that they're probably in

406
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,000
negotiations to pay

407
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,160
which doesn't mean that they will pay

408
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,360
they might just be stalling for time

409
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,279
uh but but it's hard to hide the fact

410
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,480
that you've paid if you if you indeed

411
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,720
pay

412
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,560
so to the question of is it even legal

413
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,720
to pay a ransom in australia

414
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,319
um now this comes up an awful lot and

415
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,680
i've heard lots of people saying this

416
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,480
and it's taken me a while to

417
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,880
to to actually find the legislation that

418
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,800
people are kind of alluded to

419
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,279
and what we have is the criminal code

420
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,240
act of 1995 which is commonwealth law in

421
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,079
australia

422
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,440
and it basically says it's a serious

423
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,800
criminal offence if a person deals with

424
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,240
money or property where there's a risk

425
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,839
the money or property will become an

426
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,399
instrument of crime

427
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,839
so what it says in legal speak is if you

428
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,519
give money to someone

429
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,839
and you have a reasonable expectation

430
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,880
that they will use that money

431
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,120
to to commit a crime then

432
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,240
that is a serious criminal offence which

433
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,920
means that

434
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,079
where the argument can be made that

435
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,000
attackers are going to reinvest

436
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,920
the money that you give them into

437
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,240
getting better at attacking people which

438
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:11,680
is almost certainly what we've seen

439
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:16,079
then then there is a big problem

440
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:18,719
however what the attackers have quite

441
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,800
probably unwittingly but fortunately

442
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:23,040
done for themselves is by switching to

443
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,519
this attack of double extortion which is

444
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,639
this added threat while we will release

445
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,560
your data

446
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,959
and that will result in embarrassment to

447
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:34,239
your customers and the leak to those

448
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,839
personal um the the the the

449
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,839
that personal information becoming

450
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,600
public now you have what's called the

451
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,320
defense of duress and the defense of

452
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,800
duress

453
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,600
is a legal instrument by which if you

454
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,279
believe

455
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,120
reasonably believe that the threat will

456
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,639
be carried out unless an offence is

457
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,920
committed

458
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,839
and there's no reasonable way that a

459
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:53,839
threat can be rendered ineffective

460
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:56,079
then then you're allowed to make that

461
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,399
payment and it's a bit like saying well

462
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,000
um you know if someone's holding a gun

463
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,720
to your head then then you can break the

464
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,639
law and

465
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,399
this is effectively now from a legal

466
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,759
standpoint you've got someone holding

467
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,519
that gun to your head so i

468
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,120
i'm not a lawyer don't take this as

469
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,800
legal advice but

470
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,560
the um the the the often throw away line

471
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,359
that it's not legal to pay a ransom in

472
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,599
australia

473
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,839
um or or indeed anywhere in the world it

474
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:23,120
is probably uh is probably moots

475
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,720
given the this change intact so what i

476
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,120
talked about so far is

477
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,199
those attacks affecting australians in

478
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,480
general so australian organizations or

479
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,519
australian customers of those

480
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:33,519
organizations

481
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,959
if we zoom out a little bit and find out

482
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,759
what else has been going on

483
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:38,160
in these recent months and i found a

484
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:40,320
chat

485
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,240
on twitter called dark tracer i'm

486
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,519
assuming dark tracer is his handle

487
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,639
rather than a bit of nominated

488
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,800
determinism

489
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,399
and he kindly allowed me to use the

490
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,560
spreadsheet he's published on twitter

491
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,600
which is an analysis that he's done

492
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:56,079
of about 514 separate attacks

493
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,000
which are broken down by 14 prominent

494
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,920
groups or gangs

495
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,120
it's not just this year this is this is

496
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,319
dates back a little bit

497
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,760
but you can see it's a prolific problem

498
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,480
now unfortunately for me the spreadsheet

499
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,559
this guy

500
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,880
shared was in the form of a jpeg so i

501
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:14,639
had a fair bit of work to do to ocr

502
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,799
and turn it into a something i can

503
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,880
analyze but for you guys i went ahead

504
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,439
and did that and this is essentially

505
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:21,280
what i

506
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,640
what i came up with and you can see from

507
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,079
this um

508
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,839
again this is not just limited to

509
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,559
australian organizations this is kind of

510
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,240
globally

511
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,840
but you can see that the maze group has

512
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,640
been very busy

513
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,039
and i went and had a look at the these

514
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,480
top

515
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:37,039
top of the you know the the top eight or

516
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,600
nine

517
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,240
groups and looked at what the attack

518
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,039
vector

519
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:44,960
that was being reported as them you know

520
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,400
how were they doing this

521
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,559
and you start to see some common

522
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,720
patterns so spear phishing

523
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,799
and brute forcing and password spray

524
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,760
attacks against rdp

525
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,240
lots of vulnerabilities against things

526
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,360
like

527
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,520
vpn technology um

528
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,600
well-known bugs we're not talking about

529
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:06,000
zero days

530
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,000
we're talking about macros vbs within

531
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,840
word documents all kind of commoner

532
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,960
garden things

533
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:14,959
however as we've got not gone on

534
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,640
and we've started to see big payments

535
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,720
being made and we've started to see

536
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:19,200
these organizations reinvesting in their

537
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,520
people

538
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,919
and their capabilities we're starting to

539
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,679
see an uplift in those capabilities

540
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,840
and now more more than ever we're

541
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,840
starting to see use of tools like cobalt

542
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:33,280
strike or powershell empire

543
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,439
which are really that they're considered

544
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,600
pen testing tools they're not dissimilar

545
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,000
from the tool sets that we're using to

546
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,639
to carry out penetration testing which

547
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,799
means that

548
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:44,960
there's a folly in thinking about this

549
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:48,160
in terms of well as long as i close my

550
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,919
rdp and i patch these seven issues that

551
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,799
i've read about in the newspapers i'm

552
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,640
good

553
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:55,600
um they will if if they target you as an

554
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,280
organization

555
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,559
they will use whatever vulnerability

556
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,160
they can find to get into that

557
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,000
organization

558
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,600
and and i'll dig down into a little bit

559
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,320
more how i think that

560
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,120
that works uh i talked about league

561
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:09,600
sites

562
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,439
um so there's heaps of them i there's 13

563
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,240
groups that i know of that have leaked

564
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,039
sites

565
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,799
and they're all relatively easy to find

566
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,760
if you if you care to go looking for

567
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,440
them

568
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,440
and this is kind of what they look for

569
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:25,200
look like they look like

570
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:26,240
relatively uh websites this is clock

571
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,480
leaks

572
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,919
this is the famous rival happy blog this

573
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,880
is an organization

574
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,360
whose um information has been uploaded

575
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,840
um they're in clarence street in sydney

576
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:39,360
and this is doppelhamer this is the the

577
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,720
maze group

578
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,479
as a little bit more polished and they

579
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,919
actually service on that on the clearweb

580
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,960
as well as on the uh

581
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:49,280
as well as on the dark web um

582
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,160
now because maze came the top of that

583
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,080
list uh

584
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,520
40 of those attacks i thought it'd be

585
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:56,960
interesting to have a look at

586
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:59,120
maze as an organization i read a lot of

587
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,520
opinion by journalists about the size of

588
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:04,080
maze and how it worked and

589
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,960
and um they were beginning to describe

590
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,480
them as a cartel and we're starting to

591
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,600
see other crews

592
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,760
upload their leaks to maze so maize

593
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,199
almost are acting as a clearinghouse for

594
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,919
other attackers

595
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,679
who don't have the either the appetite

596
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,360
for risk to run their own leak site or

597
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,799
the expertise

598
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,479
because obviously running a leak site

599
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,760
brings an awful lot of heat on you as an

600
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,360
organization

601
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:29,039
and i kind of i thought well i run a

602
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,479
team of pen testers

603
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:33,039
and and security people if i was given a

604
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,120
job

605
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:37,039
to compromise the number of companies

606
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,320
that we've seen or pen test the number

607
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,960
of companies that we've seen

608
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,320
compromised how many people would i need

609
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,880
in the time that they've had

610
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,559
to do what they've done and i thought

611
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,600
i'd do a little bit of modeling

612
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,039
and know what you're thinking looking at

613
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,559
my cheekbones obviously modelling is

614
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,200
something that comes as second nature to

615
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,399
me

616
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:56,480
um so so here's what i came up with so

617
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,080
based on the first attack that we saw on

618
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,039
the 29th of may

619
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:03,918
and taking it up to the 31st of august

620
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,679
this year and there were 460 days

621
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,440
and if we assume they work five days a

622
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,000
week and have weekends off and have

623
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,880
holidays and that kind of time and there

624
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,240
was 211 successful attacks and not

625
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,400
successful in terms of

626
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,320
yielding a ransom payment but successful

627
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,440
in terms of exfiltrating data from those

628
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,360
organizations

629
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,360
i came up with a number of about 10 and

630
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:26,000
a half days per attack

631
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,520
which is basically this was my breakdown

632
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,679
so if i say it's

633
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,600
time lost to unsuccessful attacks the

634
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,520
selection the compromise the lateral

635
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,240
movement the exfiltration the upload is

636
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,879
off the bottom of the screen

637
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,360
unfortunately

638
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,400
but i i worked out on you know based on

639
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,320
my sort of scoping

640
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,159
finger in the windy uh about ten and a

641
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,760
half days and

642
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:48,799
roughly 0.5 um you know half 50

643
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:52,400
um success ratio that gave me a total

644
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:54,400
effort of 2 215 and a half days

645
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,520
uh and if i assume people are working

646
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,919
around 80

647
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,158
utilization which is more than roughly

648
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:02,960
the sweet spot for this type of

649
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:05,280
um activity i predicted they would need

650
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,760
only about 21 people to do what they've

651
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,320
done

652
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,158
but now consider that if you look at

653
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:13,600
this through a startup

654
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:15,679
security lens organizations don't start

655
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,120
up with 21 people and run at 21 people

656
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,640
they start up with one person who

657
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,678
recruits someone else and and then it

658
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,480
kind of grows in the

659
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:24,240
in this sort of long curve and if you

660
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,000
look at it through that lens

661
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,520
or the growth of a typical startup you

662
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,840
actually get to a number

663
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:31,039
that's around about 45 people at the

664
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,199
current time

665
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,879
now you can't run a criminal enterprise

666
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,159
with 45 people sitting in an office

667
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,000
banging away at computers

668
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,080
because if any one of those people gets

669
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:41,760
arrested they will get you know you know

670
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,320
for anything like speeding

671
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,840
um and they're not already on you know

672
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,360
first name terms with the police

673
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,360
they will get turned and used against

674
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,959
the other members of the gang

675
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,520
so the epiphany i had was that this

676
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,080
organization looks a lot more like a

677
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,960
bounty organization like bug crowd or

678
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,120
hacker one

679
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,080
than it does a traditional pen testing

680
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,320
organization

681
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,918
and the and what they have is a bunch of

682
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,840
back office systems like

683
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,600
the the people running the leak site the

684
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,959
people selecting the targets the people

685
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:11,520
developing the malware

686
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:13,360
crypt crypto malware that gets deployed

687
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:15,440
and then they have what they refer to as

688
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,280
affiliates who are almost freelancers

689
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:19,039
who are free to choose whatever tooling

690
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:21,440
whatever skills whatever

691
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,559
um trick shots they have to deploy this

692
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,000
malware

693
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,000
and they will be given a list of

694
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,559
organizations that have selected based

695
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,640
on

696
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:30,639
you know that zoom info reconnaissance

697
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,320
these are the organizations you would

698
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,919
you will go and target they may even be

699
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,720
given an industry vertical

700
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,440
or a geographic location and they will

701
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,000
go

702
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:41,520
and find the vulnerability get into the

703
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,720
organization

704
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:47,600
let move laterally deploy the malware um

705
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,480
you know have the ransomware demand pop

706
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,799
up on the screen

707
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,000
and then and the data then gets sent to

708
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,639
the parent

709
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,360
organization who then publish and handle

710
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,440
the

711
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,279
communications the negotiations and the

712
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,400
support if the organization

713
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:04,960
pays up and this is generally generally

714
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:08,240
how i think this works

715
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:11,120
um i was going to dig down into revel

716
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,799
and how that what their story was i'll

717
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,199
gloss over it quite quickly because of

718
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:15,360
uh

719
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,480
time constraints but essentially what

720
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,918
happened with revel

721
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:20,480
and rival were the guys that popped

722
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,000
travelex the first time and lion in

723
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,440
australia

724
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
in march they popped a organization in

725
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:29,440
the u.s called 10x genomics

726
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,200
and that was an organization that was

727
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,440
doing research into kovic 19

728
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,880
and that drew an awful lot of ire

729
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:38,400
against them as a team

730
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:41,679
from the um other

731
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,799
um cyber criminals on the xxx forum with

732
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,600
excesses forum which is a

733
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:47,279
russian-speaking cyber crime forum

734
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,039
because an awful lot of the ransomware

735
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,640
crews had made quite bold statements

736
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,679
that they were not going to touch

737
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,919
hospitals

738
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,799
and organizations doing that kind of

739
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,159
research

740
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,158
and a lot of organizations have

741
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,720
published statements on their leak sites

742
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,559
saying

743
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,760
we will not target hospitals and if you

744
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:03,360
are a hospital

745
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,279
or you're working in this space and you

746
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,479
do get ransomware we will give you the

747
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:10,080
keys for free

748
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:13,039
so so reeval kind of really um

749
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,080
pushed against the the tide with this uh

750
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:16,320
and that that that

751
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,199
i uh extended to a guy called viva la

752
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,279
muerte

753
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,880
who was who began extorting rivals

754
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:22,880
saying that he was going to dox them and

755
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,880
release their identities

756
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,559
which all tied back to some bad bad

757
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,400
blood that he had with the leader of the

758
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:29,600
rival group over some work he'd done

759
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,039
developing malware that

760
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:35,439
he felt he hadn't been paid for um

761
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,960
so rival rather than backing off and

762
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,400
lying low for a little bit

763
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,000
what they do is they go and hack an

764
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,279
organization called grub and shy

765
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,480
mozallas and sachs

766
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,240
which is the law firm to the stars every

767
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,720
famous person in the us you've ever

768
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:50,640
heard of from donald trump to u2 to

769
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,279
bruce springsteen madonna

770
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:54,400
you name it um who worked with this law

771
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:56,559
law firm

772
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,000
um suddenly realized that a lot of the

773
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,600
information they'd been pro

774
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,600
client privilege information that this

775
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,000
law firm had had been released

776
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,840
and it's estimated that they exfiltrated

777
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,320
a terabyte of information

778
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,959
and then issued a 21 million dollar

779
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,960
demand

780
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:16,720
to the um alan grubman who ran this

781
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:19,440
law firm and then just for fun released

782
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,279
all of the data pertaining to lady gaga

783
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,480
as a proof of life to show this is what

784
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:25,520
we have

785
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,720
and of course grubman um wasn't going to

786
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,960
hand over 20

787
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,400
21 million dollars and made this very

788
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,080
bold statement saying

789
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,120
we're not going to pay you because

790
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,600
you're probably going to release the

791
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,320
data

792
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,799
anyway and we've been told by the fbi

793
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,520
not to

794
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,559
that negotiating um with terrorists as a

795
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,480
violation of

796
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,600
federal criminal law so he was implying

797
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,279
that the fbi

798
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:49,120
had branded um real terrorists

799
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:50,320
um the fbi have since kind of rolled

800
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,918
that back and said not really

801
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,439
they're not terrorists which is which is

802
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:55,360
probably good to hear

803
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,440
but in response to grubman telling them

804
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,439
to go and shove it

805
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:00,960
they basically increased the ransom to

806
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,760
42 million dollars

807
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,799
and then pivoted to that ransom to

808
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,879
donald trump

809
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,879
and said we have a load of embarrassing

810
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,400
dirty laundry on on you and if you want

811
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,600
to win the next election

812
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,559
you should you should pay up um and then

813
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,959
they released a

814
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,799
a bunch of information around trump to

815
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,799
prove that they had information backdrop

816
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,200
which all turned out to be completely

817
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:26,240
harmless nonsense

818
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,000
and then what we see is the the other um

819
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,440
members of the forum just calling them

820
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,120
out for bluffing

821
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,960
um and they then not not disconcerted

822
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,439
double down and hack another law firm

823
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,960
and they're still going um you'd think

824
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:40,559
they'd lie low or come back as a

825
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,720
different name but there

826
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,918
they hit jack daniels recently and

827
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,440
they're still trying to auction off

828
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:48,880
madonna's information on the

829
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:50,480
on the dark web um how are we going for

830
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:54,159
time

831
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:57,120
are we good um this is maxim jacobet's

832
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:58,960
um leader of the evil corp very high

833
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,879
ties into the fsb in russia so

834
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,240
untouchable which is why he's able to do

835
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,520
donuts around police station

836
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:08,559
in his urban camo lamborghini

837
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,760
um carlson wagon lit travel case i

838
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:12,559
talked about earlier

839
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,320
this was interesting because there is a

840
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,960

841
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,520
online

842
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,240
where there's this very very cordial

843
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,440
discussion

844
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:24,960
with carlson and the ragnar locker guys

845
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:27,360
negotiating the price and it's all very

846
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,919
very collegiate and cordial which is

847
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,080
absurd given the context of it

848
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:33,520
but what you realize is that these guys

849
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,520
genuinely think they are

850
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,799
kind of robin hood characters robbing

851
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,158
from the rich and giving to the poor

852
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,279
that's kind of how they're squaring it

853
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,919
in their mind

854
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:43,279
um what they finally wind up with for

855
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,440
four and a half million dollars

856
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,440
is the most expensive penetration test

857
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,240
report in the history of infosec

858
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,840
which is here um which is clearly hasn't

859
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:53,840
been peer reviewed and and

860
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,120
not something we would send out i'll dig

861
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,039
into that in a little bit

862
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:59,360
uh but yeah pat's on the back all round

863
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:02,960
what a great professional

864
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:04,959
you've been august we see tesla

865
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,320
which is a complete botched job but

866
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:10,159
according to the filing

867
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:11,760
this handsome chap here walks into a bar

868
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:14,000
somewhere in the states and has a beer

869
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,240
with a tesla employer offers him

870
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,679
somewhere between half a mill and a mill

871
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,399
in bitcoin to exist

872
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:22,240
to to assist in a ransomware attack so

873
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,399
go to work and open an email

874
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,919
um the interesting part of the filing

875
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,719
which is fascinating if you read it is

876
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:29,919
that the plan

877
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:31,840
includes a discussion around

878
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:34,399
the attackers running a denial of

879
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,600
service attack at the same time as he's

880
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,918
planning the ransomware

881
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,439
as a distraction which is the first time

882
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,320
i've ever heard about this being

883
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,880
discussed

884
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:44,879
in a real world context outside of you

885
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,679
know it's a common trope in academic

886
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,440
papers that

887
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,720
attackers always do a denial of service

888
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,200
attack is distraction

889
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,840
never actually heard about it happening

890
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,799
but this

891
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,559
this was was discussed in the filing

892
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,360
which leads me to suspect they might not

893
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:00,240
actually be

894
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:01,918
a very competent crew i don't know um

895
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,520
igor if you're listening my advice is to

896
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:04,559
pop a condom on your nose and a box on

897
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,080
your head and put some

898
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,360
grow beard and put some curlers in it

899
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,080
telling me worried about the radiation

900
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,959
and you'll be home

901
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,399
in time for christmas uh so where to

902
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,000
from here

903
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,120
um what we're going to see so i think

904
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,840
we're going to obviously see more

905
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,439
attacks

906
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,439
they're going to get more sophisticated

907
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,919
we're going to see more mature

908
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,520
organizations getting owned and we're

909
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:25,760
going to read more news about them

910
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:27,520
paying bigger ransom demands

911
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,760
um i think we're going to have to sit

912
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,200
through a lot of boring infosec talks

913
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,279
about the threat of insiders being

914
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,080
bribed or placing jobs

915
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:38,159
um we're going to see more smart devices

916
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,399
services being affected ella garmin

917
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,559
because that was a very effective

918
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:43,760
pain point for that organization and why

919
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,879
garmin paid up so

920
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:48,158
10 million reportedly so quickly because

921
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,520
people's watches stopped working and

922
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,200
they weren't happy

923
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,200
and i think we'll see insurance

924
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,880
companies changing their language about

925
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,480
the idea of payments

926
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,640
there's definitely been some anecdotal

927
00:30:56,480 --> 00:31:01,679
stories today where insurance companies

928
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:04,240
have insisted that organizations pay

929
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:06,159
the ransom because by getting the

930
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:08,720
organization to pay the ransom

931
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,720
the insurance company kind of absolves

932
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,679
itself for having to pay for the cleanup

933
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,919
which as you've seen

934
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,440
from the examples i've shown is a lot

935
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,840
more than the cost of the ransom so if

936
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,840
the

937
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,199
insurance company can pay the ransom

938
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,799
they can wash their hands and let the

939
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,000
organization finance the

940
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,080
the following the cleanup and the

941
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:25,919
forensics and the so on and so forth

942
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,840
um i think we'll see more suggestion of

943
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,960
ties to government so where these crews

944
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,959
are being

945
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,159
caught they will get turned and used for

946
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,080
the for the

947
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,519
government's uh the government in charge

948
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,760
of zanes potentially

949
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,440
i think we might see some fbi takedowns

950
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,039
of some of these leaked sites

951
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,200
which i think could lead to some turf

952
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,720
wars or amalgamation i'd be interesting

953
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,000
to see what the traditional organized

954
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,640
crime gangs view on this

955
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,159
they must be side eyeing ransomware as a

956
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:52,240
way to a much easier

957
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,600
way to make money because it's starting

958
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,279
to surpass the

959
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,519
drugs trade in terms of the amount of

960
00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:00,480
money that's being made

961
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:02,480
and if we do see the fbi taking down and

962
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:04,399
arresting and extracting these people

963
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:06,799
i think that vacuum is likely to be

964
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:08,799
filled by even more aggressive and less

965
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,879
honorable rival style attackers who

966
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:14,000
haven't really got any um

967
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,679
any ethics digging down

968
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,120
into this you know i wanted to end on

969
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,360
what you do about this

970
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:21,279
uh digging down into ragnar's pen test

971
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,600
for cwt

972
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:25,440
in security language or consulting

973
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,840
language what this eventually translates

974
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,960
to is use a gpo to roll out some decent

975
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:31,600
policies for your

976
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,279
local machines update everybody's

977
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,320
password won't force everyone to update

978
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:37,120
their password once

979
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,320
once a month which i think is probably

980
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,279
probably one of the more painful

981
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:42,080
recommendations i

982
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:43,919
i'd be paying to make and adopt the

983
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,000
concept of least privilege

984
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,000
something we put on a lot of our reports

985
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,320
do application whitelisting

986
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,919
yeah easier said than done but but it

987
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,879
goes a long way to help this

988
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,399
uh an av is so 2000 go and get adr and

989
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,799
an mssp so all the stuff at the end

990
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,959
where

991
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:01,200
where they're talking about we suggest

992
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,600
at least three system admins working 24

993
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,200
hours

994
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,799
four admins working three shifts for

995
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,080
eight hours a day what they're talking

996
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,039
about there they don't realize it but

997
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,158
they're talking about an

998
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:11,840
outsourced managed sock solution

999
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:14,559
which which will go a long way to defeat

1000
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,959
this uh my recommendations

1001
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:17,760
is apart from all of those things is

1002
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:21,360
number one

1003
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:23,519
don't let this be you the cost of um

1004
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,279
you know prevention has just got a lot

1005
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,480
better than cure because of this

1006
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:30,399
specter of data being leaked um

1007
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,399
you know you could you could ask your

1008
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,000
favorite infosec consultant to give you

1009
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:35,360
some kind of ransomware readiness

1010
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,720
assessment we're doing a lot of work in

1011
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,559
that space at the moment

1012
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,760
essentially using things like the nist

1013
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,440
csf to

1014
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,240
to show that your bases are covered

1015
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,919
comprehensively um it's not just about

1016
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,640
prevention you do need to think about

1017
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,960
what happens

1018
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,360
if if this does happen to you

1019
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:52,159
multi-factor authentication on all the

1020
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,039
things

1021
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:56,720
do not expose rdp do not put up with

1022
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,519
people who argue that they can secure

1023
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,159
rdp

1024
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,919
it can be done but it's so hard and

1025
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,440
we're seeing so many successful attacks

1026
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,679
through that vector

1027
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,960
patch and scan your ip your public ip

1028
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:09,599
space regularly for

1029
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,280
valve vaults or mis configurations don't

1030
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:13,200
have a situation where

1031
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,800
an unpatched box can sit on the internet

1032
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,598
for three months because nobody realized

1033
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:17,200
that

1034
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,679
there was already any any rule on the

1035
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:22,239
firewall use a secure email gateway

1036
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,480
don't rely on office 365 to filter

1037
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,520
you know an e3 license to filter malware

1038
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:28,960
coming in

1039
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,280
and get an ir team or an ir retainer

1040
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,960
sorted out if you can and obviously get

1041
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,720
good offline backups

1042
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,320
but remember backup is not your silver

1043
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:38,560
bullet and

1044
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,240
number two have a crisis management plan

1045
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,480
for this and drill for it

1046
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:43,598
so think about not just how you recover

1047
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,599
this information

1048
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:46,800
but think about comm's plans think about

1049
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:50,560
the legal people

1050
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:52,320
think about um notifiable data breach

1051
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,599
and i say to organizations have a

1052
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,599
diverse crisis

1053
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,079
management team don't just have a load

1054
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:01,520
of middle-aged white guys in a room

1055
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:03,119
who will think the same way get get a a

1056
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,720
diverse team and that's when you start

1057
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,760
to really get some some good thinking

1058
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,799
around the stuff

1059
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,040
and run some tabletop exercises um

1060
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,040
and go through the the thought process

1061
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,040
of what happens if you decide early on

1062
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,480
the payment is actually an option that

1063
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,320
you want to negotiate

1064
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:20,240
that you that if you do want to make a

1065
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,599
payment how do you do that

1066
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:25,598
um don't pay obviously standard advice

1067
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:26,880
but if you must pay if you if you want

1068
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:28,720
to go down that road

1069
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,480
make sure you negotiate and make sure

1070
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,200
you are courteous and professional to

1071
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,880
the attackers

1072
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,960
because they will burn you if they sent

1073
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:38,160
you you're messing around or you're

1074
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,760
or you're not respecting them have a

1075
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,680
comms plan in place

1076
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,760
and understand the nuances around good

1077
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:46,078
and bad comms and lastly

1078
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:47,680
get insurance and read the small print

1079
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,160
make sure you're covered before you need

1080
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,279
it

1081
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,040
so final slide really parting shot i

1082
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,480
talked about using the nist cyber

1083
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:56,160
security framework

1084
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,560
i realized as i got to the end of this

1085
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:02,319
attack that there is a really

1086
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,320
obvious part of the the csf missing

1087
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,160
and i'm going to propose this for the

1088
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,440
next version of the csf which is the

1089
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:09,118
addition of revenge

1090
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,960
so this is where you get to stimulate

1091
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,400
remorse by telling the attack as a

1092
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,160
horrible sob story

1093
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,520
and you get to burn their their

1094
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,960
techniques and their hashes and their

1095
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,920
files upload everything you can to

1096
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:20,320
virustotal

1097
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,119
to make them work harder hack back if

1098
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,240
you've got the

1099
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,240
if you've got the means and the

1100
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,078
resources don't hack back uh

1101
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:27,680
deploy deception technology collaborate

1102
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,240
with your peers share your message

1103
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,640
and your lessons learned and just don't

1104
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:36,640
yeah it's cathartic to to not get

1105
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:39,680
um no not get hacked

1106
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,440
and that's me

1107
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,960
questions if we have any right here we

1108
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,520
go how do we see the targets getting

1109
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:46,720
smarter

1110
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,400
the organizations that are getting

1111
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,000
smarter are the ones that are looking at

1112
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,800
you know looking at their

1113
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,440
peer organizations getting owned and

1114
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:58,240
taking this seriously and investing in

1115
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,640
proper cyber security uh you know if you

1116
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,479
do

1117
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,920
the the reality is if you do all the

1118
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,640
basics right

1119
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:06,400
you you quickly get to a point where the

1120
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,000
attackers will move on after a few days

1121
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,760
of not being successful and

1122
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,920
getting it getting that right is things

1123
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:13,920
like you know the essential a

1124
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:15,520
the application white listing good

1125
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,920
awareness training

1126
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,079
not having exposed rdp that hasn't been

1127
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:22,240
patched in in three years

1128
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:25,359
um i will share the slides but i'll need

1129
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,560
to turn them into a pdf and and and

1130
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,598
did you give them about a little bit

1131
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,279
otherwise you'll just get a lot of

1132
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,680
unreadable slides

1133
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:33,359
uh what i see is the insurance company

1134
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,359
incentive for payment of the ransom

1135
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,560
in short what i'm saying is if a if

1136
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,078
you're on the hook

1137
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,839
so cyber insurance has been through this

1138
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,400
weird life cycle where

1139
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,040
um it's it was seen as a really

1140
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,400
burgeoning

1141
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,040
way to make money for the insurance

1142
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:48,800
companies and they didn't really i don't

1143
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,560
believe they really had the same

1144
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,640
empirical actuarial data to make

1145
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,359
decisions so what they did is they set a

1146
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,799
number

1147
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:56,960
to see what would happen so that they

1148
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,880
could collect some data and ended up

1149
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,240
making a lot of big payouts for a lot of

1150
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:02,880
organizations

1151
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,078
and they didn't want it to be the

1152
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,920
discussion to be

1153
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:07,599
i spent money on cyber insurance and

1154
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:09,359
then the cyber insurance company

1155
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,760
weaseled out of paying because it turned

1156
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:12,160
out

1157
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,200
i had an unpatched xp box on the

1158
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,440
internet

1159
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:17,520
um and i think what the insurance

1160
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,119
company have you know i see insurance

1161
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:20,480
through a cynical view which is

1162
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:22,079
the first thing an insurance company

1163
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,599
will do when you try and put in a claim

1164
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,599
is try and

1165
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:26,720
you know adjust that claim or weasel out

1166
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,400
of paying it for some

1167
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,240
well you know yeah you shouldn't have

1168
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:32,720
been i'm not going to pay for

1169
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,560
your vehicle to be fixed because your

1170
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,520
driver's license expired by one day and

1171
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,680
therefore you shouldn't have been

1172
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,680
driving therefore it's not our fault

1173
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,200
and i think one of the ways they've

1174
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:43,040
realized they can do that

1175
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,799
is if if you think about an organization

1176
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:47,759
with a 56

1177
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,800
000 ransom where it ends up costing 20

1178
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,440
million dollars

1179
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,160
to repair or recover from that run some

1180
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,440
demand

1181
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,040
if the insurance company can pay the

1182
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,400
ransom then they can stand back and say

1183
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,160
well all of the other costs

1184
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,640
are yours we've we've fulfilled our

1185
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,040
obligation whereas if you can then

1186
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:04,720
if you don't pay the ransom and you sit

1187
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,240
back and you spend 20 million dollars

1188
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,520
recovering and then you can say well

1189
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,359
this is our loss

1190
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,040
make me whole then they're potentially

1191
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,920
on the hook again i'm not an insurance

1192
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,440
person

1193
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:17,520
um i i'm not an expert in that field

1194
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,960
but i certainly think we'll stop seeing

1195
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,599
hearing stories where insurance

1196
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,440
companies

1197
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,960
have insisted the organization's paid

1198
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,119
the ransom which is certainly something

1199
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,720
i've heard

1200
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:29,200
fantastic thanks for that eric um

1201
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:33,200
clearly we're running a bit behind now

1202
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,200
so thank you that was really good to

1203
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,560
hear
