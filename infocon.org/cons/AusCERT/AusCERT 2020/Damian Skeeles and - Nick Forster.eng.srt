1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,039
hey guys welcome back uh next up we've

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,080
got damian from proofpoint and nick from

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,680
the missing link

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,200
uh so damian's been in the industry for

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,559
about 20 years now

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,399
and he's got experience across

7
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,399
networking email security

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,440
scenes cloud security the whole works

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,279
and nick is

10
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,880
a security architect with a background

11
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,680
in specialist counter intelligence

12
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,960
operations

13
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,119
and was previously part of the

14
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,840
management team at uh

15
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:27,198
the soccer facebook so interesting stuff

16
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,720
uh they're going to be talking about how

17
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,240
the threat landscapes have changed since

18
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,880
the pandemic that's pretty topical as

19
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,600
well

20
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:35,440
um nick i think you're leading first

21
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,079
when you're ready

22
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,079
take it from there

23
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,839
cool thank you very much cheers man

24
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,398
cool all right so yeah yeah no thank you

25
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,120
thank you very much um

26
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,079
very much for the introduction as uh as

27
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,199
as

28
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:00,399
you heard um the presentation will be by

29
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,839
myself and damian the the kind of uh

30
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,920
the the way it's gonna be structured is

31
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,840
is almost in in in three parts

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,280
and so they'll be myself it kicks off

33
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,119
just to give a bit of an update

34
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,439
overview of the current threat landscape

35
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,200
um in a couple of deals there then i'm

36
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,798
going to move into more of a

37
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,600
um you know how you actually set up a

38
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,920
program or insider threat programmer um

39
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,960
for

40
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,880
or an organization and be it small large

41
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,479
enterprise government you know i've

42
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,640
tried to make it as scalable and

43
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,600
as kind of agnostic in terms of industry

44
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,759
as possible

45
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,759
um and then we'll go through that kind

46
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,079
of methodology that framework and then

47
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,360
um then damien's gonna um gonna jump in

48
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,079
with some you know

49
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,479
specific use cases and kind of you know

50
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,839
the

51
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,320
the kind of proof point technologies

52
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,640
that can you really really support

53
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,079
an insider threat program um program

54
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,200
well

55
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,839
so jumping in um you know as uh as a

56
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,000
kind of

57
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,640
uh okay uh i'll look as to how 2020 has

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,240
gone i don't

59
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,079
we don't need to label the point that

60
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,960
obviously um infrastructure

61
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,839
operations everything about business has

62
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,679
changed

63
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,080
um and kind of every site so every ism's

64
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,160
um

65
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,440
one to three year plan is pretty much

66
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:13,280
kind of uh

67
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,480
slowly cl you know hanging on by a

68
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,080
thread um

69
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:21,440
so uh we you know i

70
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,080
you do you do kind of see um see changes

71
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,840
and and

72
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,760
certainly from a kind of consultant

73
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,720
perspective constantly getting clients

74
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,079
that are

75
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,760
just saying you know feel like they're

76
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,440
losing their losing their grip

77
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,359
on on the kind of security controls and

78
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,440
technologies that they've kind of

79
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,400
they've put in place um in prep one

80
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,959
thing that is

81
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,040
uh is notable and certainly you know on

82
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:43,760
the rise is that increased number of

83
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,640
of end points um increased number of

84
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,679
endpoints across

85
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,799
across the organization um increased

86
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,920
or a requirement of access to um to your

87
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,720
applications for those remote workers as

88
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,760
well as kind of

89
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:01,120
that introduction of um of shadow it be

90
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,599
actual devices byod devices or or or

91
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,800
cloud

92
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,480
and cloud services what have you

93
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,920
another thing you know it will certainly

94
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,480
um certainly go into a little bit more

95
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,440
detail

96
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,040
is that um the increased risk and how

97
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,800
you actually manage privileged access

98
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,519
and your privileged users

99
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,159
and while they're remote as well as um

100
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,640
just you know

101
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,760
missing that kind of uh or the change in

102
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,640
the fact that onboarding

103
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,640
and and and the training and and kind of

104
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,958
awareness programs that you run

105
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,079
um aren't are no longer in person now

106
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,239
and you know

107
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,120
getting that outreach to um to remote

108
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,400
employees

109
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,360
um is is difficult and then finally

110
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,840
um it is a i suppose a difficult topic

111
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,640
um

112
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:43,519
a difficult topic um for everyone but

113
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,559
there has been

114
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,239
kind of uh you know um severances

115
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,400
and a variety of different um either

116
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,400
redundancies or kind of um

117
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,560
being furloughed as a result of um

118
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,239
operations and reduction in revenue

119
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,319
and that obviously does bring its own

120
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,439
risks with them with employees either

121
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:02,319
departing or potentially um departing if

122
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:06,640
they see that

123
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,640
kind of risk in the foreseeable future

124
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,880
sorry i just get cool

125
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,759
so what you know what actually are

126
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,238
insider threats

127
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,840
now proof point and and certainly um

128
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,799
certainly ourselves classify

129
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,679
insider threats as um in three different

130
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,280
categories

131
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,680
there's um negligence there's malicious

132
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,840
and then there's compromise all you know

133
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,639
very different there is some kind of um

134
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,840
permanent permutation between the two in

135
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:40,160
some cases certainly in the

136
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,919
the malicious and compromised and but

137
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,960
you know really really critical to to

138
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,120
define these

139
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,719
um as kind of separate and separate

140
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,360
entities and i think we're really

141
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,680
interested in

142
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,639
um you know negligence or just

143
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,639
accidental

144
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,639
um insider data loss or um or disclosure

145
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,600
does actually kind of account for um

146
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,560
over 62 or around 62 percent of

147
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,320
of incidents um globally linger not with

148
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,960
the actual revenue or or cost of an

149
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,039
incident

150
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,638
average cost of an incident is you know

151
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,880
around 300k

152
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,919
now looking more sp more at the kind of

153
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,080
malicious um

154
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,680
insiders those are there um with

155
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,359
malicious intent

156
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,720
um there are potentially exfol

157
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,080
exfiltrating data

158
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,320
conducting those sabotage and uh

159
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,199
incidents um that that obviously sits

160
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,440
around um

161
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,800
14 of all instances but you can see that

162
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,199
you know the cost of

163
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,240
um cost of those incidents does increase

164
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,240
well you know over

165
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,080
over double if not nearly 300 percent

166
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,440
the um those kind of negligence

167
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,758
and the same the same for those

168
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,160
compromised um compromised users

169
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,280
um that have uh you know their

170
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:52,080
credentials or

171
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:54,320
machines actually um compromised

172
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,840
actually looking at uh i suppose the the

173
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,759
profiling of an insider

174
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,960
and the motivations you know what drives

175
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,520
an insider what

176
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,479
what actually you know how can you um

177
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,120
predict or

178
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,080
identify and those in your organization

179
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,960
that could potentially

180
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,039
be an insider and and i suppose what i'm

181
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,120
what i'm using here is

182
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,280
it's a kind of mnemonic that we used to

183
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,080
use and it's used typically for

184
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,440
offensive

185
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,240
um human um operations and that is

186
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,240
you know how do we how do we um manage

187
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,680
how do we identify potential

188
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,080
um covert human intelligence sources

189
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,759
or or agents and these are typically the

190
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,560
driving factors that you know that we

191
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,880
can use

192
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,479
but what i've kind of done is is you

193
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,319
know circle that back and then put a

194
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,560
blue spin on it so you know how

195
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,840
if this is what um what our insiders are

196
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,319
going to be driven by

197
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,318
how do we kind of identify and protect

198
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,319
protect our organization through

199
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,759
um through kind of um the predictive

200
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,800
analysis or or

201
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:54,639
um identification of these drivers and i

202
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,919
think it's really critical to

203
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,319
firstly identify a a you know a use case

204
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,280
or

205
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,240
an actual motivational driver and

206
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,080
identify

207
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,000
employees that you know are linked to

208
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,639
that and then also identify their

209
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,639
actions

210
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,639
because there is it is a kind of sliding

211
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,199
scale and i've got a couple of examples

212
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:15,360
of

213
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:18,240
of how we can um how we can do that

214
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,520
so we have uh first and foremost you

215
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,400
know straight up front

216
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,758
a disgruntled disgruntled employee now

217
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,479
where you know where roughly is that

218
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,000
going to sit on

219
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:30,560
on this kind of um this matrix and

220
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,759
it could be money related it could be um

221
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,160
ego related

222
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,759
um it tends to it's gonna sit towards

223
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,759
the the kind of top end

224
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,599
and top end within those categories

225
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:42,160
there and actually what are

226
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,000
um what are those uh the kind of use

227
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,720
cases or the actions conducted

228
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,759
by this um the disgruntled employee that

229
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,800
could be

230
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,160
sabotage um it could be a kind of date

231
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,800
or exfiltration

232
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,639
um or or it could just be you know um

233
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,680
poor or a lack of um

234
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,360
a lack of kind of care or or due

235
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,160
diligence with their own with their own

236
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,160
with their own work

237
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,759
so the next one could be a department

238
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,440
employee now

239
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,840
obviously we do have to kind of uh

240
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,560
they it can be linked to disgruntled

241
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,159
employees

242
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,759
but you know as a as a department

243
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,720
employee what you're typically going to

244
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:25,039
have is it is a designated time period

245
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,720
either when a notice has been or

246
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,360
resignation has been submitted

247
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,120
or the the the rumor mill has starred or

248
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,520
there's formal communications gone out

249
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,719
about

250
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,039
um about any kind of severances or um m

251
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,800
a those types of those types of activity

252
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,360
so you are potentially going to get more

253
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,669
of a

254
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,480
more kind of a kind of

255
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:47,600
[Music]

256
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,399
insight or or a kind of indicator of

257
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,800
a potential use case but still it's

258
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,399
going to

259
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,160
it's going to look at department

260
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,440
employee could be eager

261
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,199
because you know they could be um

262
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,240
disaffected as a result it could be

263
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,880
money related

264
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,600
or uh it could be ideology in in a sense

265
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,760
that you know

266
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,040
um they they've kind of lost their lost

267
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,560
their way with their business and and

268
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,480
they are obviously either looking to set

269
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,479
up on their own or um

270
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,640
or move to a move to a competitor

271
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,519
potentially

272
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,000
now again remote workers um we did have

273
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,560
can

274
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,040
have kind of covered off um this in a in

275
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,518
the

276
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,480
at the beginning and but remote remote

277
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,160
workers

278
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,320
and i suppose linking that to to the

279
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,920
next use case that's going to be

280
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,080
potentially more towards you know the

281
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,599
compromise that increased risk of

282
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:34,480
compromised um

283
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,600
users or or or assets as a result of

284
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:39,440
them

285
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,240
utilizing shadow services or not

286
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,640
actually um

287
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:44,080
using the controls web proxies or

288
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,240
gateways or or

289
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,760
um what have you that are are set up to

290
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,279
protect the corporate environment

291
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,800
and so obviously that does that does

292
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,680
bring its own own risks and with

293
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,439
compromise

294
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,880
and the likelihood is it's then going to

295
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,160
be um data

296
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,519
for exfiltration um or potential lateral

297
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,040
movement within the uh

298
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,240
within the environment contractors and

299
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,519
third parties i've got this as a

300
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,440
specific use case for

301
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,640
you know those those industries and

302
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,320
organizations that

303
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:14,640
um that you know do really have strict

304
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,240
um controls or audit requirements on

305
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,360
their third parties

306
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,760
um but also it can be linked to

307
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,560
um you know external or malicious third

308
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,560
parties be it

309
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,760
from a corporate espionage perspective

310
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,880
or a

311
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,279
state or um or kind of uh international

312
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,560
uh kind of um sophisticated foreign

313
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,160
intelligence service or

314
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:38,479
or state-sponsored um actor um and again

315
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,000
typically these that the kind of ladder

316
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,720
of those is going to be linked to um

317
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,079
potentially

318
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,640
um ideology um but also also compromise

319
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,519
through

320
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,079
you know the the kind of um introduction

321
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,040
of

322
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,439
malware or or what have you into into

323
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,680
your

324
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,839
organization but from an actual

325
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,680
contractors or suppliers perspective

326
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,880
again that that risk is really with

327
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,640
compromise from

328
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,240
remote workers gaining access to your

329
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:06,319
critical infrastructure or

330
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,880
or assets and i think one thing that is

331
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,880
often

332
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,880
often overlooked in the last two are

333
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,640
very kind of human-centric

334
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:16,800
um in the sense that um you know not all

335
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,240
not all insider incidents as we said

336
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,640
with the the kind of negligence

337
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,440
um that negligence category are linked

338
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,760
to

339
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,079
malicious activity ultimately it has

340
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,640
been a hard period for everyone

341
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,519
everyone is is kind of uh you know

342
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,120
stresses

343
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,360
on the increase um and it can play and

344
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,880
it

345
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,200
play a part on in people's kind of

346
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,040
day-to-day um operations and and the way

347
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,519
that they go about their business so

348
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,160
um it's definitely one one to be aware

349
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:46,000
of and employee burnout is certainly

350
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,920
certainly something that and should pick

351
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,440
your interest as a as a kind of um

352
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,719
ism or say so and understanding um you

353
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,440
know how that impacts your

354
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,120
your insider insider threat and likely

355
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:00,000
you know likely kind of instance could

356
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:03,760
be configuration or misconfigurations or

357
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:06,399
or you know um mass data exfiltration

358
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,519
accidentally um through through human

359
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,560
error

360
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,440
and also as i said at the beginning it's

361
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,199
harder to for

362
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,440
to get that outreach um in the

363
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,680
onboarding stage with your kind of

364
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,440
continuous um security awareness and

365
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,359
training and programs

366
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,600
so again increased risk of compromise

367
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,079
just because the that effectiveness of

368
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,720
training

369
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,760
can sometimes be reduced um due to um

370
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,760
due to remote working

371
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,040
so now uh i suppose i'm moving on to

372
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,240
onto the framework onto this insider

373
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,439
threat framework and what i've tried to

374
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:40,320
do is create a

375
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,440
or what we we certainly have created as

376
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,639
a scalable

377
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:47,279
and measurable and repeatable process

378
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,800
that you're just a continuous um

379
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,079
continuous cycle

380
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:55,760
and we have uh well first of all

381
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:56,638
um insider threat can often feel it's

382
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,240
very daunting

383
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,839
and it can feel like you know a needle

384
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,120
in a haysack a haystack

385
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,920
there's also a lot of kind of

386
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,839
discussions or concerns around

387
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,839
um you know the ethics behind it or the

388
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,240
morality and and kind of

389
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,040
an individual or employees privacy so

390
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,880
hopefully

391
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,959
what i'll kind of get out during this

392
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,760
this section is kind of covering off

393
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,719
those points

394
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,720
and kind of um

395
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,320
justifying um justifying the kind of

396
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,120
need

397
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,959
um to have an intelligence led and a

398
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,079
risk-based um insider threat

399
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:33,119
um program so starting off with um

400
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:35,680
the identify um in

401
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:37,920
a previous life i was uh i was in a in

402
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:39,599
the military and

403
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,199
we used what was called the combat

404
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,760
combat estimate started with seven

405
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,279
questions

406
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,279
and the first question was always down

407
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,959
to intelligence and it was you know

408
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,360
referred to as question one

409
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,000
used to be um what is the enemy doing

410
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,079
and why

411
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,440
but as we moved into more conventional

412
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:56,800
um conventional

413
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:58,079
kind of operations it changed and this

414
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,000
is this is a question that we were

415
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:02,719
always posed what is the situation

416
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,639
and how does it affect me and and i like

417
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,160
to kind of break this down into into

418
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,480
three distinct parts

419
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,920
so the first one is security

420
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,320
intelligence preparation of your

421
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,360
of your environment or your organization

422
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,920
so you sit down

423
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,639
and think of it like a like a bird table

424
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,000
like a

425
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:24,320
um a kind of map and with

426
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,839
various different um filters or or um

427
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,079
kind of covers over it so you have um

428
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,600
site what are the threats that that's

429
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,479
ultimately what you're answering within

430
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,199
in in this

431
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,680
um in this section um what you know what

432
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,599
what

433
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,920
industry are you in what departments do

434
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,160
you have what your what level of

435
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,279
vet and is is required within your

436
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,800
organization

437
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,320
what is it what are your clients

438
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,680
expectations answering all those

439
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,440
questions and getting that

440
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,199
and the kind of baseline of your

441
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,560
organization to understand you know what

442
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,479
really are the threats

443
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,839
within this is also going to be you know

444
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,560
what are the current incidents that have

445
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,440
occurred

446
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,800
doing that kind of enriching your or

447
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,959
providing the context

448
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,800
and to understand the current current um

449
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:08,319
threat intelligence for

450
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,839
for your industry and your geographical

451
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,399
location

452
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,800
the next step is threat integration so

453
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:17,600
that's where are our risks

454
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,160
and and that's taking into account the

455
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,079
threats

456
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,519
and and the the kind of baseline that

457
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,560
we've created in the um

458
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:26,959
in the preparation phase and overlaying

459
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:28,319
all of the controls all of the programs

460
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,359
and and

461
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,440
educational um aspects of your um your

462
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,279
role as well as any of the um kind of

463
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,800
monitoring and detection and

464
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,639
capabilities that you have

465
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,079
this is where you overlay so that's what

466
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:42,639
this is where you're air going to find

467
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,599
out um you know potentially where your

468
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,440
gaps are

469
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,639
certainly where your um kind of risks

470
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,040
are and from this

471
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,759
um i suppose good examples of this are

472
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,439
you know

473
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:56,560
um yes um our threats are

474
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,920
a department r d for example um

475
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,758
but what were the r d scores on our last

476
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,360
phishing simulation or what were the

477
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,839
what were the what was the department

478
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:07,199
scores on uh or how are they fully

479
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,759
compliant with their security awareness

480
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,079
training

481
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,440
have they received um the right levels

482
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,399
of vetting are they receiving the

483
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:16,079
follow-up um

484
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:19,199
you know um travel debriefs and the like

485
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,160
identifying those risks um and actually

486
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,560
calling out

487
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,040
specific areas as opposed to just

488
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,638
identifying risky assets based on

489
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,360
um their sensitivity or their their

490
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:33,120
criticality it's actually a kind of

491
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:36,160
um a more targeted approach to um

492
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,240
not just standard risks but also

493
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,160
kind of dynamic risks and this can be

494
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,480
done on a kind of regular basis

495
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,759
um based on those kind of um those

496
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,959
programs and those

497
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,920
those information feeds and then finally

498
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,239
what we have

499
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,759
is the threat evaluation so you have

500
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,320
most likely causes of action

501
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,920
and most dangerous course of action and

502
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,480
these are ultimately same as you know

503
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,240
same as

504
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,000
same as the same same as any kind of

505
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,920
monitoring and detection

506
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,640
and programs or technologies that you

507
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:07,199
have you identify your use cases

508
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,400
and the most likely are you know going

509
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:10,720
to be most common

510
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,319
and and the most dangerous are are going

511
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,000
to be you know what is the worst thing

512
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,159
that could possibly happen to us and

513
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,720
what controls and what kind of

514
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,520
um monitoring uh and detection and

515
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,160
response

516
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,359
and tools do we have to actually uh to

517
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,679
actually support us

518
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,760
um if that was to take place and these

519
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,840
are you know graded in terms of you know

520
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,200
most likely course of action one and

521
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,280
most likely course of action

522
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:35,039
and two and then and and so on and so

523
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,520
forth but i think this is a

524
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,720
really good um opportunity as a business

525
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,840
because it

526
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:42,240
should be done as a kind of

527
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,039
cross-functional um cross-functional

528
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,200
exercise

529
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,240
just to understand and always you know

530
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,600
coming back to

531
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,640
you know what are the threats to our

532
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,120
people and and and specifically from um

533
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,799
from an

534
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,760
in insider perspective i think one thing

535
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,960
um

536
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,280
certainly that's going to assist with

537
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,919
that is

538
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,200
head over to to kind of this url where

539
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,240
um you can conduct

540
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,120
it's around um 30 30 questions and and

541
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,120
it's covering all

542
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,439
kind of aspects of privacy and

543
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,879
compliance monitoring detection

544
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,200
and retention and all the policy as well

545
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,960
so

546
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,120
you know there's a lot of different um

547
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,360
kind of discussion points and

548
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,199
opportunities to to just understand you

549
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:25,039
know where you potentially are

550
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,840
doing well and where you potentially

551
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,120
could could

552
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,439
improve but certainly from a

553
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:34,639
deliverables perspective in this stage

554
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,440
what i definitely want to see is uh a

555
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,760
list of

556
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:39,679
um your most risk or your highest risk

557
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:43,520
departments

558
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:46,640
a specific list of your riskiest users

559
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:49,200
and based on that dynamic um risk uh

560
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,080
kind of profiling as well as um your

561
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,400
kind of top

562
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,399
riskiest or highest risk assets

563
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,879
so next the monitoring phase and and

564
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,000
here we have uh

565
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,080
what what is essentially a kind of um a

566
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,919
pretty intelligence collection plan

567
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,799
um an icp is a list of all of your

568
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,919
approved

569
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:15,280
uh tested and verified um

570
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,679
intelligence sources or log sources or

571
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,480
technologies that can give you a feed of

572
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:20,400
information

573
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,000
or intelligence that you can use to

574
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,559
actually you know conduct an

575
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:27,840
investigation or to provide context

576
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:31,039
or be a an indicator or um

577
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,199
uh indicator or warning of a

578
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,200
of a pendant inside a threat and these

579
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,600
do range from you know being proactive

580
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,440
and to reactive but if we start off in

581
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,719
the kind of left-hand side we've got all

582
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,160
the external threats and

583
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,559
you know you see you see a couple of a

584
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,840
couple of these and what this is

585
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,960
you know you're not going to necessarily

586
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,360
always um be notified from an external

587
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,559
um source that you know you you could

588
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,760
potentially be under

589
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:57,840
um under uh at risk of an insider threat

590
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,720
but what it can do is like i say provide

591
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,320
that trigger real key one key one for me

592
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,480
you know social media and i'm not saying

593
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,360
you monitor all your all your kind of

594
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,320
users but it can be a real a really good

595
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,158
indicator if

596
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,678
um you know someone's linkedin or

597
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:14,080
someone creates a linkedin account

598
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,760
and adds a load of recruiters or starts

599
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,360
conversing with them with with

600
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,799
competitors and what have you

601
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,120
you know you can get that kind of

602
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:23,840
behavioral intelligence just to

603
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,918
just to identify anything potentially um

604
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,760
potentially in the future

605
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,159
moving over to internal and and i think

606
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:33,360
this is where you know standard mdr

607
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,120
or managed detection responses

608
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,280
looks very much at the technical aspect

609
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,080
and uses contextual data

610
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,799
based on you know a.d or users or or

611
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,080
kind of um

612
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:45,360
other kind of behavioral um uh

613
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,399
kind of machine learning and what have

614
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,479
you in in the internal aspect really is

615
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,799
that like human and cross-functional

616
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,000
partnership with your hr department your

617
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,320
it department

618
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,400
your risk teams as well as your senior

619
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,120
leadership and there's some real crucial

620
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,960
uh crucial stages certainly you know

621
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,600
pre-screening as part of the onboarding

622
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:06,320
process

623
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,678
during hr that you know has there been

624
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,439
is this in place and has there been

625
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,640
anything um identified

626
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:15,120
um that could be potentially a red flag

627
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,679
um as screening is ongoing is there any

628
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,760
kind of

629
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:19,520
significant changes to an individual's

630
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,720
personal circumstances

631
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:25,039
uh you know at home or or professionally

632
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,159
that could be again another alert or

633
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,720
trigger to um

634
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,240
to increasing the risk of of that users

635
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,159
and i also think um

636
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,440
the use of a kind of whistleblower and

637
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,039
the education of

638
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:41,120
um or the inclusion of whistleblower

639
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:42,080
uh kind of hotlines and what have you in

640
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,479
an organization

641
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,439
is crucial and to have that anonymous um

642
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,440
kind of tip off

643
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,960
or anonymous intelligence feed and

644
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,000
because it's you know it typically they

645
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:53,200
are linked to

646
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:56,640
um ethics and um legal uh

647
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:58,000
legal kind of um incidents but it can be

648
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,320
used as an effective way of

649
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,520
um reporting insider potential insider

650
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,960
threats as well

651
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,760
now moving on to um technical from a

652
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,480
an insider threat perspective the you

653
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,879
know we do

654
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,679
we a lot of organizations will focus

655
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,280
their um

656
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,880
their protective controls and their

657
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,840
monitoring and detection detective

658
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,200
controls

659
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,879
on external sources and they will be you

660
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,360
know fairly perimeter heavy

661
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,320
with a you know lateral and or lateral

662
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,120
movement being

663
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:29,200
been a kind of inclusion in that at the

664
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,678
kind of network level but at the user

665
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,960
level

666
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,440
and that's obviously what we're what

667
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,240
we're looking at from a um

668
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,919
insider threat perspective is what is

669
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,960
the actual user doing

670
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:44,159
um on on the endpoint on the asset and

671
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:47,440
and what is it um what is the kind of uh

672
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:50,559
how are those um how is that correlated

673
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:53,520
it takes a very mature mdr

674
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:55,918
program um to you know correlate those

675
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,240
use cases for all the various um various

676
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,120
things

677
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:00,240
various um uh activities that a user can

678
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,158
do that could be

679
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,760
um could be linked to inside a threat

680
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,440
activity now i know damien's going to go

681
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,440
into a lot more detail um

682
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,760
in the other half of the slide but yeah

683
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,400
just one one definitely to um to bear in

684
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,919
mind

685
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:17,600
um the use of a kind of uh

686
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:18,240
authoritative or kind of single pane of

687
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,959
glass

688
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,880
technology that can cover that user um

689
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,520
that user activity that is then fed into

690
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,679
your seam

691
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,280
is obviously the the gold standard gold

692
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:29,280
standard solution there from an insider

693
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,320
threat management perspective

694
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,760
i i also um i i know i said i covered at

695
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,480
the start but

696
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:39,360
you know whether it's um privacy

697
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:43,440
regulations whether it's you know the um

698
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:47,120
international uh law of armed conflict

699
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:50,240
the the um morality or the ethics behind

700
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:52,239
intelligence operations or operations

701
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,000
where which involve the monitoring and

702
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,240
and detection of

703
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,320
um kind of users personal you know

704
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:01,440
people's actual activity

705
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,480
they do do tend to do have to be a

706
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,000
targeted

707
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,840
so that's what you know that's what the

708
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,440
uh identifies phase is going to

709
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,199
do for for your organization that's

710
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,960
going to identify those that are the

711
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,080
the most um at risk um or the most risk

712
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,200
to the business

713
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,039
then um as well as um is it justifiable

714
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,080
so is there a legitimate business reason

715
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,320
for you to be

716
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,120
um monitoring those endpoints those

717
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,918
users

718
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,719
um and then finally authorized and this

719
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,960
comes into

720
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,400
is it authorized a at the you know at

721
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,279
the um

722
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:35,039
the senior or the executive level and

723
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,600
finally is it an authorized

724
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,799
um intelligence feed so if it is it if

725
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,320
it if it's on the intelligence

726
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:43,120
collection plan there's then going to be

727
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,960
those controls that are put in place to

728
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:46,559
watch the watches there will be

729
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,159
and there will be those logs and it will

730
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,440
be a protected environment that

731
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,760
you know there will be some very

732
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,320
sensitive data that is is most likely in

733
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,000
your

734
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,600
um insider threat and solution um or

735
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,200
or within those investigations so

736
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,199
there's you know there's got to be um

737
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,320
sufficient controls around around the

738
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,320
protection of those as well

739
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,600
so actually moving on to to the kind of

740
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,679
final um

741
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,719
the final two two sections we have

742
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:15,279
analysis and

743
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:18,320
review principle a key principle of um

744
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:20,400
of uh of

745
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,918
intelligence is centralized control

746
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,960
validation and corroboration so

747
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:26,320
identifying

748
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:29,919
um identifying and having a single

749
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:32,720
single point of um of uh analysis

750
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:34,320
where that is conducted finally source

751
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,960
protection i mentioned it before

752
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,080
you know i actually identifying what the

753
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,320
source is it being

754
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:44,639
anonymous um or being um

755
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:46,799
actually you know protected from

756
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:49,279
unauthorized access and disclosure

757
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,000
and one thing you know it's every it is

758
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:54,000
every kind of

759
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,120
um stock manager or ciso's kind of

760
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,039
nemesis and that's you know the

761
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,918
retention of logs and and how we

762
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,158
actually um

763
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,919
how we actually get those uh get the

764
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,320
logs and are they the right logs and are

765
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,080
they

766
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,678
are they giving us the right visibility

767
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:09,120
into um in

768
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:12,320
to for us to provide the analysis um and

769
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,879
and the support and uh work for

770
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,320
any investigations and ultimately yeah

771
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,960
it does it does need to have

772
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,760
a kind of objective uh objective party

773
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,000
or panel

774
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,760
that is conducting the assessment of um

775
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,880
of what the activity actually is

776
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,879
is it legitimate or not

777
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,600
so in the in the kind of review um the

778
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,960
review aspect

779
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,120
what you're going to get is um

780
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:38,080
ultimately actionable intelligence

781
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,840
and from a an operations perspective or

782
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,080
an investigative perspective

783
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:43,520
not all action actionable intelligence

784
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:46,480
ends in a

785
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:47,279
uh an actual response it can just be to

786
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,159
feed into

787
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:51,600
the bigger picture but what what a kind

788
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,840
of um

789
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,279
insider threat a dedicated solution will

790
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,918
do is provide you with

791
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:59,360
the option to respond through alerting

792
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:02,799
and coaching the user

793
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:05,039
um there and then or through actually um

794
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,080
cover and passive monitoring and to then

795
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,840
build up a use

796
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,120
build up an investigation for um

797
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,959
subsequent um

798
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:15,678
either uh legislative or or um

799
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,919
disciplinary activity it'll also give

800
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,000
you an insight into you know how to um

801
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,039
how you can actually remediate those

802
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,679
those risks

803
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,919
and either compromise or use a

804
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:28,080
user-based

805
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:30,080
it'll also give you this period is where

806
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,760
you'll get to review your threat feeds

807
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,720
review your technologies make sure that

808
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,799
they are still

809
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,559
compliant with that the kind of code of

810
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,120
ethics that i mentioned

811
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,240
earlier and then again as with all

812
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,439
investigations

813
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:46,799
this um the conduct of a post

814
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,640
post investigation or incident review

815
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,000
and continuous improvement plan with

816
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,960
that cycled approach

817
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,720
um you know annual basis keep going and

818
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,399
keep going round and

819
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,320
any significant instance obviously gives

820
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:01,279
you the chance to kind of do a kind of

821
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,279
after action review

822
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:05,520
so that pretty much covers off um of my

823
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,200
my uh my

824
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,799
part in the presentation i'm now gonna

825
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,320
hand over to damian who

826
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:13,200
as i say he's gonna give us a look at

827
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,158
the um the specific use cases as well as

828
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,080
the the kind of

829
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,399
proof point technologies that that are

830
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,120
really going to be a force multiplier

831
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,959
within them

832
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,959
within your environment to to either use

833
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,320
as a standalone or as part of your

834
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,880
current and managed detection and

835
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,279
response

836
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,279
program

837
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,760
thank you so this slide shows some

838
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,520
standard

839
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,120
out of the box rules that we provide

840
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:38,320
customers to select from

841
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:41,039
when they're deploying our solutions so

842
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,399
some of the biggest increase on the

843
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,679
right and green

844
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:48,479
were in ones you'd expect uh for example

845
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,000
accessing uh accessing upload and

846
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,600
sharing cloud services

847
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,600
so these are likely by users trying to

848
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,080
collaborate by working around slow file

849
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,719
shares and overwhelming vpns

850
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,480
we also have exporting data from

851
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,320
enterprise web applications

852
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,480
something which has a less obvious

853
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,399
incident connections working from home

854
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,080
and could perhaps be users exporting

855
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:09,439
data from corporate systems for the

856
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,879
paris purposes

857
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,360
now that there's no one to see them do

858
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,120
it and many more ways to get that data

859
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,000
out without corporate property server

860
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,719
and criminal controls to go through some

861
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,600
of the others

862
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,080
uh visiting adult sites scanning sites

863
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,879
or

864
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:27,678
hate sites are again another sign of a

865
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,679
new freedom which users have at home

866
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,360
and while users are free to do things at

867
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,520
home that they shouldn't do in

868
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,120
the office it should not be on my time

869
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,200
and definitely not be on a

870
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,799
corporate laptop especially when there's

871
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,399
a higher risk of malware or other

872
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,840
threats on more niche and unregulated

873
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,239
sites

874
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,199
and then again there's uh use of cloud

875
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,039
storage again

876
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,039
this time with with native apps rather

877
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:51,120
than web uploads

878
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,320
so of course these are all there also

879
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,799
these other alerts which

880
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,080
haven't increased disproportionately

881
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:59,200
during the pandemic

882
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:01,199
by the still significant like clearing

883
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,159
browsing history from chrome

884
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,679
um printing large print jobs and copying

885
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,039
fast usb

886
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,720
which is very important to have

887
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,000
visibility of as well particularly if

888
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,320
they're against policy

889
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:15,520
or they should have prevent preventative

890
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,520
controls in place already

891
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,720
so when focusing on the user we tend to

892
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,200
focus on the three most common ways in

893
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,799
which

894
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,240
we can help customers so let's talk

895
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,320
through those

896
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,880
the first case is really how we got

897
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,520
talking about itm solutions which is

898
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:33,600
that is the technical detective control

899
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:35,279
to identify which are the risk users

900
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,039
and what actions are users performing

901
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,120
that are risky

902
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:41,120
then we move to protect against loss

903
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,600
from those who have access to the data

904
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:45,520
now this is a very different approach to

905
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,279
traditional dlp solutions

906
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,200
in that we look at the behavior and risk

907
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:51,120
indicators leading up to the event

908
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,360
in an effort to flag the risks before

909
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,879
the event takes place

910
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,959
and then the third is to accelerate

911
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,000
incident response and i'm sure there's

912
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,120
people in this session

913
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,880
responsible for that response aspect

914
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,479
that understand how complicated this

915
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,799
process can be

916
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,519
traditional processes take a lot of time

917
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,760
they involve

918
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,960
many cross-functional groups and every

919
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:13,919
minute a case is open

920
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,559
the risk is still present our approach

921
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,320
is really

922
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,240
because we can be the authoritative

923
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,399
source of user behavior

924
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:21,519
to have all these answers in one place

925
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,360
at the outset

926
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,640
and so accelerate this process from

927
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,678
weeks and months to

928
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:31,039
ideally minutes or hours so let's take

929
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,720
a look at an example scenario

930
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:34,240
um what we'll do here is we'll we'll

931
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,519
talk to an example of how we protect

932
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,640
against data loss

933
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,880
which is really one of the more

934
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,600
concerning scenarios for working from

935
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,880
home

936
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:45,279
workers in the pandemic so

937
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,720
as an example you might have a user that

938
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,760
accesses your crm

939
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,440
or another system housing critical data

940
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,960
and then they proceed to download

941
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,960
current lists or price lists

942
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:59,519
they rename and otherwise obfuscate the

943
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:01,919
data to try and support dlp

944
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:04,159
and log analysis and then package it up

945
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:07,120
and then obfuscate it further

946
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,159
now rather than attempt to upload via

947
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,559
web browser

948
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:14,080
they then install something like dropbox

949
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:16,080
or another cloud storage application

950
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,439
and they sync it up to the cloud via a

951
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:20,240
secure

952
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,080
tls connection or they might also try

953
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,360
sending it as an encrypted attachment by

954
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:26,240
email

955
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,600
so this is an easy example and you can

956
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,159
see there are some elements of this

957
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,360
chain that

958
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,760
might or might not be picked up

959
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,080
according to the existing security stack

960
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:35,679
the trick is string together all these

961
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,760
actions both to understand the full

962
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:40,640
scope of the activity of that user

963
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,720
and also to understand and demonstrate

964
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,880
whether there was malicious intent

965
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,960
so logs are very tricky in practice to

966
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,279
provide this visibility to track this

967
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:51,039
complete sequence of events you you need

968
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:53,039
to ensure that all the logs related to

969
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:55,200
each of these stages were collected

970
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:57,360
correctly past you can find them and

971
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:58,880
then retained and available at the point

972
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,120
that you actually do the investigation

973
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,880
which could be quite a way down the line

974
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,799
you'd also need to spend the time

975
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,799
retrieving bundling

976
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,918
uh and explaining the content of these

977
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,600
logs to the relevant internal

978
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:12,320
non-technical audiences who need to be

979
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,879
convinced

980
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:16,559
of your analysis to consider approaching

981
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,960
the user and perhaps considering legal

982
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,960
action

983
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,080
so with that what i'd like to do is demo

984
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,799
a typical working from home use case on

985
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,799
the live platform

986
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:35,918
i'll come up with a new browser so

987
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,080
now we're seeing the alerts for bob and

988
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:39,840
we see there's about 10 or 12 different

989
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,639
alerts that he triggered in his last

990
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,760
session which is quite a few and we can

991
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,399
see these in reverse

992
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,360
uh time order so starting from when he

993
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:50,479
logged in

994
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:52,080
in irregular hours at one in the morning

995
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,519
now again this is probably more common

996
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:55,279
you're working from home scenario but

997
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,559
he's all configurable

998
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:00,159
so he logged in remotely um he then

999
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,240
logged into an internal business

1000
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,200
application and exported data from the

1001
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,640
application

1002
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:08,800
which is more concerning after that

1003
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,480
he then sent an email with a file

1004
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:13,280
attachment to an entrusted

1005
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,679
untrusted domain he uploaded a sensitive

1006
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,280
file

1007
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:20,399
to a website and he exfiltrated data

1008
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:21,760
to a cloud storage sync order now as you

1009
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,679
can see i've opened up

1010
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,200
more details on this first alert which

1011
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,800
is exporting the data from the

1012
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:29,598
application

1013
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,320
and you can see here um who was it it

1014
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:32,480
was bob

1015
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,480
so we broke this down very clearly who

1016
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:38,159
was it what did they do

1017
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:41,040
well he um went to the crm application

1018
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,839
on this this url and he downloaded a

1019
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:47,440
file called boardresolution.com

1020
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:49,599
and then once he did that he then

1021
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,359
continued to do these other activities

1022
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,000
so he then went into

1023
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:55,598
um trying to email that out to an

1024
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,359
untrusted domain

1025
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:02,960
and after that he then uploaded that uh

1026
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:04,480
uploaded a sense zip file to a website

1027
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,800
and again we can see the full details of

1028
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,040
this so you can see that um

1029
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,040
he updated the file the file was called

1030
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,560
holiday pictures.jpg which doesn't

1031
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,160
sound particularly sensitive i mean

1032
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,359
that's perfectly reasonable although the

1033
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,399
use of grid amount his

1034
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:22,319
suspect uh guerilla now is a popular

1035
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,720
um anonymous um and secure

1036
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,800
webmail service which appears to have

1037
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,480
not been blocked in this case

1038
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,880
um or maybe he wasn't coming through the

1039
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,240
proxy at all but we see that although

1040
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,680
the original file name was

1041
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:36,479
sorry the phone name we saw was holiday

1042
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:39,000
pictures.jpeg

1043
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:40,560
that the original file name was

1044
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,280
boardresolutions.dock

1045
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,920
and in fact what's happened is this is

1046
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:48,400
the file he downloaded from the crm

1047
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,920
uh as this file and then he's done

1048
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:53,200
something to this

1049
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:55,920
basically renamed it before exporting it

1050
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,040
uh i can look at the file history and

1051
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,440
see the full

1052
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:00,880
history of that file from the moment he

1053
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,599
accessed it

1054
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,800
so you can see here that uh um he

1055
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,200
downloaded it

1056
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,400
from uh the crm application as all the

1057
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,839
resolution.

1058
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,240
and we can see with a full date

1059
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,119
timestamp uh every action he performed

1060
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,200
in that file

1061
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,960
once we were tracking it so he attached

1062
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:20,319
it to an email and sent it to

1063
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,640
a colleague or a friend then he moved it

1064
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:24,000
and renamed it to that holiday picture

1065
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,160
jpeg file

1066
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
and then after he'd renamed it he tried

1067
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,680
to exfiltrate it in different ways so he

1068
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,560
uploaded it to gorilla mail

1069
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,000
and he also loaded the dropbox and then

1070
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:38,000
he deleted the bathrooms

1071
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,920
from his uh his machine so um

1072
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,920
although he it seems he seems to have

1073
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:43,520
tried to obfuscate his actions here by

1074
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,960
renaming it or he could do

1075
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,640
something like zipping it or something

1076
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:48,240
else because

1077
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:50,319
we are tracking this file on his

1078
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:52,399
endpoint we can pick all this

1079
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,119
up and so if he tries to take measures

1080
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,320
to bypass

1081
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,599
cloud dlp or email dlp we can still see

1082
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,160
him performing these actions on the

1083
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,160
endpoints

1084
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:10,000
so as i can see bob is definitely

1085
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,200
doing a few dodgy things and what i'd

1086
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,440
like to do is look at this in more

1087
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,960
detail

1088
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,200
so if i take the original alerts which i

1089
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,760
was looking at um

1090
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,399
we see that he also triggered another

1091
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,800
couple

1092
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:24,400
such as running an anti-forensics tool

1093
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,280
and clearing his browsing history

1094
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:28,240
in chrome so i want to go here i'm going

1095
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,480
to go away from

1096
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,879
looking at bob uh from a top-down

1097
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:35,200
approach and look at him in more detail

1098
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:37,200
we're using these alerts and rules as

1099
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,439
technical detective controls

1100
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,240
to identify which users are risky and

1101
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,200
once they

1102
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:44,799
end up in this dashboard as a risky user

1103
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,480
we can go into this instant response

1104
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,920
process where we can triage everything

1105
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:50,079
they did

1106
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:52,079
so i'm going to go and look at more

1107
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:54,160
detail and i'll do that by

1108
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:56,000
expanding one of these alerts and i'm

1109
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,240
going to view bob session

1110
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,320
um in basically a full timeline above

1111
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:05,839
session

1112
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,839
so we'll open that up

1113
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:10,880
so what we have here is um that session

1114
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,000
we're looking at just now

1115
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,880
but now we have every event every action

1116
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,680
that god performed on this endpoint so

1117
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:19,520
from when he

1118
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,359
first logged in and google drive sync

1119
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,839
was was loaded in the tray

1120
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,960
he opened up windows explorer then he

1121
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,040
used search

1122
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:29,280
probably to run an application so he he

1123
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:32,480
likely ran the windows explorer

1124
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,400
from uh from the search bar uh he opened

1125
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:36,560
up outlook

1126
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,320
then he opened up chrome and that's

1127
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,078
where he went into

1128
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,320
the crm application so you see him

1129
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,720
browsing on the serum application here

1130
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,000
navigating through a few pages before he

1131
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,919
finds the file he wants

1132
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:51,680
the board resolution and then he

1133
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,680
downloads and exports that file

1134
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:55,920
um now this is giving us context he's

1135
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,640
not

1136
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:00,079
uh accessing multiple documents he's not

1137
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,839
browsing around for a long time

1138
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:03,839
it seems he knows exactly what he's

1139
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,880
looking for and he's navigating straight

1140
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,720
to it

1141
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:09,440
after that he opens the document in

1142
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:11,598
words probably to check what's inside it

1143
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,480
and then once it's decided what's inside

1144
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,119
it

1145
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,000
is useful he then goes into outlook

1146
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,760
attaches

1147
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,119
board resolution which we're tracking to

1148
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,440
an email

1149
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:23,520
and uh sends this email out to a

1150
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,640
colleague

1151
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:29,040
after that now this is interesting so he

1152
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,920
sends the email then he opens up google

1153
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,079
chrome

1154
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,280
and google's how to bypass email

1155
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,880
blocking so

1156
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,400
evidently that didn't work for him very

1157
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,119
well um

1158
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,560
so he then does a bit of research on how

1159
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:43,680
he can bypass

1160
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:46,560
his dlp and his spam filters

1161
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,160
uh he decides on an approach because

1162
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,200
then what he does is he opens up windows

1163
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,920
explorer

1164
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,480
he copies the file somewhere else and

1165
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:55,520
then

1166
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,880
he pastes the file and then you see him

1167
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,119
renaming the file here

1168
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:00,800
from boardresolution.doc to holiday

1169
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,920
pictures.jpg

1170
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:06,000
and after that he goes into gorilla mail

1171
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,520
and he then writes an email in gorilla

1172
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,079
mail and uploads the file that is

1173
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,960
renamed

1174
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:12,640
the bypass dlp so you can see him

1175
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,560
performing all these actions

1176
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,480
and we're monitoring this blow-by-blow

1177
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,920
and generating this metadata

1178
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,839
which we can then trigger those rules

1179
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,119
off and retain for evidential

1180
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:25,680
purposes now what we can also do

1181
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,880
optionally is we can trigger screen

1182
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,720
recording so

1183
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,240
if for example bob does something

1184
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:32,720
particularly risky like

1185
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:33,520
uploading a sensitive board document to

1186
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:35,839
gorilla mail

1187
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:37,280
after having renamed it we can generate

1188
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:39,040
an alert here

1189
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,560
and we can actually perform that screen

1190
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,599
capture

1191
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,040
and that will um capture the events on

1192
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:47,359
his screen at that time

1193
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:49,680
which gives us more context as to what

1194
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:53,200
his intentions were around activity

1195
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:55,200
and also give us more context around

1196
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,598
what was on the screen what he did

1197
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,879
before and what he did after the action

1198
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:00,880
so you see here we're now looking at

1199
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,839
bob's screen uh here's him on

1200
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,119
grindermale

1201
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:04,880
and you see he's about to send this

1202
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,079
email which triggered our

1203
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:11,359
uploads alert we can

1204
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:13,440
scroll back in time from the alert bar

1205
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:17,040
that you see there the alert button

1206
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:20,240
to see what he was doing before that

1207
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:23,680
so you see um he

1208
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:26,240
go back a bit further she has been

1209
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:28,160
googling disposable email addresses

1210
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:34,640
he then decides to go back to windows

1211
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:37,240
explorer find the board resolution doc

1212
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:40,240
and now he's renaming it to

1213
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,240
familyphotos.jpg

1214
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,879
so we can see that his actions are

1215
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,440
basically deliberate he's not doing this

1216
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,480
um because um dlp is mainly an

1217
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,319
inconvenience

1218
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,680
he seems to be deliberately obfuscating

1219
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:56,240
his tracks

1220
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:57,919
uh to exfiltrate the sensitive data from

1221
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,160
the organization

1222
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,359
we do this multiple ways and as we saw

1223
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,118
at the end he actually did run

1224
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:04,799
anti-forensics tools at the end

1225
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:06,800
which would further imply that this is a

1226
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,359
militia event rather than

1227
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:12,079
instant use of cloud storage or innocent

1228
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:12,078
use of webmail

1229
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:17,359
okay so we've established that bob seems

1230
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,319
bad he's a he's a bad bob

1231
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:21,279
so what we need to do now is build a

1232
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:24,079
package of

1233
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,160
evidence to present to his manager um

1234
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:29,440
and potentially to law enforcement

1235
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,720
um detailing all his actions so what we

1236
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:32,400
would do here

1237
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,560
is uh we'll switch away from the screen

1238
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:37,119
recording and go back to

1239
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:38,078
the main console i'm going to take the

1240
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:40,160
alerts

1241
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:41,920
which bob triggered and i'm going to add

1242
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,720
some of these and build a report around

1243
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:46,079
these

1244
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:47,839
so in terms of what we knew to establish

1245
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,880
the context of bob's actions

1246
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:51,200
we're going to take the fact they

1247
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,520
exported data out of the uh

1248
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:56,240
of the crm in the first place but he

1249
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:59,599
tried to upload this to gorilla mail

1250
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:01,839
and then he then also sync this to

1251
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,040
cloud storage applications so i'll take

1252
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:06,480
those five

1253
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,839
i can run a pdf and they'll give me a

1254
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,000
nicely packaged pdf

1255
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:12,000
which i can then take his manager and to

1256
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:14,880
other non-technical

1257
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,240
non-technical audiences um in a way

1258
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,920
that's easy to understand

1259
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,279
and that's important because i could be

1260
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,160
doing um

1261
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:22,800
many of these investigations a week and

1262
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,359
i don't want to

1263
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,720
have to spend time packaging up and then

1264
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:29,759
trying to explain

1265
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:32,480
what particular technical data is so

1266
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,440
with the reports that we have here um

1267
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,319
you can see that we have

1268
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:37,040
a quite accessibly pleasing report where

1269
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,279
we have

1270
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,640
the details of each of the alerts which

1271
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:42,640
bob triggered

1272
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:44,160
which led to him being uh featured on

1273
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,480
the uh useless

1274
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,279
dashboard and then for each of these

1275
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:49,599
alerts

1276
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,560
we can see with his full proof profile

1277
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,960
details

1278
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:53,599
and we actually took that took place the

1279
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:56,400
severity

1280
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:58,240
is critical we have a screen capture of

1281
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,640
activity taking place at the time

1282
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,479
which is both easier to understand and

1283
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,920
pretty irrepeatable

1284
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,839
and then of course all the details from

1285
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,079
the metadata about the file that he

1286
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:09,920
uploaded being holiday pictures.jpg

1287
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:12,160
that he sent this to gorillamail and

1288
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:13,839
that it was originally from the crm

1289
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,279
and it was originally a board resolution

1290
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:17,759
document

1291
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,640
and we have each of those alerts in full

1292
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,960
detail

1293
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,000
in the pdf and the user if they have

1294
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,640
access could even

1295
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,240
play back the video um of the action at

1296
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:28,400
the time

1297
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:30,078
so this is really useful because it

1298
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:32,640
basically serves

1299
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,359
um stakeholders with all the contacts

1300
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:38,480
they need

1301
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:38,480
to be able to take action on it

1302
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:45,359
so in summary um as we've discussed

1303
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,119
though this

1304
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,720
the pandemic formula does really create

1305
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:49,599
those perfect conditions inside the

1306
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,160
thread

1307
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,720
for these reasons um people are working

1308
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,279
from home

1309
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:56,720
so many of the traditional controls you

1310
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,480
have about working in office

1311
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,919
such as badging people in being able to

1312
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:03,040
identify people

1313
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,839
colleagues seeing uh their colleagues

1314
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:07,040
in the office um people working in the

1315
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,799
office where there's

1316
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:10,560
um the chance of someone seeing their

1317
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,040
screen or or seeing what they're working

1318
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:13,520
on

1319
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,279
all this is to some extent going away

1320
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:17,920
people can work much more freely

1321
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,440
in their home environment assuming it is

1322
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:20,000
the person that that's supposed to be

1323
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,040
there

1324
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,040
it's not someone that's using their

1325
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:26,319
laptop um

1326
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:28,079
people can uh you know they can they can

1327
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:30,319
view things they can work on documents

1328
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:32,160
without uh transferring on taking them

1329
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:34,240
from

1330
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,359
and this does introduce new risks as

1331
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,000
well as of course

1332
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,640
um the challenges that have been around

1333
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,079
using

1334
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:45,200
uh shared services over vpns

1335
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:46,319
um and the fact that many people have

1336
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,399
been using

1337
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:49,759
other shadow i.t services such as cloud

1338
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,319
storage etc

1339
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,800
um to circumvent issues that they're

1340
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,599
having

1341
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,040
asking accessing corporate resources

1342
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:58,960
there's also that risk of departing

1343
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:00,720
users

1344
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,720
where in all those in organizations

1345
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:04,799
where there are more people departing

1346
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,759
and this does present significant risk

1347
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,280
organizations

1348
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,880
particularly people feeling under much

1349
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:11,920
more pressure to

1350
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:13,440
um present the best the best uh

1351
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:15,680
forward when they're joining a new

1352
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:18,480
organization and they might be tempted

1353
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:21,680
to take data whether it be customer data

1354
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:25,040
or ip developed by the company

1355
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:28,078
that risk is there and requires

1356
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:30,160
controlling and you know in order

1357
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,240
to address these risks um many

1358
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:34,000
organizations do have the inside effect

1359
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:36,399
management program it might be

1360
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,760
formalized especially in the case of

1361
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,359
large organizations

1362
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:40,960
or might be fairly informal and

1363
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:43,920
something which is addressed um

1364
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:44,880
by a security manager but the need to

1365
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,800
actually

1366
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,520
structure the inside of thread

1367
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:53,440
management um in whichever way you do it

1368
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:54,000
um and assess your risk assess which

1369
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,599
controls

1370
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,760
are going to address those and go

1371
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,400
through that process is important

1372
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:01,040
then also having those controls to take

1373
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,240
risk

1374
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:05,839
to mitigate it and to perform instant

1375
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:07,200
response where it's required including

1376
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,799
engaging stakeholders

1377
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,879
having all those tools and controls

1378
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:12,079
available is important

1379
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,319
in order to be able to go through that

1380
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,000
process seamlessly when that unfortunate

1381
00:47:14,319 --> 00:47:17,440
event does turn up

1382
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,400
and with that we'd like to go to any

1383
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,160
questions okay thank you very much guys

1384
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,040

00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,879
time there so

1386
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,319
nick will be at the missing link and

1387
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,160
proof point booth so if you guys have

1388
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:29,599
