1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,119
so next up we've got james and scott

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,279
from advante so this is the last

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,800
presentation that we've got for today

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,960
so just a bit of background on both of

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,360
them james has been working on computers

6
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,320
next

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,838
end user computing nexus for 15 years

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,800
focusing mainly on securing the user

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,880
workspace

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,640
and shane's been around since computers

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,080
were the size of washing machines

12
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,960
uh he's been part of three startups

13
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,720
since 1995 25 year

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,320
plus career in different areas of cyber

15
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,640
security so very well credentialed as

16
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,240
well

17
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:32,000
so the topic that they have is

18
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,519
protecting against powershell attacks

19
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,559
and malicious insiders so i think we're

20
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,160
going to cut

21
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:41,440
straight to them thanks welcome

22
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,919
people to the avanti presentation today

23
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,120
at good old oscertz today we're going to

24
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,239
be speaking about implementing

25
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,839
essential acsc controls and protecting

26
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,440
against powershell attacks and malicious

27
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,960
insiders

28
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,120
my name's shane westcott technical

with the subject win with evante

48
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,520
security

49
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,960
yeah so today we're going to look at

50
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,920
three common threats

51
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,039
that we speak to customers about a lot

52
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,399
we're going to have a look

53
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,159
at blocking controlling managing macros

54
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,280
and the control over powershell

55
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,720
because they often come hand in hand

56
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,880
and also looking at malicious insiders

57
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,200
within your organization how we can help

58
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,640
to manage some of those threats

59
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,719
now finally give a little bit of summary

60
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,560
about what we've talked about and

61
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,559
some of the next steps that you can take

62
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,800
right all sounds good all sounds good

63
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,079
i'll let you go through the three common

64
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,520
threats that we have

65
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,239
yeah so the three thefts we're going to

66
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,000
focus on today is

67
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,280
ransomware seems to be getting a huge

68
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,319
amount of attention

69
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:24,319
uh this year has been 150 increase

70
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,040
in ransomware attacks in the first half

71
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,920
of this year i came out as part of the

72
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,599
oaic data breach notification report

73
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,518
that came out in july

74
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,119
there's been a number of very high

75
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,959
profile attacks

76
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,239
um on organizations that have been hit

77
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,840
multiple times

78
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,560
this year we won't mention any names i

79
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,280
think we probably all know who they are

80
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,360
um but data exfiltration has been the

81
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,920
number one extortion i'd say

82
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,440
of 2020. i saw another ransomware issue

83
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,000
this week where

84
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,560
um just a little bit of data was

85
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,239
released

86
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,760
on the dark web to say look we do have

87
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,920
it we are willing to release it

88
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,920
time to cough up um but also powershell

89
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,958
misuse powershell sometimes comes in

90
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,920
those ransomware

91
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,159
fileless type attacks but also how you

92
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,280
manage powershell within

93
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,679
your organization and manage the misuse

94
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,879
of it

95
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,599
the malicious use of it accidental use

96
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,480
of it

97
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,480
and then finally threats do not always

98
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,319
come from outside your organization

99
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,840
and i've had lots of interesting

100
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,280
conversations with customers over the

101
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,680
years talking about

102
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,959
the malicious insider and how you manage

103
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,640
it and

104
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,040
in lots of ways it's very difficult but

105
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,958
in some very basic ways

106
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,480
you can do uh the best you can to

107
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,159
protect yourself

108
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,000
it's interesting on that one that when i

109
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,760
did a bit of research before i did some

110
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,879
presentations recently

111
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,399
uh the number one step to

112
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,480
control malicious insiders we're going

113
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,560
to talk about that and show some

114
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,399
uh technology around that and also this

115
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,760
one to add in with powershell misuse

116
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,599
is that the way our

117
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,040
industry is working at the moment in it

118
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,399
you know you can't really get away with

119
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,920
totally blocking powershell you've got

120
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,920
to use it for something it's done for so

121
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,280
many things these days the automation

122
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,920
and all sorts of stuff that you've got

123
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,799
to

124
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,319
work out a way of successfully managing

125
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,519
it to make sure it gets used for what it

126
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,040
should be useful

127
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,600
but they're uh you're minimizing the

128
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,440
threats as well so safety

129
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,440
absolutely safety in it on there yeah

130
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,520
so i just want to go through this just

131
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,520
to put a bit of context around

132
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,520
where we are and why we're talking about

133
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,520
these particular things if you'll be

134
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,520
familiar i would imagine with the asd

135
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,320
slash acsc

136
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,159
uh security measures that they recommend

137
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,919
we have a back to basics type approach

138
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,120
we look after the boring stuff the

139
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,520
pouring basics

140
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,600
things like app control patching you

141
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,440
know restricting admin privileges those

142
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,520
sorts of things we do all of those

143
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,880
we don't sort of look after backup and

144
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,560
multi-factor

145
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,159
the interesting thing is that the ones

146
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,320
that we deal with mainly

147
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,000
are the tricky ones so app control a lot

148
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,840
of people find that control app

149
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,840
whitelisting very difficult

150
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,280
to implement we have simple ways of

151
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,198
doing that things

152
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,280
like restricting admin privileges can be

153
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,479
quite tricky our technology makes that

154
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,960
simple

155
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,120
patching itself of apps and os pretty

156
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,359
simple stuff at the end of the day but

157
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,400
getting it automated so it takes less

158
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,800
load

159
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,520
unless manpower is something that we

160
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,199
walk with

161
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,799
quite often and then where we're talking

162
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,160
here today is really about configuring

163
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,240
macro settings because that's a

164
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,400
particular area where

165
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,600
you know blanket security people say oh

166
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,599
just block it

167
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,960
but you know it's virtually impossible

168
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,800
to just block it with

169
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,960
most organizations these days because

170
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,160
they will have an area there where

171
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,080
somebody's going to need to run those

172
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,520
sort of macro things user app hardening

173
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,599
also another thing that

174
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,198
needs to be done sometimes can be tricky

175
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,639
but again you've got to look at how you

176
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,759
can do that what sort of flexibility

177
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,039
you've got

178
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,880
that's all about context right we're

179
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,240
going to talk today a little bit about

180
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,360
context you hear the

181
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,360
context a few times

182
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:01,039
indeed you will okay so let's jump in

183
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,840
and have a little look at

184
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,759
uh macros and powershell and a link and

185
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,840
how we can help you

186
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,919
manage both of these so what i first

187
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:12,638
wanted to start with was a typical

188
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,560
attack chain something we hear a lot

189
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,199
about

190
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,120
so you can obviously have phishing

191
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,960
campaigns and

192
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,319
training users and they that's that's

193
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,520
all very very important

194
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,000
basic controls but then we start to look

195
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,479
at

196
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,120
how do we potentially control those

197
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,919
macros

198
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,840
what they do what they launch and what

199
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,960
powershell scripts can be running by

200
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,359
whom

201
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,638
when we look at that implementing things

202
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,520
like application control

203
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,120
to control the executable content in the

204
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,159
scripts that are running

205
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,720
configuring your macro settings so any

206
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,840
specified macros or signed macros

207
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,560
whatever it might be you're allowed to

208
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,560
run

209
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,599
and ensuring you're patching the

210
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,479
platform

211
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,960
and again all three of these items come

212
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,159
from

213
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:02,000
those acsc essential 8 controls nothing

214
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,479
smart nothing clever

215
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,039
basic security when we look at well how

216
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,960
do we

217
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:12,880
stop or control uh execution of

218
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,880
payloads or existing production code

219
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,159
application control there's the

220
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,280
microsoft maturity level

221
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,479
three recommended blocks again

222
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,520
users should never be running those

223
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,680
tools admins might need to run them for

224
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,280
specified uses but generally shouldn't

225
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,680
be running

226
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,119
when we're looking at that execution and

227
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,520
privilege escalation

228
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,120
privilege management controlling what

229
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,680
applications are running

230
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,840
and patching code vulnerabilities all

231
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,840
out of the acsc essential eight

232
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,679
and you guessed it blocking the

233
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,520
ransomware of the final payload

234
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,879
if we're only allowing approved it

235
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,878
software

236
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,160
then we're going to control against that

237
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:53,039
final delivery so

238
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,560
no edi here no threat hunting no

239
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:58,080
artificial intelligence just

240
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,160
basic cyber hygiene just a boring basics

241
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,960
mate but it's getting that foundational

242
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,120
steps

243
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,318
in place it's always you know you hear

244
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,599
about people you know

245
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,120
real to building a house you've got to

246
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,960
have good foundations doesn't matter how

247
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,080
pretty this second floor windows are if

248
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,198
you don't have good foundations the

249
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,120
thing will fall down

250
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,639
same with security it's multi-layer

251
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,240
everyone knows security is about layers

252
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:18,319
so you've got to get that boring basic

253
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:20,400
layer sorted out at the bottom and then

254
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,879
that will cover

255
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,638
most of your issues especially around

256
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,840
this subject we're talking now

257
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,319
an interesting conversation with a

258
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,039
customer last week who said

259
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,120
one of the real values he got from

260
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:36,240
application control

261
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,519
was the reduction in noise on his edr

262
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,640
platform

263
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,560
yes he can now see

264
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,240
uh a lot less information a lot less

265
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,040
volume to look at exactly what's going

266
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,040
on

267
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,160
uh away from application control and

268
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,120
basic

269
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,959
uh blocking of non uh corporate or it

270
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,080
approved applications

271
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,920
yeah because you're going to need those

272
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,519
platforms anyway anyone you know is a

273
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,360
layered security defense and a large

274
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,720
organization is going to be using ndr

275
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,800
what we're saying here is use the right

276
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,720
tool for the job and the right tool for

277
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,680
this job is those boring basics that

278
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,760
come out and

279
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,359
we have you know one of the best ways of

280
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,160
replicating those out and giving you

281
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,320
lots of

282
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,199
contextuality and flexibility in how you

283
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,160
allow things

284
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,160
and how you block things

285
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,320
okay so shifting a little bit across to

286
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,880
one of the topics of today's

287
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,480
conversation around powershell

288
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:29,680
so the acsc have a

289
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,000
enterprise guide for securing powershell

290
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,000
and a maturity model that goes along

291
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,839
with it and powershell

292
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
in itself is it's not an insecure tool

293
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,120
it's just very widely used and very

294
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,560
powerful

295
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:47,200
and when a threat actor

296
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,959
knows that an organization is almost

297
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,160
definitely using a tool or an

298
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,199
application

299
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,959
then they know there's going to be

300
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,160
vulnerabilities or there's going to be

301
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,479
misconfiguration

302
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,000
and it's a great thing to attack that's

303
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
kind of you know shame we talk a lot

304
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,800
about

305
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,760
patching uh third-party applications

306
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,279
they know

307
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,319
there's probably the top five that are

308
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,680
going to be in your organization and

309
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,760
probably unpatched

310
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,040
yep and that and that's very common we

311
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,319
talk to people about patching all the

312
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,920
time we always

313
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,440
come across people who say yeah we think

314
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,680
we're doing a pretty good job and

315
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,519
they are on the windows side but a lot

316
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,719
of those vulnerabilities that do get it

317
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,480
attack vectors

318
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,240
through them are all about the third

319
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,839
party products because people

320
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,360
they take a lot more work and people are

321
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,399
less likely to do them at the end of the

322
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,120
day

323
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,440
yes if you're if you're heavily using

324
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:34,079
powershell within your environment

325
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,279
i'm sure many of you are you've got to

326
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,319
look at how

327
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:38,720
you can secure and manage this in the

328
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,040
most

329
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,240
efficient way to not restrict your admin

330
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,680
users and

331
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,279
throttle innovation within the business

332
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,160
but do it in a safe way

333
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,880
so these are the three levels the acsc

334
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,399
uh

335
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,560
document within this enterprise guide so

336
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,839
level zero is just a default use of

337
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,599
powershell

338
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,279
now the level they recommend is level

339
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,920
one which is not typical for the

340
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,519
acsc they typically recommend all

341
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,120
organizations should be level three

342
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,440
but the documentation says level one

343
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,800
here and that just shows

344
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,200
that you should be whitelisting what's

345
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,519
running and you should be looking at

346
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,360
verifying scripts by the publisher

347
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,519
auditing everything that you're doing

348
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,440
and making sure you're using the latest

349
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,600
version of powershell

350
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,000
for a level two you should be locking

351
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:24,000
powershell down to specific users so

352
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,160
your specific users can do it

353
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
and making sure that you're hardening

354
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,360
some of the winram and other features

355
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
within powershell and finally for level

356
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,079
three

357
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,120
you should be constraining the use of

358
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,319
powershell

359
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:40,240
and looking at how privileges are used

360
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,519
with powershell and who's using

361
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,399
powershell

362
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,920
and locking it down that way also so

363
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,560
what i want to touch on now is just drop

364
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,760
a little bit

365
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,160
into how advanti can help you to

366
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,800
adhere to elements of these maturity

367
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,760
levels

368
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,000
we're definitely not going to do

369
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,680
everything within this but give you some

370
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,160
of the controls that can help you

371
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,479
further mature and get to where you want

372
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,480
to be

373
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,000
so level one uh it's all about blocking

374
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,880
and ensuring

375
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,519
that only approved powershell scripts

376
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,399
are running

377
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:16,000
so with our product out of the box

378
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,639
powershell is blocked

379
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,360
and what that means is any powershell

380
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,880
scripts that

381
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,040
are introduced in the environment by the

382
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,200
user that could be

383
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,599
accidental it could be malicious or it

384
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,720
could be targeted

385
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,160
be that via a usb key download them

386
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,399
writing the script

387
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,279
coming from a drive by download whatever

388
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,560
it might be

389
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,480
that's all going to be blocked by

390
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:43,518
default so that very very strong

391
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,519
position up front

392
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,800
when we start to look at that level two

393
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,079
we can start looking at how we whiteness

394
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,279
the scripts

395
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:55,439
uh based on specific publishers so

396
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,880
if you are signing your powershell

397
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,079
scripts which you can

398
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,920
definitely do and a lot of enterprise

399
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,800
organizations are doing these days

400
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,920
so we can start to help you to only

401
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,399
approve

402
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,599
signed powershell scripts to run and you

403
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:08,800
can see on the screen there a couple of

404
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:12,160
different ways

405
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,439
that we can start to allow these scripts

406
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,880
to run so you can see in the bottom

407
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:19,200
center of the screen

408
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:22,480
we're approving a script by a file rule

409
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:25,279
and we're adding in there a vendor check

410
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,800
on the file in a metadata to look for my

411
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,760
company llc or whatever your company

412
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,839
name is

413
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,240
and you can see a checkbox there for

414
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,560
verify certificate a runtime

415
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,480
so we're checking the metadata from the

416
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,518
file against the certificate that it's

417
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:40,720
signed with

418
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:41,519
to make sure that file is what we think

419
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,880
it is

420
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:45,040
and again we can control these

421
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,720
powershell scripts by file rules

422
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,959
have you got a folder full of powershell

423
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:52,079
scripts are they all signed

424
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,239
do you want to hash the scripts

425
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,519
to make sure it's the the specified

426
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,160
script running from wherever it's

427
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,360
running

428
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,519
within your environment and again

429
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,880
whitelisting anything is about

430
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,480
balancing you know the the manageability

431
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,760
and security of it you can have the most

432
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,240
secure

433
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,600
uh approach or hashed but it's not very

434
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,320
flexible

435
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:13,600
or you can have it far more dynamic yeah

436
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:15,199
i think one of the things we've both

437
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,600
seen over the years we're working with

438
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,199
this

439
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,639
sort of product and these sort of issues

440
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,760
is that you need the

441
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,880
granular contextuality that allows you

442
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,120
to

443
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,160
manage things in such a way that you're

444
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,079
going to secure

445
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,000
the operation to only be done by those

446
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:33,359
people from those locations that need

447
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,639
it and when they need it whereas most of

448
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,800
the time if people don't have that

449
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:39,040
contextuality or that granularity

450
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,479
their options aren't lock it all down or

451
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,079
open it all up and

452
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,000
in some cases they're just not going to

453
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,000
suit and then it falls into too hard

454
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,199
basket and they leave that vulnerability

455
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,040
open

456
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,319
yep definitely and you can see it at the

457
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,800
top of the screen

458
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,079
talking about that you know as i say we

459
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,959
can we can do things lots and lots of

460
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,680
different ways

461
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,959
here's the option to restrict admins so

462
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,079
by default we want we might want to

463
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,680
restrict admins

464
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,319
to say you can't just go around running

465
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,719
powershell but in this scenario in this

466
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,320
context you can we're going to touch on

467
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,399
that on the next side

468
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,519
we start looking at level three and we

469
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,639
start looking at

470
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:17,920
privilege and controlling using that

471
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,440
dynamic policy and the context we can

472
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,680
say for example

473
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,959
if the user is in the sou and that's the

474
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,519
admins oh you

475
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:27,760
and the computer is in this ou that's

476
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,959
the admin computer's ou

477
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:33,279
and the device is windows 10 and the

478
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,279
build is greater than 1909

479
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,360
and the day of the week is a weekday

480
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:39,920
between nine and five

481
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,360
and the user groups admins then they can

482
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,040
go for it

483
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,759
you know and you can use any ants and

484
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,279
oars blends of this scripted rules

485
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:51,680
who what where why when so total control

486
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,959
and it doesn't just need to be if they

487
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,839
fit that

488
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:57,119
jobs on go we can then say well for

489
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,560
everything you run

490
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,600
you can see in the bottom center there

491
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,439
we've got powershell.exe and ps1 files

492
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,800
you need to give me an audited reason

493
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,880
for what you're doing

494
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,399
and that gives people just do i really

495
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,279
want to do this what am i going to write

496
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,600
in that box

497
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,279
and everything they do is then logged

498
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,360
what the machine was who the user was

499
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,279
what the day was what the script was

500
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:20,079
what the hash of the file was and the

501
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:22,320
reason they gave

502
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:23,359
and the thing that also i've seen

503
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,079
customers do is

504
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,639
is this can allow people to have a wider

505
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:30,399
use of

506
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:32,959
powershell but when most people run it

507
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,759
it's actually de-elevated so it runs

508
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,959
powershell

509
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:39,120
in a standard sort of context it's only

510
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,040
elevated to full-blown permissions when

511
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,480
it absolutely needs to by the certain

512
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,959
people that need to do that

513
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,160
and that lets you use a very useful tool

514
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:49,119
which is powershell but

515
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,759
allows you to lessen the likelihood that

516
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,320
if it is

517
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,240
overtaken and that somebody is taking

518
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,079
control of that it's going to have those

519
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,480
those admin privileges that let it go

520
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:01,920
and do basically everything

521
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:04,400
yeah totally totally okay so

522
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,000
with all of that the the bit that

523
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,880
everyone's interested in

524
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,880
let's have a look at some live software

525
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,520
a bit of live software

526
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,120
yeah so we'll jump across now and show

527
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,799
you some of these concepts

528
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:20,000
uh running in one of our labs

529
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,559
okay so let's have a look at

530
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,520
demonstration now so as we saw in the

531
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,160
presentation

532
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,799
i've currently got powershell script

533
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,840
checking

534
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,960
enabled by default and this is set in

535
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,760
our manage tab

536
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,120
under advanced settings so we can see

537
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,400
powershell validation

538
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,280
is enabled so by default what we're

539
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,160
going to see

540
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,879
is all powershell scripts are blocked so

541
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,559
let's have a look

542
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:49,840
at our target device

543
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:51,678
and i've got a powerful script

544
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,280
that i've created for this presentation

545
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,480
and all this does is pop some message

546
00:17:53,280 --> 00:18:00,160
say hey you're running could be malware

547
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,960
so if we try and run this script what we

548
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,240
see

549
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,760
is this script file has been blocked

550
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,440
we're presented with a customizable

551
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:12,160
message and the user is protected

552
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,200
now what that means is out of the box

553
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,320
where a user

554
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:19,520
runs a document as a macro

555
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:23,840
that uses a powershell exploit

556
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:25,840
then what we see is document opens

557
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,600
and the piece of malware or the

558
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,760
powershell that begins the attack

559
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,039
is immediately blocked so that's

560
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,120
fantastic

561
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,400
but there's obviously some powershell

562
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,239
that we do want running so let's have a

563
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,120
look at exceptions and how we

564
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,520
safely allow powershell right to run

565
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,000
under certain contexts

566
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,840
and what we're going to do is under this

567
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,679
security group i've created

568
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,199
for only group users in a specific

569
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,679
active directory group

570
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,559
i'm going to add a rule i'm going to add

571
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:58,799
a signature item

572
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,799
and i'm going to browse to that script

573
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:06,480
and there it is so when i open it

574
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,400
we get the signature hash of the file

575
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,840
so i'm going to add that to my policy

576
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,480
and i'm just going to save and deploy

577
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,760
this

578
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:17,039
to the test endpoint okay

579
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,919
with the policy now live if we try and

580
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,080
run

581
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:22,000
any powershell script such as the ones

582
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,799
associated with this macro

583
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,480
the powershell script is blocked if we

584
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,679
try and run this powershell script that

585
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:32,480
we've whitelisted by

586
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:35,440
hash then the script runs

587
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:37,360
and there's our this could be malware

588
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,080
okay so let's go a step further now

589
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,199
and let's look at how we can tailor this

590
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,120
down to a specific

591
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,960
context so we'll shift back to

592
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,719
configuration

593
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:48,320
okay so we've shown controlling

594
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,039
powershell through an active directory

595
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,000
group rule

596
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:54,000
we've also got what we call custom rules

597
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,440
so a custom rule looks at the context

598
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,559
that something's happening

599
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:01,679
so here i've created an ozer powershell

600
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:04,000
context rule if we look into this

601
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,520
it's checking to see is the device

602
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,240
windows 10

603
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,879
is it a remote desktop connection and is

604
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,880
the time

605
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:14,240
before 12 35 and this could be used to

606
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:16,240
make sure that scripts are only run

607
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,840
within business hours for example

608
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,720
but there's a massive choice of

609
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,840
conditions

610
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,960
that we can use uh to build out these

611
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,320
rules

612
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,400
and you can even use scripted rules as

613
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,559
well something more dynamic

614
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,520
so what we'll do we'll add our

615
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,320
powershell rule

616
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,280
in here so we'll just read this and make

617
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:39,520
sure

618
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,520
we've got the right rule and the right

619
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:46,000
hash so we just run a rescan there

620
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,360
okay and we'll deploy that policy out

621
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,360
and connect back to the endpoint

622
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:53,120
okay so if we come back to the endpoint

623
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,959
now what we're going to see

624
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,479
if we try and run the script it's going

625
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,679
to continue to run because we are on

626
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,919
windows 10

627
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,960
this is a remote desktop connection and

628
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,280
it is before

629
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,039
12 35 as we can see in the time in the

630
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,360
bottom right hand corner

631
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,960
so if i run this we can see our

632
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,280
powershell runs

633
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,799
okay now let's wait till the clock hits

634
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:17,840
12 35

635
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:17,840
and see what happens

636
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,280
okay so it's now 12 36 and my context

637
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,559
has changed

638
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:28,158
so if we try and run this powershell

639
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,158
script now it should be blocked

640
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,559
and there we go the script is now

641
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:35,039
blocked because the context has changed

642
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,120
so let's look at one more example let's

643
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:42,240
see how we can control

644
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:46,000
how macros allow powershell to run

645
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:48,240
so i've got two

646
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,400
documents here with macros in the first

647
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:54,799
one as we've seen a few times now

648
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:56,320
launches a mal ph.ps1 file from the temp

649
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:59,200
directory

650
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:01,439
and the other one tries to launch this

651
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,559
oddsser powershell script

652
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,559
and both get blocked

653
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,559
okay what we're going to do now is build

654
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,960
what we call a process rule

655
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,879
so this affects what is able to be

656
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,000
spawned as a child process

657
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,600
from any parent in this instance

658
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,679
we're going to create an offset

659
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:23,280
powershell rule so i'm going to copy

660
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:25,919
in our script again

661
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,200
there it is what we're going to do is

662
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:30,320
we're going to say

663
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,520
when word

664
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:36,080
is the parent process we can define

665
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,799
an exact file path we can do a file name

666
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,678
we can do

667
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,799
wildcards we can use the metadata of the

668
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,799
file

669
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,480
we can check the certificate runtime to

670
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:47,679
make sure that what

671
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,559
is running is microsoft word in this

672
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,000
instance

673
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,000
we just use the path

674
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:59,120
so when word.xd launches

675
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:01,600
it is allowed to run this hashed

676
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,879
powershell script i'm going to save that

677
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,760
and deploy it to the endpoint

678
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,280
and see what happens okay we're back on

679
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,640
the endpoint

680
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:13,280
first of all we'll run this

681
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:16,000
windward file and we can see the

682
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:19,280
powershell script is blocked

683
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:22,400
if we now run the ozer word document

684
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:24,639
and the macro launches

685
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,000
we can see our powershell is running and

686
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,039
our powershell script's been allowed to

687
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,080
run

688
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:33,280
so again here we're showing how

689
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:36,399
we can allow specific powershell scripts

690
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,720
based on a range of context who the user

691
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,200
is what the device is what the time is

692
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,760
what the configuration of the device is

693
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,000
so it's not

694
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:46,960
on or off we can be very very granular

695
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,880
in controlling powershell

696
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,799
so the last thing i wanted to show on

697
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,240
this one was part of our visibility and

698
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,520
dashboarding platform

699
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,240
and it's really i guess shows off a

700
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:59,120
little bit the the volume of information

701
00:23:56,240 --> 00:24:00,799
that we gather so this is looking at

702
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,080
some of the powershell data within our

703
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,240
environment that we're capturing

704
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,080
so we have some real-time dashboarding

705
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,320
visibility capabilities

706
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,320
that can be used to give you insights

707
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,480
into what's happening your environment

708
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,678
and this powershell dashboard is showing

709
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:16,960
us you know

710
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:19,679
where when who

711
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,480
uh and what powershell has been run we

712
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,640
can see the top

713
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,000
users who've been executing powershell

714
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,760
in the last x days

715
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:29,120
and powershell blocks in the last hour

716
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,279
and everything on here can have

717
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,639
thresholds applied to them so we could

718
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,799
say if we see

719
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,559
you know 20 blocks of powershell on a

720
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:39,440
device within an hour

721
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,799
and go and raise a security incident uh

722
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,480
that someone can go and investigate and

723
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,879
look at why is that happening

724
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,159
is there a malicious insider who's

725
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:49,120
trying to do something

726
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,000
is there an external attack looking at

727
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,760
that machine

728
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,799
trying to execute something what's

729
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,760
happening so again it's all about

730
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,840
visibility

731
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,600
and lots of customers i speak to they

732
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,639
love all this information to suck into

733
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,158
their seam and go

734
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,679
and cross-correlate with other sources

735
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,480
of information

736
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:06,240
and get more value out of yeah and i

737
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:08,000
think it's important to have visibility

738
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,080
on that you know quite often our

739
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,600
products not just our products but all

740
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,240
products will have

741
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:15,279
details of auditing events sucked away

742
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,000
somewhere

743
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,840
but making it into a very visible

744
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,960
dashboard that's easy for people to

745
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,520
change them up a bit

746
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,960
even you know schedule an email of that

747
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,240
once a week to people so they're going

748
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,279
to have a look at the details from the

749
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,960
previous week

750
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,400
that just helps with accountability

751
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,840
management you can make sure that you

752
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,440
keep me on track of those things and

753
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,918
keep you on top of them

754
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,840
thanks for that james uh switch over now

755
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,400
to talk a little bit about

756
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:42,000
malicious insiders mitigating the risks

757
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,679
so interestingly enough

758
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,080
i hadn't researched this hugely with

759
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,320
the exact words that the guys at the

760
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,639
acsc come out with but when i did it was

761
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,039
quite interesting to find

762
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,799
that when you look at malicious insiders

763
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,720
who steal data if that's the risk you're

764
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,320
trying to mitigate their first

765
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,720
number one thing you need to do is

766
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,279
implement control removable storage

767
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:08,559
media and connected devices to mitigate

768
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:13,279
data exfiltration so that's before

769
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:15,520
you go and do all of the essential eight

770
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:17,440
typically controlling devices and

771
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,200
storage media doesn't roll up in the

772
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,720
essential aid if you look at things

773
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,120
like the sands top 20 comes in around

774
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:27,600
about number 13.

775
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:30,239
i think the cis in the u.s has it around

776
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:33,678
about number eight so it's up there with

777
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:36,080
those very important requirements to get

778
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:38,480
a good security platform happening

779
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,080
but down here with the ocsc if we're

780
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,360
talking about malicious insiders they

781
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,360
say it's the number one thing

782
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,600
if you think about that it is probably

783
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,520
the easiest way for malicious insiders

784
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:50,559
to get control of data

785
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,080
so there's a link there to the

786
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,678
document that i'm referring to there you

787
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,799
can go and have a look at that if you

788
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,000
like

789
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,400
this has been one of the things i've

790
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,799
looked at which is quite interesting

791
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,919
from a usb point of view you know people

792
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,918
think that our

793
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,360
data exhortation and data leak

794
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:08,240
prevention is all about usb

795
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,639
well in some ways it is only because

796
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,320
that

797
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:12,640
part of the market has expanded

798
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,399
dramatically but there are other devices

799
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:17,600
that are much more important than just

800
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:19,919
usbs very cool though there's a few uh

801
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,639
very cool little hackers tools that

802
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,760
i like to see this one is just looks

803
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,799
like a cable

804
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,080
so it's usb ninja cable 75 bucks you

805
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,679
loan it to someone

806
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:32,320
they kick it on it's got a wireless

807
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:35,360
remote and

808
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,559
very much the uh the james bond style

809
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,840
there's a little ring there when you

810
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,399
push the button that activates the

811
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,120
wireless

812
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:42,639
and you can use that to inject some code

813
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,000
when it's passed around so it looks like

814
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,120
a charge cable but actually a good

815
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,399
attack service

816
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,158
and then this one i thought was pretty

817
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:51,918
cool jimmy this is the

818
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:55,120
omg cable which has a built-in

819
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:57,679
wi-fi and web server

820
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,239
so basically you download the app you

821
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:03,120
then connect into your cable

822
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:04,720
and you then code on your phone which

823
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:06,239
talks directly to the cable and then

824
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,399
goes and injects things

825
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:10,080
into the endpoint that thinks that

826
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:13,039
they're just there charging up

827
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,439
their little phone it's awesome and it's

828
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,240
it kind of it all relates back to that

829
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,679
um

830
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,600
social engineering aspect of

831
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,880
i think i've heard it referred to as

832
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,559
juice jacking

833
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,760
everyone is so paranoid about their

834
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,600
phone running out battery and their

835
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,360
inability to go on social media

836
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,639
that they will use whatever cable they

837
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,000
find lying around they don't care as

838
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,320
long as it gets them online

839
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,760
gets them jacked in they're going to use

840
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,439
it and

841
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,039
yeah if you're if you're like that for

842
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,399
actor going around looking at people to

843
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,720
target and this is

844
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,600
still a great way to do it and then that

845
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,320
gives

846
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,600
a lot of ability to do a lot of things

847
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:50,320
so at avani we

848
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,600
are lucky to have a product called avani

849
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,080
device control

850
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,439
as part of our portfolio and this is

851
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,840
used by a lot of the

852
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,600
uh as i call them super secret squirrel

853
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,399
organizations around the world to

854
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,158
protect

855
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:05,199
their devices and protect their data

856
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:07,120
from exploration centrally managed

857
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,440
larger site we have in this country is

858
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,639
somewhere around 300 000 devices quite

859
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:13,840
large

860
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,279
it will centralize well and be able to

861
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,918
manage a very large

862
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:19,600
number of users role-based access

863
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:21,520
control for different functions in there

864
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:22,879
it's a quite flexible architecture

865
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,559
pretty good product at the end of the

866
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,279
day and will do

867
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,840
more than just your basic sort of usb

868
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,159
control

869
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,840
i often talk with customers about this

870
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,919
and i'll just say look if you just want

871
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:35,600
to block usbs you're probably talking to

872
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,440
the wrong people because

873
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:39,039
this is the rolls royce of device

874
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,679
control it's not

875
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:43,039
a i want to block usbs or not block usbs

876
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,559
there's a million ways you can do that

877
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,559
and people probably own

878
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:48,399
two or three products already that

879
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,840
include that sort of functionality

880
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,678
this is designed for those people who

881
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,559
have specific use cases around

882
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,919
things like data copy restrictions so

883
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,799
that you can

884
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,480
block certain types of documents being

885
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:03,039
copied onto usbs

886
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,480
enforce encryption those sorts of things

887
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,240
take shadow copies of everything that

888
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,880
goes out the door

889
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:10,720
even and up to it including doing shadow

890
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,159
copies of every device that's printed we

891
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,799
had a customer the other week we were

892
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,760
talking to

893
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:16,320
who has now got all of their agents

894
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,879
working

895
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,559
from home like a lot of organizations

896
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:22,480
one of the things i wanted to track was

897
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:24,480
i wanted to track how we're going to

898
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:29,200
make sure we know what they're printing

899
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:31,440
out on their home printer in their house

900
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,960
in this case yeah and if that's hooked

901
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,960
up to their

902
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,159
the corporate pc that they're using hey

903
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,880
we want to make sure that if they're

904
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,039
printing stuff

905
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,480
out of our applications we want to find

906
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,559
out what they're printing

907
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,159
so we can centralize that and i showed a

908
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,039
bit of a demo of doing that i set it up

909
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,559
myself

910
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,158
in my house and a little printer next to

911
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,440
me so i did a couple of prints and then

912
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,120
i showed them the data

913
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,640
that we can pick up from that the header

914
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,158
and the file who printed it where they

915
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,120
printed name of the file what was it

916
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,279
containing

917
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,479
and even you can take a copy of the

918
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,960
actual print

919
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,480
output to the printer and you can then

920
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,000
store that centrally

921
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,840
and someone could go in and say okay

922
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,559
exactly what is written

923
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:10,320
in this file that they printed out so

924
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:10,879
very very greatly control there but it's

925
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,960
something that

926
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,559
uh is something we've been doing for

927
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,039
quite a long years

928
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,678
and one of our big selling products down

929
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,000
it's uh

930
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:21,440
solves a lot of problems for people i've

931
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,880
got a customer who i was dealing with

932
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:25,039
who

933
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,240
has wanted it due to the granularity of

934
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,080
information it captured

935
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,000
so that they could use it as a post

936
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:31,840
incident tool to identify

937
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,039
how does data get out where did it get

938
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,918
out from what happened they didn't even

939
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,039
want to control

940
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,360
devices they just wanted to have the

941
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,559
visibility yeah into how data was

942
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,879
flowing

943
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:42,158
yeah and auditing wise is very very good

944
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:43,440
at that as well you could just leave it

945
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,279
in audit mode

946
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:47,760
and you'll get very granular things i

947
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:50,080
mean i run that on my laptop

948
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,960
24 7 on my little work laptop and i

949
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,080
remember

950
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,760
the first time i set it up i uh

951
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,678
tried to do some printing about an hour

952
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,440
later i'd set it up did a bit of testing

953
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:00,720
with usbs yeah it's working really good

954
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,799
awesome went to do some printing

955
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,480
couldn't print and

956
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:07,039
it took me a while to work out ah

957
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:09,519
actually i forgot to allow

958
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:11,360
my endpoint to do printing anymore

959
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:13,440
because it can stop

960
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,639
any printer or you could actually

961
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,840
individual printing you could say from

962
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,440
this particular endpoint or this

963
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,879
particular user group you can only print

964
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,559
that printer over there you can't print

965
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,480
to the other ones

966
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,639
and if you look at where we find

967
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:27,600
ourselves with covid and with so many

968
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:29,519
users working from home now

969
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,240
you know people are more isolated people

970
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,760
are working in what could be a strange

971
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,440
environment for many

972
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:38,158
and you know is there that temptation

973
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:40,399
there to just copy some data off

974
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:42,399
you know might need this my next job

975
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,320
might be of interest to have this

976
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:46,000
um things that they probably wouldn't do

977
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,200
if they were still working in the office

978
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,039
but it feels like there's no one

979
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,080
watching you here at home it feels like

980
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:53,360
a very different space yeah you could uh

981
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,720
you could imagine that people could

982
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,600
think they could get away with that and

983
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,600
then uh

984
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,799
becomes a bit of a danger to the

985
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,840
organizations

986
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,158
the ministers comes in all from

987
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,879
different forms right it's not just

988
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,880
people stealing data and deleting things

989
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:10,320
it can be more

990
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,799
more surreptitious than that yes

991
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:14,080
okay one of the other fun bits we love

992
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:16,000
is looking at

993
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:18,080
live software and i've got just a photo

994
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,919
here of my good mate uh

995
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,000
nigel from sloppy horror the skeleton

996
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,799
there he is uh he's in that photo i'm

997
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,559
not sure who the old guy is but anyways

998
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:29,279
that's you there could be a future photo

999
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,279
of you um

1000
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:34,640
maybe it's me anyway let's dive into

1001
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,960
some live software and go and have a

1002
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,159
look

1003
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:40,000
at how device control actually works

1004
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:42,000
now i've got a little picture here which

1005
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,919
i'll show you is of the keys i'm going

1006
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,600
to use for this demonstration just usb

1007
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:48,000
keys the blue one

1008
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,519
is allowed to run pretty much whole as

1009
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,440
bolus doesn't really matter

1010
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:53,840
because of the brand of key it is the

1011
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,200
red one has some special settings on it

1012
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,039
and i'll show you those and then the

1013
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,159
other ones are just two random keys that

1014
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:02,399
i picked up

1015
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:03,840
so let me first show you my blue key

1016
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,239
and we're just getting in there there we

1017
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:07,519
go and what you can see with the blue

1018
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,119
key is it'll come up

1019
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,119
and i can double click just like any

1020
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:15,119
normal usb key and away i go

1021
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:15,119
i can use that particular key

1022
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,520
let's grab my random key that i found

1023
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:24,079
lying around somewhere

1024
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,800
and you can see that comes up as usb key

1025
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,639
but

1026
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,399
it's totally inaccessible i can't do

1027
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:30,480
anything with that key

1028
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,679
because it's not specifically called out

1029
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,679
it's just a random count picked up

1030
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,960
somewhere

1031
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,639
let's have a look at our red key which

1032
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,440
is the one that's got all the smart

1033
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,960
stuff on it

1034
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,429
so eventually a couple of seconds it'll

1035
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,639
come up with

1036
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:46,639
[Music]

1037
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:48,079
password support the password in and

1038
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,359
once i put the password in because this

1039
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,919
encrypted key is now going to be

1040
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,000
unlocked

1041
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:53,040
i can go in and have a look it's

1042
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,480
currently empty

1043
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,879
now i've also got some rules on this key

1044
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,640
if i try and drag and drop a word

1045
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,078
document onto this key you'll see it

1046
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,118
comes up says hey you need admin

1047
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,820
privileges

1048
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:06,079
i could put those in but even though

1049
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:07,680
[Music]

1050
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:10,079
i put those in it's still not going to

1051
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,118
work okay so i've basically said

1052
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,599
you're not allowed to copy word

1053
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:14,240
documents onto this key you can drag and

1054
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,880
drop this

1055
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:18,240
acrobat one here and what that will do

1056
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,920
is that would just work

1057
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,839
now i've got another document here also

1058
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,000
an acrobat document when i drop this one

1059
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:26,880
on i get into the same loop as the

1060
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:29,119
administrative permissions because if i

1061
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,079
show you that file

1062
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,480
it has the word secret in it okay and

1063
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:37,760
i've set up a policy here for dlp

1064
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,440
to say you are not allowed to

1065
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,800
any folder has a word secret in it so a

1066
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,359
lot of our customers

1067
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,800
will do things like this for dlp let me

1068
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,240
show you a little bit of the device

1069
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,359
explorer and show you how that was

1070
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,359
configured

1071
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:51,598
under removable storage devices i've got

1072
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:53,440
some overriding rules up here that say

1073
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,040
everyone's disabled

1074
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,800
that's a low priority rule so it can be

1075
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,079
overridden by high priority rules like

1076
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,040
these ones here

1077
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:02,800
and what i've said is for everyone who's

1078
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,119
using one of these type of keys

1079
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,920
it's got to be encrypted i've got a

1080
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,520
filter set

1081
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,359
so you can only do acrobat and i've got

1082
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,480
a dlp filter for acrobat

1083
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:15,279
if i show you that just quickly up here

1084
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:16,079
you'll see that my dlp filter says

1085
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,240
contains

1086
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,920
secret so if there's the word secret in

1087
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:22,160
an acrobat document

1088
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,520
it's going to get blocked and then this

1089
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,200
one here this special key this is

1090
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:26,640
actually my blue key saying it's got

1091
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,598
free read and writing doesn't have to be

1092
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,960
encrypted

1093
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,880
it's a couple of cool things there i've

1094
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:32,960
also in this example put on our

1095
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:35,599
shadowing option for our printers

1096
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:36,960
if we got our log explorer i can show

1097
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:38,720
you a couple of things

1098
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,800
denied users so you can see this is an

1099
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:43,118
iso i was trying to access i'd forgotten

1100
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,880
to turn on access for dvds

1101
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,880
you can look at things like everything

1102
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,240
today and you've got a stack of things

1103
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,920
there you've got live streaming you've

1104
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,200
got printing that's been done you've got

1105
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,680
all sorts of things

1106
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:55,839
turning on and off if i go to shadow

1107
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:59,040
user per month and do a query on that

1108
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:02,078
you'll see that shows me my file that i

1109
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:04,079
printed earlier today

1110
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,599
or when this when this log file was so

1111
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,920
it tells the computer

1112
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:08,960
the name the name of the file the name

1113
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,240
of the printer

1114
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,839
all sorts of things you can even get a

1115
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,720
copy of that file so you can go and have

1116
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,520
a look

1117
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:17,359
and see exactly what it is that the user

1118
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,480
was trying to print off

1119
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:22,000
so let's move on now and just summarize

1120
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,640
what we've been talking about

1121
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,680
and i'll let uh james take us through a

1122
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,078
couple of these and we'll just talk

1123
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,560
about

1124
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:29,359
sort of next steps and things yes i

1125
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,240
suppose just to

1126
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:33,920
map back to those three key threats that

1127
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,959
we talked about at the start of the

1128
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,280
session

1129
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:39,040
first one was around ransomware and

1130
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,800
powershell and macros

1131
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,960
so again measure yourself against the

1132
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:45,839
latest acsc

1133
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:47,599
essential 8 and powershell maturity

1134
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:50,320
levels and see where are you today

1135
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,720
you know where do you want to be and

1136
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,720
what

1137
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,720
is going to help you move along that

1138
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:57,200
journey some of it might be process

1139
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,919
some of it might be technology what do

1140
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,279
you need to

1141
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:02,800
to move along and look at your

1142
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,400
your malicious inside threat

1143
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,440
threatenable you know

1144
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,440
is has that changed has coverts occurred

1145
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,720
has that changed due to other factors

1146
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:13,040
is that something that you just never

1147
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,160
really analyzed before or analyzed

1148
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,440
potentially

1149
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:20,000
in the realms of data and finally

1150
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,880
we would love you to come to the avanti

1151
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,960
booth

1152
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,480
and have a chat with us about some of

1153
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,359
our experiences

1154
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:29,440
in all of the things that we've talked

1155
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:30,720
about today

1156
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,400
yeah that's one of the things that we

1157
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,640
love doing is listening to customers

1158
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,240
tell us about their challenges and

1159
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,759
we can relate some of the stories from

1160
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,959
the customers that we've been working

1161
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:42,560
with as well

1162
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,320
uh from myself and james between the two

1163
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:48,400
of us we've probably got

1164
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:50,160
25 years or so experience with

1165
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,760
some of these security products between

1166
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,520
us so it's been

1167
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:55,200
a long road of talking to lots and lots

1168
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:57,119
of customers and getting lots and lots

1169
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,480
of ideas around use cases

1170
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:59,920
one of the great things about having

1171
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:02,000
products that have been in the market

1172
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,160
for a long time helping customers

1173
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,599
is you do get a lot of great features

1174
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:07,279
that customers suggest

1175
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,800
that get into the product so when we go

1176
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,240
