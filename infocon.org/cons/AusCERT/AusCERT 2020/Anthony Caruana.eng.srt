7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:19,439
disaster how to manage the media um

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,440
thank you anthony take it away

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,759
thanks for the introduction aaron and

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,039
welcome to everybody who's here i

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,680
i understand that apparently i'm

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:31,840
standing between everybody in their life

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,840
so i will do my very best

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,320
presentations in plenty of time so

15
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,839
i'm just going to hit the share button

16
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,040
and the way this works i'm probably not

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,079
going to be able to see questions as

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,320
they come in

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:46,239
but i'll move to one of the tables later

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,920
on i think if i after this presentation

21
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,599
table 12 looked like it was an easy one

22
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,480
for me to get to so i'm going to go to

23
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,039
table 12

24
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,398
after the presentation and if anyone's

25
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,800
got any questions they can hit me up

26
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,719
there

27
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,320
or you can use my contact details which

28
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,719
will be up on the screen shortly

29
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:06,240
to email me and ask questions that way

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:10,000
so let me go over there

31
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:13,039
share and hit

32
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,640
play on my slides so

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,560
as i said so the aim of this

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,600
presentation is to talk about how to

35
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:22,080
manage the media during a disaster

36
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,600
this comes from 20 years of working in

37
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,840
the corporate world in

38
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,720
a whole bunch of different it roles

39
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,640
being the

40
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,840
the cause of a disaster in one case

41
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,439
being

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,200
involved in the teams mitigating

43
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,679
disasters running disaster recovery

44
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,840
plans business continuity plans

45
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,000
um you name it i've kind of been through

46
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,000
that whole gamut on the corporate side

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,600
and over the last few years i've turned

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,640
my attention to working in the media

49
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,079
more

50
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,759
and there's a whole bunch of things that

51
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,639
i've learned along the way

52
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,280
about how to manage the media when stuff

53
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,680
goes pear-shaped in your business

54
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,680
uh i'm going to apolog sort of it's

55
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,680
always bad form to apologize before you

56
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,200
start but i'm a bit of a clint eastwood

57
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,560
fan and i've decided that today's

58
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,840
presentation is going to be clint

59
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,040
eastwood themed and it's going to be

60
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,800
about the good the bad and the ugly

61
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,399
and i intentionally picked this because

62
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,680
dirty harry leaves everyone dead at the

63
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,959
end and i didn't think that was the

64
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,360
outcome we're all looking for

65
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:17,520
so i'm going to go through very quickly

66
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,040
three case studies today

67
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,640
um i mean each one's going to be pretty

68
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,519
short only take a few minutes but from

69
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,200
each one

70
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,800
there are a couple of takeaway lessons

71
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,879
that are really really important to be

72
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,879
able to understand

73
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,399
so as i said i've done over 20 years

74
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,000
working in corporate i.t

75
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,360
uh quite a long time working as a

76
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,760
freelance journalist and part of that

77
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,360
time

78
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,239
overlapped otherwise i'd be about 90

79
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,120
years old i've written bcp in disaster

80
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:42,080
plans i've

81
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,599
written about disasters for the media uh

82
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,360
i think one of the most poignant ones

83
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,640
that i was involved with was visiting

84
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,519
christchurch after their massive

85
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,200
earthquake

86
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,400
and talking to all sorts of different

87
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,640
businesses and local government

88
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,519
organizations about how they recovered

89
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,958
from that massive um devastating event

90
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:59,360
in that city

91
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,159
and i've been involved in executing data

92
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,159
disaster plans

93
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,760
now i know in the in the security world

94
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:08,239
over the last decade or so we've had

95
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,000
this concept called xero trust

96
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,760
and we've applied it to how we handle

97
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,879
assets on our network and people on our

98
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,518
networks

99
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:17,518
but you kind of have to take that same

100
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,120
sort of approach when you think about

101
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,680
dealing with the media when something

102
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,840
goes pear-shaped in your organization

103
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,680
it is almost impossible to keep a secret

104
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,400
and i say almost because

105
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,920
you do sometimes have the opportunity to

106
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,760
control things

107
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,440
but that comes from really great

108
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,518
planning and preparation

109
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,040
um there was this example just this week

110
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,200
um from cleanaway whose

111
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,480
ceo was accused of bullying and

112
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:43,280
harassment

113
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,760
um and he sent an all staff email um

114
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,680
just

115
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,959
talking to people about you know making

116
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,560
sure that

117
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,000
information doesn't get out and trying

118
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,000
to understand you know explain the

119
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,159
situation to his personnel

120
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,400
and that email went out outside the

121
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,079
organization into the hands of the media

122
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,000
and you end up with an exclusive in the

123
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,519
financial review talking about how

124
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,720
you're trying to cover stuff up um and

125
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,799
it doesn't end up being a great story

126
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,000
i do know of organizations you know

127
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,239
quite recently that have had

128
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,840
really good outcomes in managing

129
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,560
a disaster that's happened in their

130
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,440
organization in it not getting out

131
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,680
um and that's happened because they've

132
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,240
had really good planning in place

133
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,440
really good communication strategies and

134
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,000
they've been able you know they've

135
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,600
understood

136
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,199
that if things get out it can be quite

137
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,639
damaging to the organization

138
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,160
so they're they're doing the right

139
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,120
things in terms of who they have to talk

140
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,400
to but they don't have to

141
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,840
disclose it you don't want the

142
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,198
disclosure to come out in the media

143
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,960
without you being in control of the

144
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,800
message

145
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,080
so with that i'm going to start by

146
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,800
talking about the good

147
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,599
in the good bad and the ugly um and this

148
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,840
is a

149
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,960
a case that most almost everyone's going

150
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,239
to be pretty familiar with it's about

151
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,440
three years old now

152
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,479
but it was what happened at the red

153
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,240
cross red cross blood service

154
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,919
um the short the short of it was that an

155
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,520
it contractor put a whole bunch of data

156
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:03,840
on a cloud storage service

157
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,758
but the security settings weren't right

158
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,880
um a security researcher found them

159
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,000
basically just by

160
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,719
sort of randomly searching for stuff

161
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,759
he notified troy hunt who many of you

162
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,600
know

163
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,199
and the whole thing was validated and it

164
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,000
made the news

165
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,840
clearly became a public incident over

166
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,600
half a million blood donors

167
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,758
information was made public for a short

168
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,840
time the the risk of misuse was

169
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,520
independently assessed as low

170
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,520
but everyone who was potentially

171
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,560
affected was notified i'm a blood donor

172
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,000
and i received

173
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,759
emails text messages there was there was

174
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,840
it was there were obviously all very

175
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,520
large um statements made

176
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,359
through the media through advertising

177
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,639
and so forth

178
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,479
even though it was a third-party

179
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,560
contractor

180
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,000
what was amazing about this is the ceo

181
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:53,120
of the red cross blood service

182
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,680
stood on tv and said this is

183
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,039
a failure on our part i'm the leader of

184
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,960
the organization

185
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,120
i'm taking direct responsibility for

186
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,280
this i've seen other incidents

187
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,199
similar to this where they hang the

188
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,400
contractor out to dry in fact in this

189
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:08,319
case even though the

190
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,599
ceo took responsibility that that other

191
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,160
company

192
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,800
lost huge amounts of business afterwards

193
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,000
and

194
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,840
my understanding is that they actually

195
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,840
folded eventually

196
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,119
but so the impact can be quite

197
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,520
substantial

198
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,560
but the really big message here is when

199
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,159
something went wrong

200
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,000
they actually had a process in place to

201
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,680
deal with this and they had a ceo who

202
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,759
was courageous enough to stand up and

203
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,759
take the direct responsibility

204
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,319
and not try to push the blame out for

205
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,919
someone else so

206
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,560
some of the lessons that come from this

207
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,039
particular case study

208
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:42,720
they dealt in facts if you go back and

209
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,240
look at the media coverage of what went

210
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,960
on during that incident

211
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,160
no the the red cross blood service made

212
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,880
sure that they got all the information

213
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,479
and presented it as a statement of fact

214
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,080
they talked about how

215
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:57,840
this is what happened the contractor put

216
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,359
the data out there they put the

217
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,000
incorrect settings on the data

218
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,160
repository on that cloud service

219
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,120
as a result someone who was looking for

220
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,960
vulnerabilities

221
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,840
found the data they ethically notified

222
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,440
they went through an ethical

223
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,880
notification process of what happened

224
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,960
with that data

225
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,479
then the red cross took responsibility

226
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,799
for the issue

227
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,479
and they had really strong notification

228
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,560
processes in place

229
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,000
now those notification processes are now

230
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,160
something everyone's going to have if

231
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
you're handling any personal information

232
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,000
if you've got pii you need to have those

233
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,160
notification processes in place

234
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,199
because that's what the the data breach

235
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,440
notification

236
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,280
regime that we operate under requires

237
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,880
you to have

238
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,638
um just on that on the data breach

239
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,440
notification regime that we have in

240
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,039
australia

241
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,319
it's interesting to note that in new

242
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,680
zealand then i know there'd be a lot of

243
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,360
people who work

244
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:51,520
operate across the tasman in new zealand

245
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,120
those rules are changing later this year

246
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,000
so that there'll be notification

247
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,319
required for lots of access to data

248
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,479
so even if the data's not breached or

249
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,400
sent out to an unauthorized party

250
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,479
you may actually need to notify people

251
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,159
if the data can't be accessed

252
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,800
so if you're under a denial of service

253
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,240
attack or a ransomware attack and you're

254
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,440
confident that no data has been

255
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,199
stolen or copied out of the organization

256
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,319
but it can't be accessed for a time

257
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,840
you'll still have to do a notification

258
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,520
so they're the three big lessons there

259
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,840
is notification processes take

260
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,599
responsibility and get your facts

261
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:29,840
straight the bad of the good bad and the

262
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,599
ugly

263
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,279
online retail is obviously a place where

264
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,000
a whole bunch of pii

265
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,360
is out is available to those companies

266
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,440
and also it's a

267
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,279
ma it's a place where a breach can have

268
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,039
very very serious consequences for the

269
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:45,039
commercial viability of an organization

270
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,240
in may 2011 customer data breach was

271
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,719
detected by catch of the day

272
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,760
which has now changed its name to catch

273
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,080
and is now

274
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,959
in fact owned by i think the the same

275
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:02,000
group that owns coals

276
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:04,560
so catch the day report said that they

277
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,560
had a breach in may 2011.

278
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,399
it took three years before customers

279
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,239
were notified for just a touch over

280
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:12,640
three years

281
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,560
customers were notified and catch

282
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,360
actually said that the afp was notified

283
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,959
federal police but neither the afp or

284
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,480
the commit the privacy commissioner

285
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,959
say that they were actually notified of

286
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:26,640
the breach at the time

287
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:28,160
now what makes this kind of interesting

288
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,000
is that the breach happened at the same

289
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,519
time as a funding round went through and

290
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,640
catch picked up 80 million bucks of

291
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,279
investment

292
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,080
so it's clear that that it's for an

293
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,839
outsider looking at this

294
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,480
the potential is that what's happened is

295
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,959
that there's been a breach

296
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,240
it's put some funding at risk so it's

297
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,680
been kept quiet

298
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,880
but eventually it came out um the lesson

299
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:53,920
for this is the truth

300
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,720
almost always comes out

301
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,719
almost always

302
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,040
so i really want people to think about

303
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,959
this about how it comes out and how

304
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:05,199
you just gotta understand that you might

305
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,920
do everything in your power to mitigate

306
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,279
the risk of

307
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,519
information leaking out of your

308
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,200
organization

309
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,880
but what's going to be worse you

310
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,320
fronting up to it and saying here's the

311
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,160
problem

312
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,760
or it coming out three years later and

313
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,199
your customers discovering that

314
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,200
something bad something bad has happened

315
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,040
with their information

316
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,519
and you've been hiding it from them

317
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,360
uh i think when it comes to that

318
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,440
notification

319
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,360
of when a breach happens i think you

320
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,399
know the red cross blood banks

321
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,920
shelley park the ceo it's got the gold

322
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,839
standard for how to do this

323
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:42,160
this is what she actually said to the

324
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:45,200
media we are extremely sorry

325
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,199
we are disappointed we apologize we

326
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,040
accept that this is unacceptable

327
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:53,200
they apologized undeserved unreservedly

328
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,319
they took all the responsibility for

329
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,760
that incident

330
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,800
uh in contrast i've never really heard

331
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,200
catch

332
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,719
take that kind of ownership of the

333
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,720
problem and say we did the wrong thing

334
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,240
i have a story about that but i can't

335
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,959
tell you because it was in confidence

336
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,240
off the record

337
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,800
but anyway the third instant i want to

338
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,920
talk about

339
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,319
is the ugly this is um

340
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,319
something that is this is an incident

341
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,240
that resulted in loss of life

342
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:26,880
um it was a huge international incident

343
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,240
and it was terribly handled in fact it's

344
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,000
so badly handled

345
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,680
that it's the stuff of university case

346
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,320
studies and academic papers if you go

347
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,319
and look for it

348
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,640
some years ago in 2010 so this is 10

349
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,320
years ago a

350
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,560
oil rig exploded into in and the result

351
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:47,040
of that was that 11 people died

352
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,560
that 780 million gallons of oil leaked

353
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,880
over two weeks

354
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,680
and further leaks from that disaster

355
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,040
were found over

356
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,959
a number of years afterwards the

357
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,839
environmental impact was huge at the

358
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,839
time and he's ongoing

359
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,599
that disaster obviously it's going to be

360
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,680
pretty hard to hide

361
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,560
something like that so you know it's

362
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,920
going to be out in the public domain

363
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,119
you know people are going to find out

364
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,000
about it and you know that people are

365
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:13,760
going to start asking

366
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,800
store asking for the what happened

367
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,480
this was an incident that bp tried to

368
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,719
blame on someone else

369
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,760
so even though they operated the oil

370
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,800
platform

371
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:27,439
they pointed to contractors

372
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,439
on the on the oil rig they pointed to

373
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,959
this being a leased oil rig so they

374
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,680
don't own it so therefore it's not their

375
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,920
problem

376
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,680
they weren't the cause of the problem at

377
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,319
every turn they tried to obfuscate the

378
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:42,560
blame for this

379
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:46,399
incredibly incredibly

380
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,880
the ceo said these words he said

381
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,639
that it's a pretty tiny incident it's

382
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,959
only a very small amount of oil in a

383
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,519
very big ocean

384
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:57,119
and when someone said to him he was

385
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,120
questioned about the loss of life

386
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,560
after a period of time and the impact of

387
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,000
this

388
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:05,279
his response was you know i'd just like

389
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,440
my life back

390
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:09,040
it was like the loss of life and the

391
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,880
environmental impact just got

392
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,079
you know just it was just a bit too much

393
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,519
and it was just getting in the way of

394
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,560
him living his life

395
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:18,839
it was probably a emotive response

396
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,079
from an executive who was under huge

397
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,279
pressure

398
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:26,239
but it played terribly at the time

399
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,240
absolutely terribly

400
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,360
the reason this is a big deal i think is

401
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:33,680
because

402
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,360
businesses executives need to be trained

403
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,120
in how to speak to the media

404
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,880
i've worked in the energy industry for a

405
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,880
number of years um

406
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,560
and for those who can remember back uh

407
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,920
about probably about ten or

408
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,760
so year i'll quickly move more than that

409
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,120
probably 15 or so years ago

410
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,800
there was a massive power system

411
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,480
incident in victoria where

412
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,719
huge slaves of the state were blacked

413
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,480
out melbourne

414
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,920
homes in melbourne run the power outages

415
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,360
there were we had you know

416
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,719
everyone was under restrictions on

417
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,839
alternate days you weren't allowed it

418
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,199
was the peak of summer we weren't

419
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:04,079
allowed to use air conditioners

420
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,199
all sorts of stuff it was really really

421
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,079
ugly

422
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,639
and at the time our ceo went on the tv

423
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,120
on the

424
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,079
on the 7 30 report and was asked a bunch

425
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,320
of questions about

426
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,680
the org out but our role as a regular

427
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,519
power system operators

428
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,839
role in those outages and what had

429
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,839
happened

430
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,000
and for the most part the questions were

431
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,519
pretty tame to start with

432
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,800
and this is what the media will do when

433
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,760
they're speaking to you they'll ask you

434
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,399
a bunch of questions that you're going

435
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,519
to feel comfortable with and then they

436
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,639
hit him with the question that he

437
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,720
couldn't handle

438
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,000
the question he couldn't handle was

439
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
because the way the power system

440
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,240
operated

441
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,160
operates it now if power is not being

442
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,519
used in victoria the potential exists

443
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,040
for the power being generated in

444
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,959
victoria to go across the border into

445
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,800
new south wales

446
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,399
and he was asked point blank so if

447
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,120
victorians are under power restrictions

448
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,959
why is

449
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:55,760
energy produced in victoria going to

450
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,119
families in new south wales

451
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,319
and the question was actually pretty

452
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:02,399
easy to answer if you've been prepared

453
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,920
the answer that is if you're not using

454
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,360
electricity at the time we didn't have

455
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,000
mass storage available so i had to go

456
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,120
somewhere

457
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,959
otherwise you end up with different

458
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,480
problems inside the power system so it

459
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,000
flowed to where it was used

460
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,000
rather than in victoria where it was not

461
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,440
going to be used he didn't have that

462
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,720
answer because he hadn't been prepared

463
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,760
for the question

464
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,279
and he was completely flustered and

465
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:24,480
ultimately he only lasted about another

466
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,800
year in that role before he moved on

467
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,079
you need to have really well trained

468
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,079
spokespeople

469
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,599
that can handle difficult questions or

470
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,959
challenging questions

471
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,120
that's one of the things that we go

472
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,119
through you know i spoke to a founder of

473
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,320
a large company a little while ago

474
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,000
and asked him what i thought was a

475
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,040
pretty innocuous question about company

476
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,959
culture

477
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,040
and you know it kind of lost it at me

478
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,079
got angry became very defensive

479
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,680
all those sorts of things that was

480
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:49,120
impractical in a practice interview by

481
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,120
the way

482
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,279
it's because he wasn't ready for it and

483
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,360
it threw him through a little bit

484
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,720
it's really important to train

485
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,600
spokespeople

486
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,800
you need a plan if you go back through

487
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,560
the different lessons that i've got

488
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,240
through that i've spoken about so far

489
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,560
today

490
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,399
what we've actually what you really

491
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,040
realize is that the companies that do

492
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,480
best

493
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,240
when something goes wrong in their

494
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,360
businesses are those that have practiced

495
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:18,000
and prepared it means

496
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,199
creating a set of scenarios it's exactly

497
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
the same as what you know you'll find

498
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:22,719
red teams do

499
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,639
for example or pen testers do is they'll

500
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,240
think of scenarios where they can break

501
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,959
into something or make something go

502
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,440
wrong

503
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:31,599
and then put in and tease those out so

504
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,399
then you can use that information to

505
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:36,639
fix or make or add you know more

506
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,519
security controls or to change the way

507
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:39,600
you do things don't

508
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,720
you can shore up your systems the same

509
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,560
goes with when you're dealing with the

510
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,920
media when something goes wrong

511
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,680
what are all the things that potentially

512
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,279
could happen in your business you know a

513
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,719
good example might be

514
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,720
if you worked in health services or

515
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,079
denial of service attack

516
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,600
could be a really big deal because it

517
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:54,638
could stop access to health data for

518
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,480
people

519
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,399
if you're a retailer it's about loss of

520
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,639
p it could be about loss of pii

521
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,560
something like what happened to target i

522
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,039
mean 2013.

523
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,559
it could be any kind of security

524
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,039
incident that results in either loss of

525
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,599
data

526
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,359
loss of access to data or something

527
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,599
that's going to affect the confidence

528
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,799
of your customers and your business

529
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:17,039
partners

530
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,240
in the market so you need to think about

531
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,599
what all those different possible

532
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:23,039
scenarios are

533
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:24,240
and list them from that from that list

534
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,000
you work out

535
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,319
who are the best people to speak about

536
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,559
this my advice is

537
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,000
to people need to put their egos away a

538
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,160
little bit you probably

539
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,840
don't want your most senior managers and

540
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:38,160
your ceo

541
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,918
answering the day-to-day questions here

542
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,880
if something substantial happens in your

543
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,120
business

544
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,880
what you're going to find is that the

545
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,239
media is going to ask you a lot of

546
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,840
questions

547
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,440
you're going to get and it'll be

548
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,678
different sections of the media

549
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,360
asking you similar questions the best

550
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,080
thing you can actually do is have direct

551
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:57,120
all of that to

552
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,799
a single funnel so you have a person who

553
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:03,199
is the gatekeeper

554
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:05,440
for your questions that gatekeeper

555
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,720
is then able to say right we're all

556
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,760
we're getting asked the same question

557
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,400
about

558
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,840
how did the breach happen for example so

559
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,440
you have an established set of facts and

560
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,039
you give everybody the same facts and

561
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,320
you send them out once

562
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,760
you don't go and answer the questions

563
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,360
over and over and over and over again

564
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,799
you put out the information

565
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:25,360
once and you deal with it from that

566
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,360
then you've got the opportunity to

567
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,678
actually assess what's going on

568
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,719
and continue to oh you need to own the

569
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,080
discussion

570
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,000
you're going to get asked a lot of hard

571
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,159
questions be ready for them

572
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,919
think about look at past incidents that

573
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,200
have happened one of the best pieces of

574
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,039
advice i've had with dealing with

575
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:43,360
breaches and with incidents is

576
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,520
look at your near misses um a good

577
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,399
example of that was when we went through

578
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:49,039
the whole big

579
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,480
wannacry thing a couple of years ago the

580
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:52,480
companies that i spoke to

581
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,080
in their ransomware response said we

582
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,799
didn't get hit by wannacry

583
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,080
but we're being really really careful

584
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,120
and looking at what happened to the

585
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,960
people who were

586
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,239
so that we can learn from those

587
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,760
experiences

588
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,280
so go and actually look for companies

589
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,120
that have disasters and look at their

590
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,039
response and learn from it

591
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,719
learn what sorts of questions you prep

592
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,840
you're going to be asked or potentially

593
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:15,280
asked

594
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,840
and then from that you're able to

595
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:19,600
hone your own response and be prepared

596
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,600
you know we talk to people about for

597
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,199
example i'll just stop sharing so i can

598
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,240
see what you guys are seeing you can see

599
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,720
me

600
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,559
when we talk to people about that we

601
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:29,600
talk about the sorts of response they

602
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,918
need to be ready for

603
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,240
and that might be for example having

604
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:35,679
press statements prepared ahead of time

605
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,400
so for example you might have something

606
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,440
that says in the event of a data breach

607
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,679
here's what we're going to tell the

608
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,320
press and have a boiler plate ready to

609
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,480
go

610
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:45,439
when i worked in energy we had boiler

611
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,120
plate messaging

612
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:51,039
ready to go for every kind of power

613
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,918
system incident we could anticipate

614
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:54,559
so whether that was a terrorist attack

615
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,000
or

616
00:19:54,559 --> 00:20:00,240
a a system failure of some sort

617
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,760
or you know any any kind of thing that

618
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,120
would have potentially gone on

619
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,120
we were ready for that and we had a

620
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,439
whole bunch of ready to go statements

621
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,120
and they weren't perfect you'd have to

622
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,480
hone them on the day or at the time of

623
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,039
an incident to send them out

624
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,080
but you get them ready ahead of time now

625
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,679
we talk about

626
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,600
you know if you've been involved in

627
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,559
education or training or anything like

628
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,760
that in the past

629
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,600
you've probably heard about a term

630
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,520
called cognitive load

631
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,959
what we try to do is reduce the

632
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,440
cognitive load when you

633
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,120
do that preparation it means that when

634
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,360
stuff happens you don't have to think

635
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,239
about the anticipatable events

636
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,520
you know that you're going to have to

637
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,080
put some messaging out if there's a

638
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,400
breach be ready for it have it done

639
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,000
have the message ready to go so you only

640
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,880
have to fiddle it a little bit to get it

641
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,960
out and ready

642
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,159
have your contact list ready know who

643
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,280
you're gonna have to contact when

644
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,360
something goes on

645
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,120
just as the privacy rules now and the

646
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,678
data breach notification rules require

647
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,439
that you

648
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,039
have a list of all the people all your

649
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,320
customers so that you can notify them if

650
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,679
their data's been breached

651
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,918
you need to have the same kind of thing

652
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,400
ready for the media have your media

653
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,840
lists

654
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:03,120
ready so that you're ready to

655
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:05,600
communicate

656
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,199
look i'm mindful of time and i actually

657
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,559
have rattled through a little bit faster

658
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,000
than i'd planned

659
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,360
but if anyone's got any questions

660
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,880
perhaps if you want to pop them into the

661
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:17,840
chat or the q a

662
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,840
and i can take a few questions as we go

663
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,120
okay we've got one if a breach occurs

664
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,559
due to a vulnerability that someone in

665
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,000
the organ raised a long time ago but the

666
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,240
org did not prioritize how do you

667
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,960
recommend that's represented the media

668
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,520
look that's a really tough one uh this

669
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,039
is why

670
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,840
it's really important to actually do the

671
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:43,440
right things uh you know we've got the

672
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:46,000
uh the asd's essential eight um

673
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,440
there's heaps and heaps of different

674
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,039
guidance out there on the keeping

675
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,640
systems up to date

676
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:52,400
if you've been breached because

677
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,679
something went because you haven't done

678
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,200
the right thing in terms of your

679
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,200
compliance and making sure you keep

680
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:58,480
things up to date

681
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,000
the trick the thing you're going to have

682
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,720
to do is just be really honest about it

683
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,200
and say

684
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,640
we made a mistake i look at examples

685
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,480
such as for example when

686
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,480
um ebay got breached a number of years

687
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,320
ago and a whole bunch of customer data

688
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,919
was stolen

689
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:16,000
they their customer um numbers

690
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,360
and transaction numbers actually went up

691
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,799
following the breach which i thought was

692
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,760
look at the time within them go that's

693
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,120
pretty amazing

694
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:23,360
they're being breached but more people

695
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:24,320
are going to them the reason they

696
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,080
actually did better

697
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,678
was because they accepted the problem

698
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:29,360
and then they made things a lot better

699
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:33,280
and they talked to people

700
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,799
about being better so

701
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,639
that's i think that's probably the

702
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:38,240
answer to that one is probably you you

703
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,440
cop it on the chin and you say hey we

704
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,679
did the wrong thing

705
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:43,760
but as a result we have now fixed that

706
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,320
problem and we are actually now doing

707
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,799
things

708
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,918
way better than what we ever were before

709
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,158
so i think that's

710
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,039
the answer is going to be honest if it's

711
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,400
because of that

712
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,080
you're going to you're going to probably

713
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,679
realize that at some point

714
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,799
if you've not been keeping systems up to

715
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,559
date and you've been breached as a

716
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,799
result of that

717
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,918
someone in the organization might be

718
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,280
grumpy about that

719
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,799
particularly if it's the person who's

720
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,039
been telling you for six months to fix

721
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,760
the

722
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,879
fix the vulnerability if that person

723
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,000
comes back and says

724
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,919
you know what they didn't do it and i'm

725
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,520
really sick of not being listened to

726
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,360
and they pick up the you know they go on

727
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,879
social media or they pick up a phone or

728
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,439
an email or whatever and they notify the

729
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,520
media

730
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,799
it's going to get out so i'd say get on

731
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,600
the front foot and say we've done the

732
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,158
wrong thing

733
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,678
but we've fixed the problem gold

734
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:28,000
standard media releases that one good

735
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:31,679
google as a starting template

736
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,440
uh look i'd probably go on

737
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:35,120
i think you need to work backwards for

738
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:36,000
that and work out look at your

739
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,120
particular industry

740
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,480
vertical look for press release look for

741
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,080
the information about breaches that

742
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,679
those companies may have had

743
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,279
and then work backwards at the media

744
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,559
coverage and what you'll find is

745
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:48,480
through the media coverage you'll see

746
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,678
certain statements have been repeated

747
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,360
because they've been picked up from a

748
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,840
press release and reported by multiple

749
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,840
parties

750
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:58,159
um so there's probably no gold standard

751
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,080
the

752
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,679
pr people and particularly people

753
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,399
involved in crisis comms have

754
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:07,840
set ways of doing things and they kind

755
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,200
of guard that as their own ip

756
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,879
what do you think of twitter regular

757
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,200
updates during an incident

758
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,679
be really careful with regular incident

759
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,679
updates

760
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,919
i know from my experience i've been

761
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,240
involved in all sorts of different sorts

762
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:24,559
of system incidents and whether that's a

763
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,320
um an internal hardware failure or an

764
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:28,480
external attack

765
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,158
the facts can change because what you

766
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:32,799
think is true

767
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:34,720
in the first hour could be could be seen

768
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,158
to be completely off the opposite

769
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,320
in another two or three hours once

770
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,520
you've done further investigation

771
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,559
the best answer is to say i think we are

772
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,158
investigating you can tell you that

773
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,760
you're investigating and when we are

774
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,720
certain of what's going on we will

775
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,400
inform

776
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:50,000
and i think that's the best way of doing

777
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,760
things by social media is to say

778
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,039
we're looking into it but we're not

779
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,200
going to speculate

780
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,158
um we know speculation has a mind of its

781
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,320
own

782
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,559
if someone loses if for example let's

783
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:05,279
say your company was breached

784
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:06,639
um and it looked like a external attack

785
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,919
and the first thing that people tend to

786
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,080
do in external attacks is look for

787
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,679
attribution of some sort

788
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,279
and then you come back two hours later

789
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:14,799
and you say uh actually it wasn't a

790
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,720
breach um

791
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,000
we did something wrong ourselves a great

792
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,600
example of that is what happened with

793
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
the census a few years ago

794
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,039
um you know the government department

795
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,679
involved

796
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,960
um came out and screamed dd you know

797
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,720
screen ddos

798
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,000
and then what we actually found was bad

799
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:33,200
system design

800
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,720
um so don't speculate unless you know

801
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,640
for sure

802
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,000
so when it comes to twitter people want

803
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,279
information fast

804
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,799
you need to make the decision about

805
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,600
whether you want to inform fast you want

806
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:45,279
to inform right

807
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,719
companies that are on pentester view is

808
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,440
the rules ceo

809
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,200
look we do practice yeah practice is

810
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,400
really really important

811
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:57,120
when when i was involved in bcp and

812
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:59,520
dr are planning we used to do really

813
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:02,080
exhaustive end-to-end exercises but they

814
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,440
very rarely went as far as saying now

815
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,760
we're going to put you in front of a

816
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,440
front of a camera and a microphone i i

817
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:10,158
think it's really important

818
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,600
to say to get to actually do that

819
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,760
education and training

820
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,039
um and you know unashamed plug that's

821
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,919
what we do at media wise one of the

822
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:19,039
things we do

823
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,480
is actually train execs through comms

824
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,799
through their communications during an

825
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:24,080
incident

826
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,840
so yeah i would say if you're doing a

827
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,039
pen test or anything like that treat it

828
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,879
as real

829
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,400
and get get the person who's going to be

830
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:32,559
your spokesperson up there

831
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,600
i unless you if your ceo's a really good

832
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,520
media performer

833
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,520
go for it i guess if they're probably

834
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,279
going to want to be up front

835
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:41,760
but you probably need a filter in front

836
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,279
of your ceo to deal with the

837
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,720
the hundreds of questions that may come

838
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,480
depending on the on the type of breach

839
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,480
you've had

840
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,000
from your view is it true that people

841
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,799
care more about how you handle a breach

842
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:57,279
than that you've had a breach um

843
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:59,360
i think the answer to that is yes

844
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,960
but it's also a question of was the

845
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,399
breach because you did something really

846
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,240
really dumb

847
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:09,520
uh you know

848
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:12,080
like for example you know if you look at

849
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:14,000
that red cross blood bank incident

850
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,600
something that could have been handled

851
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,799
really really badly

852
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,879
and it could have looked it could have

853
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,240
come up really really poorly if

854
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,919
the answer that question i guess is

855
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,159
about how you handle bridges if you

856
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:25,840
handle the breach really well

857
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,919
then the answer is how you handle it

858
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,399
will become the story

859
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,279
if you handle the breach poorly the

860
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,199
breach

861
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:34,720
and the data loss and the impact on

862
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,679
customers or business partners or

863
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:38,159
whoever

864
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,000
that becomes the story if you think

865
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:40,799
about the red cross story if the answer

866
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,399
had been

867
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,480
wasn't our fault we're blaming the

868
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:46,799
contractor um

869
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,000
our notification process was really poor

870
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,679
we didn't get you know if the blood if

871
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,679
the blood bank hadn't notified people by

872
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,720
email and text and people page ads in

873
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,159
newspapers

874
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,919
um if their response had been bad the

875
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,679
breach would have been the news

876
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,399
but five years later people are talking

877
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:03,279
about how they handled it

878
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:05,279
as a case study in you know handling a

879
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:09,120
breach really well

880
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:11,360
uh sophisticated attack um

881
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,719
as someone who's reported on it security

882
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,080
for over a decade

883
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:17,679
um when i see sophisticated attack i

884
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,320
i'm not sure if i'm allowed to swear or

885
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:23,840
not but i tend to think

886
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:26,240
uh what i see now is that the

887
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,840
attack vectors haven't especially

888
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:31,760
changed ransomware's still a big thing

889
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,840
uh you know

890
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,960
most of the you know ddos is still a big

891
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,918
thing i think what's happening is the

892
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,679
attackers are getting it just

893
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,960
the attackers are getting smarter

894
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,039
because they've learned how not to

895
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,399
use typos in their phishing emails and

896
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,320
stuff like that

897
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,320
um so from that perspective they have

898
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,480
become more sophisticated

899
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,520
but the attack vectors haven't changed

900
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,960
especially

901
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,879
so when i hear about sophisticated

902
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,799
attack i kind of think

903
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,399
was it really sophisticated or did you

904
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,918
really um

905
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,279
were you just fooled by someone who was

906
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:00,640
a little bit you know who's picked up

907
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,159
their game slightly and you

908
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,880
and whatever barriers you've had to

909
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:07,200
block them haven't been as good

910
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,559
um what do you think of twitter regular

911
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,640
updates during a report

912
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:12,480
as i said before i think that one's

913
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,200
popped back in hang on a sec

914
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,559
um people care more about how you handle

915
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,320
i think i've been through all those

916
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,678
questions

917
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,639
does anyone else have anything else

918
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,640
they'd like to ask

919
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,360
oh that's what's happened someone's

920
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,720
removing questions i've answered that's

921
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,719
why the list changed on me

922
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:35,039
well with that i'd hand back over to

923
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,480
aaron and

924
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,158
thanks very much everybody for giving us

925
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,399
this opportunity to chat i think this is

926
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,530
a really really critical area

927
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:44,080
um on mask uh

928
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:45,760
[Music]

929
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,158
i think we're about to wind up i might

930
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:50,240
take that question offline if um

931
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,279
i'm gonna hop over to one of the tables

932
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,799
shortly

933
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:54,960
um so i think you'll find me i'm gonna

934
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,559
go to table 12. i think

935
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,320
if i say that hopefully people will find

936
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:01,760
me there and i'll answer that question

937
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,279
um over there i think that's from yvette

938
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,200
so i'll do that when i come back in

939
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:06,640
