achieving

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,600
least privileged access for your

10
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,279
structured and unstructured data systems

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,199
so guys when you're ready take it away i

12

is going to be our presenter today but

21
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,760
just want to hop

22
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:44,959

uh but we're going to be presenting uh

28
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,199
achieving least privileged access

29
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,120
uh for your structured data repositories

30
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,039
i'm going to leave the stage and allow

31
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,879
adam the time to present but i will be

32
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,559
following along with the chat

33
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,798
uh making sure to follow along with the

34
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,520
q a so please feel free

35
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,840
um and uh we'll just get started so with

36
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,280
that

37
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,799
adam take it away very good so

38
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,960
i'm gonna go over a handful of things

39
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:18,400
today but really the the core of the

40
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,240
presentation is about

41
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,320
achieving a least privileged model

42
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,360
across the data sets that are most

43
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,360
critical to your

44
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,360
organization those could be structured

45
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,840
data it could be unstructured data

46
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,439
um probably spend more time on the

47
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,759
unstructured than the structure but you

48
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,520
know

49
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,040
at some point i'll open it up for

50
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,119
questions um

51
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,720
and you know i can address anything

52
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:40,960
that's on your mind so

53
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,000
really this is you know kind of a

54
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,158
two-pronged

55
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
presentation here about um some

56
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,759
strategies that i could recommend

57
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,680
based on my experience working with all

58
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,600
different kinds of organizations and

59
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,119
i can show you through the lens of the

60
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,720
stealth bits platform how we

61
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,320
address these particular things but a

62
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,880
lot of what i'm going to tell you is is

63
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,919
general

64
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,399
and you know not necessarily you know

65
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,479
just about using our software so

66
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,159
a little bit about stealth bits we've

67
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,919
been around for a long time and

68
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,160
really what we believe is important is

69
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,839
taking a holistic view at securing your

70
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,440
data and that means considering

71
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:18,319
the credentials that grant access to

72
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,079
that data as well as the systems

73
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,560
that underlie that data because there

74
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,319
are a lot of exploitable permissions in

75
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,160
all of those places so you've got the

76
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,238
data itself and the associated access

77
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,560
control list you've got active directory

78
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,239
and the different group memberships um

79
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,599
you know associated with that access but

80
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,120
going even deeper than that

81
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,280
there are all kinds of security settings

82
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,879
that can be misconfigured in ad

83
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,480
and you want to have visibility into

84
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,000
where those things can be exploited to

85
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,560
gain access to your data

86
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,760
maybe i don't have access to your

87
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,720
account numbers

88
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,000
but i can reset the password of another

89
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,920
user who could change a group

90
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
membership that would in turn grant

91
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,920
access to that critical information so

92
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
those attack maps are important to keep

93
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,839
in mind um and consider the

94
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,920
the systems themselves in that equation

95
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,400
as well maybe i don't have access to

96
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,559
your critical information just yet but i

97
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,400
can add myself to a security group

98
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,239
that'll make me an administrator

99
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,400
on the server that has the content and i

100
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,200
can take ownership give myself rice to

101
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,599
that data

102
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,359
so when we talk about um systems

103
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,319
credentials and data that's what we mean

104
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,360
it's all part of

105
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,319
securing the data itself so

106
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,599
just to set the table with some of the

107
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,958
terminology that i'm going to use

108
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,000
throughout if you hear me say data

109
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,000
access governance

110
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,480
what i'm talking about is the principle

111
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,760
of making access to data exclusive right

112
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,440
that everyone should have

113
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,319
the level of privilege they need to do

114
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,560
their job nothing more nothing less

115
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,238
data access governance there are a

116
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,040
handful of things that

117
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,959
are typically in the way of achieving

118
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,959
that if you think about the complexity

119
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,080
of the entitlement structures uh you

120
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,640
know particularly

121
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,040
on certain legacy systems like um

122
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,319
windows filers and nas devices and those

123
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,040
types of things it could be rather

124
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,879
complex

125
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,720
but also things like sharepoint have you

126
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,720
know 36 different permission levels

127
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,040
involved in databases can be complicated

128
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,400
too

129
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:07,840
so it really applies across the board um

130
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,680
you know that goes hand in hand with

131
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,360
excessive access you've got movers and

132
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,400
levers throughout the

133
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,560
organization who had rights at one point

134
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,519
probably don't need those rights anymore

135
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,839
um

136
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,840
people are always very quick to uh to

137
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,679
sound the alarm when they need access to

138
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,198
something and they don't have it but

139
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,360
how often have you seen someone raise

140
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,320
their hand to give access back when they

141
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,080
don't need it anymore

142
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,759
right so that's that's how those things

143
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,758
accumulate over time

144
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,600
and result in all kinds of unknown risks

145
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,440
and compliance issues

146
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,880
so that's data access governance in a

147
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,000
nutshell

148
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,479
i want to talk through uh the approach

149
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,440
that we take to really get all of that

150
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,199
under control

151
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,880
and achieve least privilege across these

152
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,000
different things so there are five

153
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,680
phases to it

154
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,280
in summary at least you know when we

155
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,800
break these things down there are some

156
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,080
nuances to it depending on which

157
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,360
platforms you're dealing with

158
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,440
you know whether it's a database or a

159
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,600
file system uh

160
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,719
collaboration platform like sharepoint

161
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,560
or onedrive or

162
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,840
teams everything of course works a

163
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,080
little bit differently but

164
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:09,198
these general principles are still

165
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,359
applicable

166
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,960
so number one is just discovering what

167
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,000
you've got and i mean that in the in the

168
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,638
broadest sense

169
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,440
possible you want to do host discovery

170
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,280
um you know

171
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,960
across your on-prem infrastructure as

172
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,520
well as any systems you have in the

173
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,159
cloud

174
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,719
and take inventory of where do you have

175
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:29,039
you know maybe s3 buckets in amazon and

176
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,800
which of the windows machines on your

177
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,080
network might have file shares hanging

178
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,880
off of them probably more than you

179
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,960
expect

180
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,120
where do you have sql instances where

181
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,880
you have databases in the cloud

182
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,560
so all kinds of things like that is

183
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,479
starting with that discovery of just

184
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,240
knowing the purpose of each machine that

185
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,919
you're dealing with this is an exchange

186
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,280
server there's a sharepoint farm there's

187
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,080
a sql server

188
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,799
that's really discovery in the most

189
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,880
fundamental

190
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,160
level and then you start to collect and

191
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,479
analyze right so you

192
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,759
this is where we bring back relevant

193
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,840
data points and

194
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,800
start to classify things like what data

195
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,039
is sensitive

196
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,840
who has access to that data how long has

197
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,080
it been there

198
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,520
and you can start to prioritize things

199
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,840
at this level

200
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,639
but going a step further um it's

201
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,880
important to

202
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,919
analyze how that content is actually

203
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,680
being utilized

204
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,960
so that's where activity monitoring

205
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,479
comes into place and

206
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,318
this serves a number of different

207
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,240
purposes but you know for

208
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,919
for the sake of you know proactively

209
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,199
achieving at least privileged model

210
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,280
uh the most important thing we're going

211
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,000
to do with this is compare

212
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,919
the level of rights granted at present

213
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,639
to how these people have behaved in the

214
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,758
past

215
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,600
so if you've got a repository where

216
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,000
um you know hundreds of people have

217
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,960
access and maybe only dozens of people

218
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,680
are navigating that repository maybe 20

219
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,758
people

220
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,520
are making changes to files and another

221
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,000
50 people are just reading the files

222
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,840
well

223
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,759
you know the rest of those folks can be

224
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:54,719
removed without any impact

225
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,520
to their day-to-day operations and

226
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,400
that's where

227
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,039
restructuring access comes into place so

228
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,039
to achieve

229
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,080
least privilege it's not you can't just

230
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:03,680
simply rip away

231
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,199
those people that aren't using their

232
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,199
rights it's usually

233
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,759
quite a bit more complicated than that

234
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,520
some security groups are being shared

235
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,199
for other purposes i'm sure you've seen

236
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,960
it where you've got multi-purpose

237
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,800
security groups on an access control

238
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,198
list or some people directly assigned

239
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,840
and

240
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,759
all kinds of um complicated conditions

241
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,599
that make it not so trivial just to

242
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,880
take someone away even even if you know

243
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,319
they don't belong so

244
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,000
we're going to talk about how to

245
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,759
untangle that

246
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,039
and really implement the right model

247
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:32,720
that's going to make this better to

248
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,199
manage going forward

249
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,000
and then that leads us into the fifth

250
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,039
phase which is

251
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,039
governing on an ongoing basis to ensure

252
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,039
security and compliance and operational

253
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:45,199
standards and and what i mean by that is

254
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,159
you go to the trouble to make sure

255
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,000
you've got

256
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,599
uh the right groups on the right access

257
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,560
control lists and the right people in

258
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,759
the right groups

259
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,759
and that those groups are only

260
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,039
controlling those resources and the

261
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,360
people in those groups

262
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:59,120
are only the people that need to have

263
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,720
access to that particular thing

264
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,400
well that can all fall apart rather

265
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,759
quickly if you don't put the

266
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,679
governance workflows in place to

267
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,639
maintain it going forward so you want to

268
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,960
get

269
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,960
the people responsible for that content

270
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,680
involved in making those decisions and

271
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,719
figure out

272
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:17,440
who's responsible for what make them um

273
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,639
attest to that on an ongoing basis so

274
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,039
monthly or quarterly

275
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,560
you want these folks to perform reviews

276
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,479
where they can say

277
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,000
um you know this person doesn't need

278
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,440
rights anymore they've moved on to

279
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,400
another department or they've left the

280
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,240
organization or

281
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,440
whatever the case may be and you want to

282
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,039
be able to account for all the

283
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,440
exceptions along the way

284
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,559
so that's going to be kind of the core

285
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,560
of the presentation

286
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,479
and if we have time i'll get into some

287
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,479
other tangentially related things that

288
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,920
it that i think might be of value

289
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,360
um you know certainly activity

290
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,000
monitoring serves a lot of other

291
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,760
purposes

292
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,200
both to have an audit trail to

293
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,279
restructure access

294
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,680
but also just to proactively stop

295
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,959
attacks and abuse of that content so we

296
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,120
could talk a little bit about

297
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,560
user behavior analytics if we have time

298
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,680
and responding to those things with

299
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,399
playbooks

300
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,160
um and then if we have time at the end

301
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,760
i'll talk about data mapping as well

302
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,240
right if we go to the trouble

303
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,800
of finding sensitive content there you

304
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,800
know some

305
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,560
some other benefits along those lines

306
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,199
too but first and foremost

307
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,560
i want to get to the core of what we're

308
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,120
here to talk about today which is

309
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,000
achieving

310
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,240
least privileged access on whatever

311
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,640
types of systems you're working with

312
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,240
so there are three key ingredients to

313
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,480
doing this successfully

314
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,080
first is permissions understanding

315
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:34,399
existing access rights

316
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,320
um is you know really step one of

317
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,519
knowing what's over provisioned

318
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,680
and there are a lot of components to

319
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,320
existing access rights as i alluded to

320
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,800
earlier

321
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,880
but everything from what's on those acls

322
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,560
to nesting conditions inside of those

323
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,160
groups and so forth

324
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,680
then the content you know if you really

325
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,880
can't prioritize risk

326
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,880
if you don't know what kind of content

327
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,080
you're dealing with so what's sensitive

328
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,279
what's regulated

329
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:59,040
where do you have um you know

330
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,959
information that that might be higher

331
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,319
priority and have higher security needs

332
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,518
than others it gives you some semblance

333
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,600
of where to start

334
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,480
and then as i mentioned already activity

335
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,440
right this is how you know the

336
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,360
difference between

337
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,440
who's got rights who's using those

338
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,480
rights

339
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,000
so um really what you want to do is

340
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,839
you know you take a tool like stealth

341
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,880
bits that can analyze those access

342
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,200
control lists

343
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,720
um and keep an audit trail and all those

344
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,160
other good things and

345
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,920
bring together the differential right so

346
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,760
if you want to you can let the platform

347
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,399
you know audit everything that exists

348
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,399
today

349
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,079
see see who's inside of those groups and

350
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,360
groups inside of those groups

351
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,599
and then compare that to that audit

352
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,760
trail who's reading who's writing

353
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,880
who's not using their privileges at all

354
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,839
and that gives you your access

355
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,200
transformation

356
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,760
right now we're going to restructure

357
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,600
those groups

358
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,200
to people who can read people who can

359
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,519
read and write and perhaps you want one

360
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,440
for

361
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,880
administrative purposes a full control

362
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,480
group um

363
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,640
and you want to supply a naming

364
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,120
convention you do this transformation

365
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,000
so typically it's best practice to name

366
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,320
these groups after

367
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,040
the resources that they're governing and

368
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,440
this will

369
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,480
replace any legacy conditions on access

370
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:10,000
control lists

371
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,839
things like um you know

372
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,200
everyone domain users authenticated

373
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,839
users or even

374
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,200
just um groups that are used for a lot

375
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,160
of different purposes right you could

376
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,000
have a group

377
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,199
third floor everybody who worked on that

378
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,640
floor was in this group

379
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,519
and now we're using it to grant access

380
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,199
to things quickly becomes um

381
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,200
you know a mess when you pull that group

382
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:31,600
off the acl you're breaking maybe

383
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,360
someone's access to an application or

384
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,279
something else and that's exactly

385
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,519
what you don't want what you set out to

386
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,680
avoid so just going through that process

387
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,200
really achieves three things eliminating

388
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,040
inadvertent granting or evoking of

389
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,760
access aligning access with

390
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:47,279
these privileged principles and uh

391
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,560
perhaps most importantly positioning the

392
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,240
resources for actionable

393
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,839
actionable governance workflows going

394
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,399
forward too that's what i'm talking

395
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:56,079
about with self-service access requests

396
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,920
entitlement reviews and keeping the

397
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,479
people responsible for that data

398
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,000
involved in the process um a lot of you

399
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,279
are probably thinking right now okay so

400
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,320
if we go to

401
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:08,320
a resource-based group model

402
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,000
what about roles right like i thought we

403
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,440
want to have role-based access

404
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,880
and the answer is both right

405
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,240
particularly as it pertains to

406
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,560
unstructured data

407
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,000
what you want to do is nest those

408
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,680
role-based groups inside the

409
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,480
resource-based groups it's going to

410
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,399
really give you

411
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,399
the best of both worlds so what i mean

412
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,880
by that is maybe today i've got an

413
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:28,560
access control list with an over

414
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,519
permissive group on it we're going to do

415
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,800
that analysis

416
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,600
we're going to figure out which of those

417
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,120
people and roles are actually utilizing

418
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,360
the access that they're granted

419
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,800
via that overleap permissive group

420
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,560
and then we're going to apply those new

421
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,839
rights where not only do we put the

422
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,839
correct people into the correct

423
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:47,600
resource-based groups but now we can

424
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,600
nest roles into those resource-based

425
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,399
groups as well so i've got an accounting

426
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,720
folder

427
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,519
and my accounting admins are going to

428
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,560
need uh

429
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:57,680
right access to that area um and maybe

430
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,119
the

431
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,359
you know head of finance is going to

432
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,639
need right access to that but you know

433
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,760
there are going to be some exceptions to

434
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:05,680
that where somebody from a different

435
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,959
department is working on a project and

436
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,079
they just need access to this one

437
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,439
particular thing

438
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,880
you don't want to give them that entire

439
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,880
role and that's always going to happen

440
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:14,560
with unstructured data

441
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,920
there will never be a scenario with

442
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,800
unstructured data where you don't have

443
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,719
exceptions

444
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,880
and that's why no matter how you achieve

445
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,639
this i recommend this group structure

446
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,639
where you've got a read group a read

447
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,399
write group but nest your

448
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,760
uh your role-based groups inside of

449
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,760
those resource-based groups

450
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,880
um if you just pick you know one

451
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,319
approach or the other

452
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,160
you're going to regret it later on if

453
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,000
you're if you start putting

454
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:37,600
roles directly on those access control

455
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,480
lists um you're

456
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,959
you're going to get yourself into

457
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,399
trouble so do it both ways so you can

458
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:45,599
accommodate both the roles

459
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:48,399
and the exceptions as far as

460
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,320
knowing where to start this is where we

461
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:52,959
talk about risk prioritization

462
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,399
so who's got access is only one

463
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,638
component of risk

464
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,240
right what kind of data resides in this

465
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,600
area we want to do sensitive data

466
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,320
discovery and see

467
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,519
where you have regulated and sensitive

468
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,880
information things

469
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,800
that would pose a risk to the

470
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,000
organization if that content fell into

471
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,160
the wrong hands

472
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,839
but it's not just a matter of how much

473
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,360
sensitive content is there who has

474
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,120
access to the sensitive data

475
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,360
but also how heavily trafficked is this

476
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,000
folder is this a sharepoint site

477
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,800
open to the entire organization or um

478
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,839
you know

479
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:25,599
a folder that is um you know

480
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,360
traffic frequently a sharepoint site

481
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,000
that everybody's navigating on a daily

482
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,839
basis

483
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,040
or some forgotten about folder that

484
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:33,920
maybe has equally

485
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,519
um you know inappropriate um rights

486
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,040
assigned to it but nobody knows it's

487
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,199
there and only a couple people are

488
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,399
are traversing it on a daily basis so

489
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,160
those things uh

490
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,079
you know should all be taken into

491
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,760
account when you're determining what

492
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,439
data is most at risk

493
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,240
certainly higher concentration of

494
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,480
sensitive data and more exposed areas

495
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:54,000
um that are heavier traffic they're

496
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,680
certainly going to be the highest risk

497
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,079
but this gives you some semblance of

498
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,040
priority you know in addition to the

499
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,319
amount and um how sensitive it is and

500
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,079
who has access to it

501
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:06,880
you also want to think about how heavily

502
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:09,680
trafficked those areas are

503
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:11,439
so then it comes to who ought to be

504
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,880
responsible for this content who should

505
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,600
make those decisions and

506
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,320
usually not us right you know within the

507
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,880
business

508
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,480
uh everything belongs to somebody and

509
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,959
it's important to figure out who those

510
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,959
people are

511
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,800
so you can put them in charge of making

512
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,399
decisions and not only ensure proper

513
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:31,359
security going forward but

514
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,759
maintain an immutable audit trail of who

515
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,040
has approved which access decisions and

516
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:37,519
when and why

517
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,240
a proper justification associated with

518
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,160
that

519
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,000
so in this scenario um let's let's

520
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,880
calculate ownership on a resource

521
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,920
this guy adam has created most of the

522
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,680
content

523
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,599
um within this area right so he's the

524
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:51,599
owner of all those documents

525
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,279
but then we look deeper and you see

526
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:56,399
george is responsible for

527
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,519
85 of the activity in that area so we

528
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,680
know who's put it there

529
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,360
we know who works with it the most uh

530
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,758
the other thing we want to pivot on is

531
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,440
who do those people report to right so

532
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,880
if one person made the content another

533
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,120
person uses most of it

534
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:11,279
and they both report to the same manager

535
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:15,519
odds are that manager is probably the

536
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:17,439
the proper custodian of this data um so

537
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,839
that's the path we want to take and you

538
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,160
want to you know confirm and verify

539
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:23,440
meaning emails go out to those suspected

540
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,920
owners and they say

541
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,160
yes this is mine or no it's not um so

542
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,560
you could do those ownership assignments

543
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,759
and then once we've assigned owners to

544
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,599
the different content

545
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,680
you want them to participate in these

546
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:39,440
decisions on an ongoing basis

547
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:41,439
so we've got this guy um

548
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,759
you know george here who still has

549
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,800
access to the data he's got full control

550
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:47,279
rights in fact

551
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,040
but um no activity he hasn't done

552
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:50,480
anything with this data in a long time

553
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,319
or maybe you've got somebody who's

554
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,880
reading but not writing right similar

555
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,199
insights

556
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,040
to what we use for automated remediation

557
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,959
but now just rolling this up

558
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,160
to the person responsible on a regular

559
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,479
basis so

560
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,559
i own this content i get an email that

561
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,240
says it's time to review

562
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,760
who's got access to your content and

563
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,439
aside from these little hints here

564
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,119
it's mine i'm familiar with it right

565
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,520
this is my department or my

566
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,119
data repository i can say oh susan's

567
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,480
moved off to another team and

568
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:20,879
ruthie doesn't work here anymore um so

569
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,240
this is giving me the context necessary

570
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,079
to make those decisions and

571
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,000
having the right person make those

572
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,918
decisions um is key as

573
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,600
along with you know providing any notes

574
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,160
associated with why those decisions were

575
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,159
made

576
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,440
especially when new rights are granted

577
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:36,000
right uh the kind of

578
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,840
the next evolution from this is uh you

579
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
know self-service access requests

580
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,879
or you empower the end users to ask for

581
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,400
what they want

582
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,400
you know through a web portal and they

583
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,000
could plug in a note and say i need this

584
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,240
because my job requires

585
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,840
x y and z or i'm working on a project

586
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,679
then the person responsible for that

587
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:54,240
repository gets an email

588
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,960
approves it or denies it again with a

589
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,120
proper

590
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:59,520
justification provided in the notes so

591
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:03,760
you've always got an audit trail of

592
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:14,400
who's made those decisions so

593
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:16,160
i think we covered this i want to talk

594
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,440
about databases a little bit

595
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,120
so that everything i told you it kind of

596
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,000
applies to both but as a little bit more

597
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,559
specific

598
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,039
with the unstructured content as it

599
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,799
pertains to the databases

600
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,559
there are some some different nuances

601
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,400
involved right same thing complex

602
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,480
entitlements unknown risks excessive

603
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,520
access compliance requirements

604
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,640
but databases um

605
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,720
you know we want to approach it like

606
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,120
this again start with discovery right

607
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,640
where

608
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,399
are their databases throughout your

609
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,559
environment you want to complete

610
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,360
obtain a complete view of your data

611
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,678
footprint so you can collect and analyze

612
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,879
the relevant data points to answer

613
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,360
critical questions

614
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,000
sensitivity access ownership age and

615
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,520
then same thing

616
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,200
but activity for a database is going to

617
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,960
look a little bit different right you're

618
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,720
collecting queries in this case

619
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,120
so you're talking about things like

620
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,039
who's selecting and inserting and

621
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:09,039
and you know things of that nature so

622
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,799
similar conceptually to what we

623
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,840
discussed before but functionally you

624
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,559
know has its own

625
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:15,840
nuances to it uh remediation very

626
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,559
similar thing right

627
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,559
um people who are not actively accessing

628
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:22,000
or modifying these databases don't need

629
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:24,559
to have rights to do so

630
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,559
if someone is reading from a database

631
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,160
but not making changes to it that's also

632
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:29,520
something to consider as well but you

633
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,080
know a little bit a little bit different

634
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,879
than

635
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,600
how we deal with the unstructured data

636
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:37,440
um

637
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:38,959
then again control privilege access to

638
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,799
ensure security compliance and

639
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,400
operational standards are met so

640
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,720
very similar functionally but you know

641
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,480
databases have that that added

642
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,160
complexity where it's not always people

643
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,600
accessing the data you know these

644
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:53,840
accounts often belong to

645
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,840
applications and things like that

646
00:19:54,559 --> 00:20:00,000
so since we have some time left

647
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,200
i also want to talk about data mapping

648
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,559
um

649
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,400
you know we were talking about

650
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,039
discovering sensitive data where do i

651
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,880
have

652
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,480
sensitive or regulated information who

653
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,039
has access to it what are they doing

654
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,200
with it

655
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,960
protecting it from being exfiltrated or

656
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,240
abused and achieving at least privileged

657
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,480
model on that

658
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,360
it's a great place to start but as we

659
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,000
pivot

660
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:21,520
you know into compliance there are other

661
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,200
ways we could utilize those same

662
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,080
capabilities and maybe take it a little

663
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,559
bit farther

664
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:28,158
so security privacy kind of two sides of

665
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,039
the same coin i think starting with

666
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,280
security

667
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,720
is always the right approach and that's

668
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,080
going to facilitate

669
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,159
a lot of the things that are necessary

670
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,760
for data privacy so you know achieving a

671
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:41,360
least privileged access model

672
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,879
is a great start um having a uba for

673
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,120
breach detection and response

674
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,919
is going to help you too but let's take

675
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,840
a step further

676
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:49,120
into the actual mapping of the data

677
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,799
instead of thinking about

678
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,479
where do i have sensitive information

679
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,520
and who has access to it

680
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,240
i want to maintain a map of you know not

681
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,000
just

682
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,600
where is their personally identifiable

683
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,159
information but which

684
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,360
documents and which records uh pertain

685
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,480
to which people

686
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,320
so now think about it like this i've got

687
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,520
on the right hand side here all these

688
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,439
different systems across

689
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,559
my enterprise like we've been talking

690
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,640
about um

691
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:16,559
in the cloud on-prem in databases

692
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,600
structured unstructured collaboration

693
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,520
you name it

694
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:23,280
um then on the left hand side of the

695
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,120
diagram here now what i want to do

696
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,960
is connect to all these different

697
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,520
systems of record and think about

698
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,799
things like salesforce everybody that

699
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,799
i've ever marketed to

700
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,840
and attributes associated with those

701
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:36,080
people uh

702
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,959
maybe my payroll system or my hr

703
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,559
platform

704
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,559
um this could really be anything you

705
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,799
want right that's what i mean by

706
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,080
any id you want to connect to any system

707
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,600
of record that you have

708
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,840
in the enterprise and we're going to

709
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,520
build a map out of those attributes

710
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,240
so what stealth fix does is it connects

711
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:53,760
to all these different systems of record

712
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,919
and it combines the attributes

713
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,799
discovered there to develop subject

714
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,320
profiles

715
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,840
and then we discover those subject

716
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,439
profiles across

717
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,280
all these different platforms you know

718
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,440
i've got a few examples on the slide

719
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,600
also there's any data connector so

720
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,480
anything with the rest api is in scope

721
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,399
essentially

722
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,000
and connect to those platforms and

723
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,720
maintain a map

724
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,120
of um you know which records pertain to

725
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,240
which

726
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,600
individuals so the the effect of that

727
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,919
is i want to be able to search for a

728
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,559
person like tom

729
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,360
and see where across the enterprise tom

730
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,360
is mentioned

731
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,520
not just his name or his address or his

732
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,678
email address or his telephone number

733
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,720
but anything about him right any of his

734
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,720
attributes from

735
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,080
any of these systems here should trigger

736
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,159
a match for tom

737
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,760
so that's what we accomplish here by

738
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,159
approaching the problem this way

739
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,760
and maintaining a map on an ongoing

740
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,440
basis right every time a record is

741
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,360
updated we keep track of it

742
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,440
and that way at any time i could search

743
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,678
for a person get an instant answer

744
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,280
where across my enterprise across

745
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:56,960
sharepoint file system

746
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:58,960
databases um s3 buckets whatever the

747
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,559
case may be

748
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,880
where is tom mentioned right i need to

749
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,960
search for him and i need to know

750
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,480
which files and database records pertain

751
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,000
to him what's been done with that

752
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:10,000
information recently who has

753
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,200
access to it and perhaps kick off a

754
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:16,000
workflow to put that on restriction or

755
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:17,120
you know handle it in some way whether

756
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:19,520
it's just reporting

757
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,799
or actually making it accessible or

758
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,840
removing it or

759
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,639
copying it to another location so that's

760
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:26,480
what i mean

761
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,720
by going beyond just sensitive data

762
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,280
discovery and pivoting to

763
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,640
full-blown data mapping right and taking

764
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,360
all the different system of

765
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,360
systems of record that are involved so

766
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,479
that you can build out subject profiles

767
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,080
of different people

768
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,799
within the enterprise and make sure

769
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,360
you're

770
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,400
you know prepared to respond to those

771
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,678
types of inquiries

772
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,600
so those are really the four pillars

773
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,640
when we tie data privacy and data

774
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,120
security together

775
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,720
achieving least privileged access is in

776
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,840
my opinion the most important thing it's

777
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,000
what i would do first

778
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,918
right um you know especially for a lot

779
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,400
of the privacy regulations

780
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,919
um around the world achieving at least

781
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,039
privilege access model is going to help

782
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,400
you in a big way

783
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,240
but you know breach detection and

784
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,520
response being able to fulfill data

785
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,679
subject access requests

786
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,559
all very important and of course

787
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,960
fulfilling subject access requests is

788
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,480
much much simpler if you are maintaining

789
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,480
a data map of again

790
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,480
which records pertain to which people

791
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,600
across all the different systems across

792
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,200
your enterprise

793
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,399
so with that i want to open up the floor

794
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,559
for questions and

795
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,840
address anything in more detail so tell

796
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,840
me what's on your mind

797
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:39,600
hey adam thanks yeah i'm i'm monitoring

798
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,360
the uh the the chat log here there is

799
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,320
one question that we can start with in a

800
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,479
green

801
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,520
how do you begin to evaluate the access

802
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,799
mechanisms

803
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:51,039
users need etc with data

804
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,158
dispersal in a hybrid environment i

805
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,520
think you touched on a little bit of

806
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,720
that but if you go in a little bit more

807
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,840
depth

808
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,360
yeah that's awesome so i think

809
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,760
i went over this part kind of quickly

810
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:03,439
before but whether you're cleaning up

811
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,600
an existing environment or starting

812
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,000
green field it's all about

813
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,799
choosing the right model that is going

814
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,279
to be

815
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,559
conducive to ongoing governance so what

816
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,000
i mean by the right model is

817
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,600
obviously not the picture on the left

818
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,400
but the picture on the right

819
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,918
so i've got an accounting share here i'm

820
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,880
using just traditional file shares as

821
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,880
the example

822
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:25,360
and i've got you know accounting people

823
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:27,360
who can read other group accounting

824
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,639
read write and modify accounting full

825
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,559
control so

826
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,000
named after in this case the server the

827
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,279
share and the level of access

828
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,840
you can do your naming convention

829
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:37,919
however you want but consistency is key

830
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,199
so i've chosen to go with these explicit

831
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:42,720
resource-based groups

832
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,720
and then nest the roles within

833
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:46,400
this is applicable to other types of

834
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,720
systems as well so if you're starting

835
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:51,919
greenfield with a new sharepoint farm

836
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:54,000
or some other system same deal right

837
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,120
um all the more reason to to get it

838
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,200
right the first time

839
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,239
yeah we could run these remediations and

840
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,760
clean it up later

841
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,520
but starting with the correct structure

842
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,360
in place is

843
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,639
absolutely critical and then we can

844
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,240
start to make decisions about who

845
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,840
belongs in those groups

846
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,000
and that might take some behavioral

847
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,600
monitoring over time right

848
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,120
usually that's a problem that

849
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,360
accumulates gradually

850
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,879
where you know day one i think the

851
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,320
accounting team is going to be the only

852
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,120
group with access to the accounting

853
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,799
folder but then

854
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,320
as people from other business units

855
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,760
start requesting access for

856
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,360
i'm working on a project or i'm doing

857
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:28,080
this or i'm doing that um

858
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,039
you can kind of prevent the problem from

859
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,480
occurring by

860
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:31,919
having good governance workflows in

861
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,880
place and granting people temporary

862
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,720
access where

863
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,360
if you're doing a project for 90 days

864
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,880
your access will expire in 90 days

865
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,639
but you know even if you don't do that

866
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,480
by maintaining an audit trail

867
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,760
is going to help you fix this later on

868
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,520
so i start with the right group

869
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:48,158
structure you know i go at this

870
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,918
you know with the best of intentions but

871
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,559
one way or another you know movers and

872
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,520
levers and

873
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,120
other problems start to result in over

874
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,918
permissive access over time

875
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,879
i could always go back and um you know

876
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,279
run this again

877
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,799
right who's reading who's writing who

878
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,320
hasn't used their access at all

879
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,080
you know after that resource has been

880
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,840
there for six months or nine months or a

881
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,678
year whatever the case may be but

882
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,360
you know starting with the right group

883
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,400
structure helps you get it right the

884
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,158
first time

885
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,520
um and then you could always go back and

886
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,360
you know start to run some

887
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,600
automated routines to clean it up once

888
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:22,399
you have some behavioral history to base

889
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:22,399
those decisions on

890
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:30,000
just get my mic on excellent thank you

891
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,679
very much adam so we have

892
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,279
in fact there was another question posed

893
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,320
just around some of the challenges in

894
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,720
terms of

895
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,000
assigning ad group ownership i think

896
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,240
that you know you've been touched a

897
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,360
little bit

898
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,760
that lot uh explanation there's another

899
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:47,840
question uh that came up in the chat uh

900
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,240
i see this works well for file shares

901
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,320
however sharepoint doesn't lend itself

902
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,640
as well to resource groups

903
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,720
can you discuss that yeah so sharepoint

904
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,640
has a number of complexities to it

905
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,399
everything from the number of different

906
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,159
permission levels involved

907
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,239
to now with sharepoint online you've got

908
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,399
internal and external sharing right

909
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,760
so that would be my highest priority

910
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,279
thing is you know looking for things

911
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,960
like external sharing and

912
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,559
making sure that doesn't exist in any

913
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,320
areas where you've got certain types of

914
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:16,879
sensitive or regulated content that'll

915
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,200
be my my first check when i look at

916
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,919
sharepoint online and onedrive and then

917
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,200
and that type of thing

918
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,200
but i think the the question

919
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,120
specifically was does it still lend

920
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,520
itself to resource-based groups

921
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,639
and i think um in a different way it

922
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,760
does right

923
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:35,600
um but i think there's it's a little bit

924
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,399
more forgiving in terms of you can have

925
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:40,399
a role

926
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:42,158
directly applied in sharepoint um

927
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,760
and then individually assign people i

928
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,840
think it's less of a problem

929
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,879
to individually assign people outside of

930
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,360
those roles you know

931
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,080
directly on the resource in sharepoint

932
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,840
than it is

933
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,760
on you know in something like a file

934
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,639
system right in file system i think it's

935
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,679
really important to have that

936
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:58,480
resource-based group because there's

937
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,320
it's just

938
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,399
too difficult to manage the directly

939
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:04,080
assigned users where with sharepoint

940
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,520
it's not as sloppy right i think you

941
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,720
could have even though there's all those

942
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,879
different permission levels

943
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,000
you could conceivably get away with

944
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,279
having a role

945
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,799
and then some individuals placed

946
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,440
directly but i wouldn't do that on the

947
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,440
file system

948
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:21,039
uh fantastic i'm strongest uh the other

949
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,559
thing i'd add there is the

950
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,000
you know the file systems like the

951
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,960
windows servers and the nas devices and

952
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,880
those types of things

953
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,000
tend to run into the most exceptions

954
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,919
right you know people

955
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,440
people needing access outside of their

956
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,279
particular roles whereas

957
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,880
you know the users are a little bit more

958
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,360
agile with these things in a sharepoint

959
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,360
environment

960
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,679
excellent yes so um uh in addition there

961
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,760
was

962
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,039
an interest in kind of going back to the

963
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,640
gdpr slide some

964
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,320
some of the information around data

965
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,039
privacy and that stuff

966
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,960
we are coming close on time yeah so if

967
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,000
we could just maybe quickly revisit some

968
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,919
of the the privacy

969
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,440
stuff i do want to make sure that we

970
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:00,240
have time to get into

971
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:01,760
uh some of the next steps items as well

972
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,640
yeah was there a specific question on

973
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,720
that

974
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,080
no just uh just a request to revisit it

975
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,600
i i don't know if you if we just want to

976
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,639
just pull that back up real quick yeah

977
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,959
in terms of yeah

978
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,880
just lights could be any privacy

979
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,200
regulation someone said gdpr

980
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,919
and certainly um you know every every

981
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,360
country has

982
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:21,360
different version of this right um but

983
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,559
some of the the basic concepts supply

984
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,240
like when you talk about things like

985
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,639
privacy by design

986
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:28,240
um how much time you have for breach

987
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,360
detection and response those things are

988
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,600
going to be pretty standard

989
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,399
i don't really talk too much about this

990
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,399
item here

991
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:36,479
when i say breach detection and response

992
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:38,158
i'm talking about being able to detect

993
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,760
proactively if something is accessed

994
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:42,240
inappropriately so

995
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,158
using user behavior analytics to catch

996
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:46,240
an exfiltration attempt in flight

997
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,520
or someone is just behaving suspiciously

998
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,399
and looking at content in a way they

999
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,918
normally don't

1000
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:52,080
you want to have the investigation

1001
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:54,640
facilities to say definitively

1002
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:56,639
um who looked at this data and when and

1003
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,279
ideally catch it proactively if such a

1004
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:00,960
thing was

1005
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:01,600
inappropriate um but even more proactive

1006
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,039
than that

1007
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,959
is just implementing a least privileged

1008
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:06,158
model like we've we've focused on this

1009
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,480
far

1010
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:10,000
and then data mapping i think maybe this

1011
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,480
is the part you wanted me to go back to

1012
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,240
but

1013
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,000
building a map across the entire

1014
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,519
enterprise because you could have data

1015
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,399
in so many different places

1016
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:20,159
right now with azure and amazon and

1017
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,158
everything else

1018
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,679
you've got databases and collaboration

1019
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:25,600
platforms and all kinds of different

1020
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,279
things where content can exist

1021
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,760
when i talk about subject profiles what

1022
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:31,200
i mean is pre-indexing attributes for

1023
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,120
the different systems of record

1024
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:34,480
within your enterprise so you know every

1025
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,479
attribute about a person

1026
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,080
when i search for dan i don't just want

1027
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,440
to see files that have his name or have

1028
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,879
his address or whatever

1029
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,480
i want to see files that have any of

1030
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,320
dan's attributes from the different

1031
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:47,200
systems that i'm connected to

1032
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,320
so data mapping is the practice of

1033
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,559
maintaining a map

1034
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,559
of where these subject profiles exist

1035
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:53,440
across all these different systems in

1036
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,039
your enterprise

1037
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,880
so that when you get asked the question

1038
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,480
you give a complete answer where do we

1039
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,200
have records pertaining to tom

1040
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,240
there are 2 435 places where we make

1041
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:04,159
mention of tom

1042
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,760
and that's inclusive of all the

1043
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,320
different systems in our enterprise and

1044
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,320
we could

1045
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:10,080
attest to the fact that it's accurate we

1046
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:14,000
can put that data on restriction

1047
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:16,158
if um if needed for compliance purposes

1048
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,760
is really interesting to consider uh one

1049
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,840
of the compliance

1050
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,879
uh responses we've had at one of the

1051
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:23,279
larger uh

1052
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:24,080
u.s based financial institutions was

1053
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,399
around

1054
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,678
an individual's christmas carts because

1055
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,039
they contained

1056
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,720
you know address and personal

1057
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,158
information so um

1058
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,760
you know i think that's a really really

1059
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,440
interesting point um

1060
