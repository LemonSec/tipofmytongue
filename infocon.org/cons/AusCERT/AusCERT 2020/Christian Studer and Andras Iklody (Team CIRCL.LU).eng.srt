um with their presentation on uh missed

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,319
threat sharing and new features

18
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,559
now this is a recorded presentation but

19
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,680
both christian and andres will be around

20

to field some questions so feel free to

22
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,200
pose questions throughout and

23
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:53,360
we'll deal with them at the end so i'll

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,360
hand it over and to christian and andres

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,719
welcome to our miss statues update talk

26
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,879
where we explore what has changed since

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,000
last year oh third

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,880
in regards to miss i'm christian

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:11,119
and i'm here with andras we both work

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,000
for a circle the luxembourgish national

31
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,400
search for the private

32
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,400
sector

33
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,080
circle is an organization found

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,240
by the ministry of economy to build

35
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,439
cyber security for the luxembourgish

36
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,479
private sector

37
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:30,720
and among our duties we are also

38
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,439
building various security tools for the

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,600
community

40
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,240
such as misp where we lead the

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,559
development effort

42
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,520
we also run several sharing communities

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,960
using misf

44
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,439
for various sectors and trust groups

45
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,559
and as such we're both the driving force

46
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,880
behind the development

47
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,880
as well as power user of the tools

48
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,280
the aim of today's presentation is to

49
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,960
give a quick

50
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,640
introduction into what miss is

51
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,039
in the first place for those new to it

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,600
and then proceed to go through what has

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,160
happened around misp over the past year

54
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,440
we will also take a look at what we are

55
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,440
planning in terms

56
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,280
of development for the coming time

57
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,920
so let's take a look at what miss

58
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,920
actually does

59
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,239
first

60
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,920
if we had to define what misp is the

61
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,080
closest description

62
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,119
would be a threat information sharing

63
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,239
platform so basically a tip

64
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:38,560
with a with a strong focus on sharing

65
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,560
the software is free and open source

66
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,760
the main purpose of the platform is to

67
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,920
collect information sharing

68
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,799
from various different sources which

69
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,839
could

70
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,000
be the outcome of your own

71
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,200
investigations

72
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,640
encoded by your analysts automatically

73
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,280
created data by your tooling

74
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,399
information shared by your peers or

75
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,720
obtained via

76
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,120
os ins and vendors feeds

77
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,400
this information is then normalized and

78
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,959
reached

79
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,920
and correlated to get the most of the

80
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,280
data you collect

81
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,679
in the above mentioned mentioned ways

82
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,959
misp also has a strong focus on

83
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,680
collaboration

84
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,720
so you can work with your peers on

85
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,519
refining the information

86
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,200
finally all of this information is used

87
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,680
to automatically feed

88
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,440
your protective tools for the purpose of

89
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,319
detection prevention

90
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,319
and analysis

91
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,599
in order to achieve all of the above

92
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,040
we have a list of features that support

93
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,518
the entire workflow

94
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,120
in many different ways just to highlight

95
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,440
a few

96
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,720
we have an extensive api that makes

97
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,560
integration easy

98
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,000
both on the producing and the common

99
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,599
search consumption

100
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,560
side as well as a host of automatic

101
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,920
functionalities that generate insights

102
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,400
about the data

103
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:08,399
such such as the correlation engine

104
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:16,639
mist mist's primary focus

105
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:20,639
is in is the exchange of information

106
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:23,120
which it achieves via a mess to miss

107
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,320
synchronization system along with

108
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,440
granular data distribution settings

109
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:32,560
ensuring that your data reaches

110
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,280
the all intended recipients and the

111
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,320
intended

112
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,840
recipients only

113
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:42,240
immediately once it is ready to be

114
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,400
shared

115
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,360
since exchanging information with

116
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,440
machines

117
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,479
is only half of the story we also

118
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,360
provide a bunch

119
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:53,440
of visualization tools to make

120
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,720
understanding and working with the data

121
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,919
more easy for analysts including a graph

122
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,280
representation of

123
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,320
all data dashboarding and various

124
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,679
statistics

125
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:08,400
overlaid as for

126
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,800
interconnecting miss with your tools we

127
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,719
offer

128
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,880
a bunch of different import and export

129
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,800
formats to make the feeding

130
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,440
of ideas ips's themes

131
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,560
host scanners analysis tools and

132
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,479
firewalls

133
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:26,400
straightforward so that's basically it

134
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,520
for a quick explanation of what miss

135
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,560
is if you want more details about it you

136
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,599
can have a look at

137
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,800
miss project.org or

138
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,360
our github page or even watch our last

139
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,479
year's

140
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,199
awesome presentation now let's take a

141
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,479
look at

142
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,479
what changed since our last presentation

143
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,520
some numbers here first in regard to the

144
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,479
activity of

145
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,799
our development community we've had

146
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,318
released

147
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:03,360
we've had 34 releases

148
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:07,360
since last year spanning a

149
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,520
total of almost 4400 commits

150
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,880
contributed by almost a hundred

151
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,440
different contributors

152
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,000
to the core and libraries directly used

153
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,000
by the core

154
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,039
despite all the hurdles this year it

155
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,440
looks like

156
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,960
covet 19 did in the end not really

157
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,319
impact the momentum of

158
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,318
our development process

159
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,600
the improvements include a lot a long

160
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,479
list of bugs

161
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:39,280
among others also several security fixes

162
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,919
since we're building an open source tool

163
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,638
for the

164
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,560
security community we're in the lucky

165
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,919
position to get a very high number of

166
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,960
penetration tests

167
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:54,479
with their outcomes are reported to us

168
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,440
with assists we as a caesar

169
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,800
take these extremely seriously and we

170
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,039
are quite vocal

171
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,800
about anything that might lead to

172
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:06,159
security issues

173
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,599
as such we request cves for any

174
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:12,319
security issue found please make sure

175
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,199
that you keep your miss up to date and

176
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,440
if you run miss

177
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,759
follow our twitter account to receive

178
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:21,680
updates on when we have security fix

179
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:25,120
is available besides

180
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,639
fixing bugs we improved how miss behaves

181
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,840
in general

182
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,880
so expect that quite so expect quite a

183
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,880
few improvements

184
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,039
we have also spent quite a bit of time

185
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,719
this year to tune and rework the

186
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:42,080
internals to accommodate

187
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:45,840
the rapid increase in user base

188
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:48,479
and data shared in misp

189
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,479
in general

190
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:53,120
it has been quite a considerable effort

191
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,719
done by the community

192
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,199
to encode context libraries in miss

193
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,080
meaning a host of new vocabularies

194
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,000
knowledge base

195
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,080
items and data models that were encoded

196
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,039
but besides these more general

197
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,359
improvements

198
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,199
let's have a look at some of the feature

199
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,560
highlights that have dropped over their

200
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,400
past year

201
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,240
so let's have a look at some of the

202
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,280
major features and improvements since

203
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,879
last year

204
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,559
so one of the main aspects that we were

205
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,000
lacking in this was the accurate

206
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,520
timelining of the various events

207
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,280
described in lisp

208
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,039
something that the inclusion of the new

209
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,520
timeline feature that has recently been

210
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,159
merged

211
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,840
that has alleviated you can see a sample

212
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,839
of the events timeline is presented in

213
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,360
misp so each of those individual data

214
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,240
points there are either attributes or

215
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,680
objects and

216
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,360
now we can place them in time on the

217
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:41,199
timeline

218
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,120
since we put more effort these days into

219
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,720
the ioc lifecycle management part of

220
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,680
things it has become more and more

221
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,080
important for us

222
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,319
to be able to place these iocs in time

223
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,399
it also allows us to better tell story

224
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,080
about how an incident progressed so just

225
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,440
being able to

226
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,440
see the links from before between

227
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,959
objects is now also additionally

228
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,640
enriched by the timeline where you can

229
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,359
see how each of the events followed each

230
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,199
other

231
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,200
instead of just dumping our io seasonal

232
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,760
partners

233
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,680
we now have a system that allows us to

234
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,360
basically

235
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,760
deal more with the story and tell a

236
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,120
story through the shared information

237
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,800
directly

238
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,959
and this is mainly due to an increase in

239
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,240
capabilities both on the producing and

240
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,439
the consuming side

241
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:24,160
what it actually means is that

242
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:26,800
organizations that are now producing or

243
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:29,040
enriching data are more likely to

244
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,199
contextualize their data well

245
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,880
this is uh partially because the tool

246
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,480
has improved and tooling automatically

247
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,160
does this now cross when it comes for

248
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,320
example to attack

249
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,160
techniques a lot of the automatic tools

250
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,279
extract this information includes in the

251
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,560
output

252
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,920
but we have also matured in our

253
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,719
processes and what we are actually

254
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,439
looking for

255
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,640
matures organizations basically on the

256
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,399
consumption side

257
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,839
we are dealing with richer data

258
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,040
obviously because richer data is

259
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,240
produced

260
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,000
and we're also dealing with more

261
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,600
voluminous data due to the increases in

262
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,279
the sizes of the communities and the

263
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,800
sharing in general

264
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,959
so it is has become more and more

265
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,439
important to restrict our working data

266
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,000
set

267
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,160
to better sub selected set of of our

268
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,040
full data set

269
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,920
either to avoid overloading our systems

270
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,360
with

271
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:17,360
basically not that useful information

272
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,480
and also to avoid false positives in

273
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,920
general

274
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,079
timelining also has allowed us to to

275
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,519
see time-based correlations between

276
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,199
different events

277
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,040
that means that we can now determine

278
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,000
which occurrences happened at the same

279
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,680
time as certain other

280
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,440
occurrences and draw conclusions from

281
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,760
that and find potential links between

282
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,760
those things

283
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,240
another major development was the

284
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,480
outcome of mostly our personal interests

285
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,519
or rather should i say our personal

286
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,240
fears

287
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,360
um when it comes to kobe and how it was

288
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,040
evolving

289
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,560
we're simply trying to make sense of all

290
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,599
the information that we

291
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,760
uh saw online and that we received uh

292
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,800
about how the virus was spreading how it

293
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,079
affected us

294
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,680
how at the time when we were still

295
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,640
planning our travels back early in

296
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,160
february

297
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,839
how it was affecting our travel

298
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,560
engagements um

299
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,120
so to track all of this we tried to

300
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,359
modify

301
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,519
mis to make it work for us so we

302
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,640
basically stood up a special kobe 19 in

303
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,399
this community

304
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,800
which we supported by building a whole

305
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:18,560
new dashboarding system for risk

306
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,920
the idea was to make something that

307
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,719
allows us to build widgets

308
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:23,519
rapidly and allow users to basically

309
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,279
configure

310
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,760
their own dashboards directly from the

311
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,920
interface while fully making use of mis

312
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,279
internal functionalities uh along with

313
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,240
the acl system

314
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,399
and so on the kovit 19 community has

315
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,480
turned into massive success in sun

316
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,920
with large user base sharing information

317
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,959
about health

318
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,399
related aspects of the make cyber

319
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,760
security threats as well as

320
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,920
misinformation

321
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,839
threats so anything that we're facing

322
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,279
during the pandemic basically

323
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,360
if anyone's interested in joining that

324
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,680
community simply visit the url on the

325
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,160
slide and register for access

326
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,000
now obviously and the kobe 19 dashboard

327
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,959
widgets were more of a proof of concept

328
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,639
in misp

329
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,160
and since then we have a wide range of

330
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,600
other types of widgets to support

331
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,519
different use cases

332
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,639
be it from administrative widgets that

333
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:12,000
allow us to basically

334
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:15,120
suddenly check our lisp and monitor

335
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,040
the administrative tasks to sharing

336
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,360
trend widgets that basically show us

337
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,800
how active our community is how mature

338
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:23,360
the different organizations are in

339
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,680
different types of

340
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,120
contextualized data sharing and so on

341
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,839
and also gamification

342
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:31,920
that basically uh allow us to rank the

343
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,480
sharing of organizations so

344
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,920
if communities opt for having that

345
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,279
enabled then you basically have

346
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,279
achievements and so on to organization

347
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:44,079
so here you can see default dashboard of

348
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,000
the misp of the copied 19 miss vincent's

349
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,199
so when users log in and go to dashboard

350
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,880
this is what they see

351
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,639
it basically shows the trends derived

352
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,920
from the john hopkins data set

353
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,240
all of these widgets are highly

354
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,760
configurable by each user individually

355
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,440
users can create and configure

356
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,319
dashboards to their own liking and save

357
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,079
their state

358
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,079
they can also decide to share the

359
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,920
configurations with other users

360
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:05,599
of either the instance or outside of the

361
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,800
instance by exporting

362
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:12,240
json configuration documents uh

363
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,800
administrators can also choose to

364
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,639
pick a dashboard as a default of the

365
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,719
system meaning that new users logging in

366
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,120
will be automatically

367
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,959
getting the dashboard pre-configured as

368
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,920
for the development of new widgets

369
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,680
it follows a similar mantra to the

370
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,839
modules that we have in this

371
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,160
meaning that we try to make it as simple

372
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,000
and plug-and-play as possible

373
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,279
with a wide range of helpers to ease the

374
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,040
development so if you want to get

375
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,720
involved with that

376
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,639
have a look on github how the modules

377
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,040
work and let's get started with this

378
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,639
rather straightforward

379
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,880
we've also spent a fair amount of time

380
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,120
to rework our initial implementation of

381
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,800
our indicator dk system

382
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,519
so mostly to allow for more

383
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,760
customization by the individual users

384
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:57,440
we can now create user-specific rules

385
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,959
that are automatically used by their

386
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,560
individual api queries

387
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,319
meaning that we can create special

388
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,719
tooling user accounts

389
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,480
for the various different use cases that

390
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,880
all have pre-configured rule sets

391
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,639
ensuring that they all get user-specific

392
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,959
subsets of the full data set

393
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,000
so if you have a seam configured to pull

394
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,079
data from lisp

395
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,600
you can tune the rules for for that

396
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:19,839
specific user to

397
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,360
either use the indicator dk system or

398
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:23,839
other metrics to

399
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,800
define the data set we have also opened

400
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,839
up the

401
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,479
re-evaluation of taxonomy label values

402
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,000
to further refine how each vocabulary is

403
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,440
treated in the context of the indicator

404
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,480
life cycle management

405
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,560
on a more case-by-case basis this can be

406
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,000
overridden by either the administrator

407
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:42,239
globally for instance

408
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,360
or by each individual user for their own

409
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,959
liking

410
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,880
one of the key elements missing from our

411
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,040
calculation before were also the

412
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,320
sightings provided by the community

413
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,079
these are now factored into the

414
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,639
indicator scoring system

415
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,839
meaning that data reported still being

416
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:00,399
relevant

417
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,399
has its dk reset based on the settings

418
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:06,320
when an analyst inserts

419
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:08,320
information to into misp it's very

420
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:11,680
common to start with a set of

421
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:14,959
unstructured indicators

422
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:17,599
at a later stage combining attributes

423
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,040
into objects start starts making more

424
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:22,000
and more sense

425
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,319
however the efforts spend on the process

426
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,279
of

427
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,160
creating those attributes again within

428
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:28,959
objects

429
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,079
will result in analysts deciding to save

430
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:34,079
time and move on

431
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:37,279
leaving the instructor data as is

432
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:39,599
to reduce this workload needed to bring

433
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,160
structure to our prior work

434
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,519
we introduced the feature allowing users

435
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,880
to easily select

436
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,519
a set of attributes and automatically

437
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,399
propose

438
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,199
suitable object templates depending on

439
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,360
the

440
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:55,519
combination of types of the selected

441
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,199
attributes

442
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:02,480
once the template is set under proposed

443
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:05,758
change is confirmed that by the user

444
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:09,839
the selected attributes are then merged

445
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,839
into an object

446
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,560
besides misp itself we also had

447
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,079
a major rework of pi miss our python

448
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,758
library suit to support

449
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:25,040
integrations and automation in general

450
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,160
we now require python 3.6 as a bare

451
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,639
minimum

452
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,439
and all of the internals have moved to a

453
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:34,320
more object-oriented approach

454
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,120
including including a wide range of

455
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,720
helpers

456
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,519
to make your life a bit easier when

457
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,519
talking to miss

458
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:46,479
one of the other uses for

459
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:50,240
pymis for us internally is

460
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:53,680
we use we use it as part of our ci

461
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:56,959
process along with a list of tests

462
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:00,000
that we run on each commit

463
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:02,239
this has grown substantially and we have

464
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:06,400
a rather complete coverage of all

465
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:09,120
apis no via the test suit

466
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,679
also included now in the testing is the

467
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,399
setup

468
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,360
and synchronization of multiple missed

469
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,199
instances

470
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,438
so we've been able to catch more

471
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:20,480
potential potential bugs

472
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:23,439
that would otherwise have made it into

473
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,439
the main code base

474
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,640
as part of our duty to run and manage

475
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,840
communities

476
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,240
we run into several hurdles that made

477
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,760
our

478
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:38,960
own lives a bit more difficult than

479
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,360
than we like when it comes to running

480
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,559
miss

481
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,320
communities we have implemented a

482
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:47,840
community support suit

483
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:50,320
of feature features that to make it

484
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,320
easier

485
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,360
user configurations allow us as

486
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,399
administrators

487
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:01,840
and also each individual user to

488
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:05,600
manage how mess behaves for each

489
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:06,559
individually for each user individual

490
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,039
history

491
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,600
for example by configuring alerting

492
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,960
rules

493
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,959
dashboards and so on

494
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,039
we also added a community listing system

495
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,240
so communities can

496
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:23,840
opt in to be listed uh

497
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,919
here if they reach out to us

498
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,799
and they will be listed by default in

499
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:31,760
any new misp installation

500
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,200
the idea is that we now have a simple

501
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,559
process where users

502
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:41,440
can select the communities that they

503
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:44,240
think they out to have access

504
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,720
have access to and applied to them

505
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:49,120
directly from nisp

506
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,919
the owners of the communities will get

507
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,320
an alert

508
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,840
email describing all necessary

509
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:58,240
information to enroll the

510
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:02,399
registrant then would they choose to

511
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:04,720
allow them into their community

512
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:07,200
we have also improved our integrations

513
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:10,080
with authentication systems

514
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,640
and also we had an email based otp

515
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,918
system

516
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,919
contributed to miss

517
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:21,280
one of the key purpose of misp is to

518
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,000
fit our user's workflow by supporting

519
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,320
the tools

520
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,080
and format the use internally to their

521
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,320
daily work

522
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,480
we've been working with vendors to make

523
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,360
sure that their subscribers

524
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,799
have easy access to their services

525
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,520
through misp

526
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,160
with the list of integrations rapidly

527
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:41,918
growing

528
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,720
over the past year in addition to

529
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:46,080
integrating

530
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:49,120
with specific tools we've also been

531
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:52,080
working on our various integrations

532
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,159
targeting other exchange formats

533
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:57,760
including a comprehensive rewrite

534
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,760
of our sticks to integration

535
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,679
we have quite a few users of multiga

536
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,879
already that were basically using

537
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,240
the integration forms before and thanks

538
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,559
to christoph on the bus

539
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,919
this has now been greatly reworked and

540
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,280
is now available by an official

541
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,880
transforming multigo

542
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,480
so you can use miss as an additional

543
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,520
transform back-end for your work in

544
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,200
multi-go

545
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,960
we also drive the development of a set

546
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,960
of other open source tools in hauseit

547
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,240
circle which have received the title

548
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,039
integration with miss

549
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:25,760
so this includes scale our analysis into

550
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,120
inform

551
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,280
mission leaks framework uh as well as d4

552
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,039
which is our open source sensor network

553
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,039
so if you're interested in any of those

554
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,720
projects have a look at our github pages

555
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,679
everything is open source that we do and

556
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,320
available

557
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:42,640
and they're all now tightly integrated a

558
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,240
long list of new galaxies taxonomies

559
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,000
and object templates so basically our

560
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,080
context libraries have also been

561
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,400
contributed by various partners

562
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,840
and various parties and one of the most

563
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,960
interesting new developments we've seen

564
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:56,639
over the

565
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,679
past year we're basically riding on the

566
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,880
massive success

567
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:04,240
of the attack framework from mitre

568
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:07,679
and we have basically seen a long list

569
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:11,919
of attack-like matrixes being encoded as

570
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:14,159
smith galaxies and added to the system

571
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:16,400
this means that the ideas and the

572
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,720
representation of the framework

573
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,440
have been mapped to other domains for

574
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,919
example

575
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:23,520
in the domain of disinformation by amit

576
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:26,159
financial fraud

577
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,799
election interference gsm related

578
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:29,520
attacks

579
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,400
and several others so i highly encourage

580
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,360
everyone that is

581
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,440
thinking of mapping something um a

582
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,120
framework of contextualizing information

583
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,679
that includes a kill chain element as

584
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:41,199
well as

585
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:45,840
different techniques and to think about

586
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,840
reusing the methodology of attack

587
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:53,600
with miss we have a module system

588
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,200
providing autonomous python modules that

589
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,320
can be used to either

590
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:01,679
extend data that is already missed or

591
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,360
populate your events with some data to

592
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,360
import

593
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,959
those modules have always been very

594
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,760
lightweight pieces of code

595
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,640
handling simple queries and returning

596
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,760
single

597
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,840
mis attributes to add to an existing

598
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,080
event

599
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,600
at some point we realized the simple

600
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,240
input and output model

601
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:23,760
we used since the beginning of the miss

602
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,320
modules

603
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,360
would be blocking us in parsing some

604
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,799
more complex

605
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:34,158
queries so we recently

606
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:37,918
introduced a new type of modules called

607
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:41,039
mis format modules that are able to run

608
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,600
to return the full spectrum of data and

609
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,640
its

610
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:47,678
respective contextualization that mis

611
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:51,120
supports while maintaining

612
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:53,679
backwards com compatibility by

613
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,399
supporting the old format additionally

614
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:58,159
this

615
00:22:54,400 --> 00:23:00,480
allows us to not only capture indicators

616
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:03,200
but also the context provided by the

617
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:06,840
external services

618
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,240
let's see the advantage of mis format

619
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:11,120
modules

620
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,120
with an example

621
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:16,320
the text attribute shown under the cv

622
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:19,200
value

623
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:22,240
in this screenshot shows the output of

624
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,600
the old cv expansion module which is a

625
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:26,799
single flap

626
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,559
attribute with a description the new

627
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:32,000
module returns

628
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:35,440
a complex object with additional details

629
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:38,880
such as references a cvss

630
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:42,400
score and other data points which

631
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:45,919
extracted additional besides this

632
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:49,039
modules could also include labels

633
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:52,799
and inter-object relationships

634
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,799
whenever they would make sense

635
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:57,120
now let's have a look at what we have

636
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,039
planned for the future

637
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,199
and keep in mind that nothing is set in

638
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,760
stone besides what is

639
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,240
basically just around the corner so for

640
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:09,840
some of the long-term features

641
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:12,799
features priorities things

642
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:12,799
might shift around

643
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:19,520
we've talked about our improvements to

644
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:22,159
the miss module system already

645
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,720
but despite there being a shift in the

646
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,919
right

647
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,080
direction we're not happy with them just

648
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,640
yet

649
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,480
expansion modules are currently limited

650
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,919
to expanding individual

651
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:39,760
data points we want uh we want to

652
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:42,799
to expand this to take into account

653
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:45,360
its context in this terms

654
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,320
this means that we'd like to introduce

655
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,199
the expansion

656
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,360
of entire events as opposed to single

657
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,760
attributes

658
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,479
we also want to expand our import

659
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,799
modules

660
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,000
to be able to create entire

661
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:01,360
contextualized

662
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:05,919
events or collections of events rather

663
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:10,000
than just lists of individual indicators

664
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:13,200
another hurdle we need to overcome are

665
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,080
long-lasting enrichment processes think

666
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:17,200
of submitting

667
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,158
a sample to a sandbox and retrieving the

668
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,720
results

669
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,000
for example for this to be more

670
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,600
convenient

671
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,880
in the future we plan on providing

672
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,678
support for the deferred execution

673
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:34,159
modules

674
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,159
via a message messaging system

675
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,840
we also want to simplify the obligatory

676
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:41,120
user interaction

677
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,600
for dealing with module output

678
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,120
currently users need to confirm the

679
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,840
results before they

680
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,239
they are stored we want to make this

681
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,799
step

682
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,360
optional for modules where the results

683
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,559
are more

684
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,000
selfied self-evident of course dealing

685
00:25:54,559 --> 00:26:00,158
with uncertain results

686
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,919
make this in many cases tricky

687
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,640
one of the features that we've had in

688
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:07,279
our roadmap for now almost half a decade

689
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,360
is in the final stages finally so and

690
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,840
almost ready to emerge

691
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,840
for example

692
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:16,320
this includes the sharing of custom

693
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,640
galaxies

694
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,360
meaning that the knowledge-based

695
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,279
libraries that

696
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:23,039
have been missed on all sorts of topics

697
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,400
such as threat actor information

698
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:28,400
attacker techniques

699
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:30,880
and even attack from from nitro

700
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,600
are basically encoded in this system and

701
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,159
these will be

702
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,279
opened up to sharing and modifications

703
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,919
so you'll be able to create

704
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:39,279
modify and fork and share your own

705
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,039
galaxy clusters

706
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,559
so that your community may use those to

707
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,240
contextualize the data

708
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,000
the distribution system will be

709
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:49,279
similarly granular to what is used

710
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,679
elsewhere so

711
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,400
this means that you will be able to keep

712
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,640
ownership

713
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,159
of the modified and newly created

714
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,000
galaxies the same way as you would with

715
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,360
events for example

716
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,360
another major improvement for the

717
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,479
galaxies is being able to relate them to

718
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,240
one another

719
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,000
this allows us to also tell a better

720
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:08,080
story basically with our data

721
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,120
for example being able to attribute data

722
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,279
to a threat factor

723
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,439
that is known to target a certain sector

724
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:15,840
and having a suspected motivation

725
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,600
are now possible with this new system

726
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,918
the feature is already beaten

727
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,158
and available so it is already being

728
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:24,960
tested by a set of organizations

729
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:25,520
and this is last call basically to have

730
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,760
your say

731
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:29,679
so if you want to influence how the

732
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,960
system will finally work in bisp

733
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:34,720
now is a good time to to basically

734
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,000
get started with it and give us a sanity

735
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:41,120
check before we actually merge it

736
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,679
so besides having uh and sharing

737
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:45,120
structured data which is really great

738
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:47,279
for automation

739
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,039
one of our annoyances with miss was that

740
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:51,600
we had a hard time expressing

741
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,480
just plain text information along with

742
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,918
the data

743
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:55,840
so we're changing this by including the

744
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,000
report feature

745
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:00,399
that allows us to basically tell our

746
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:02,000
story in a more unstructured form

747
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,840
what we're going to be using are marked

748
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,480
on reports that will travel along with

749
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,158
the events

750
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,640
and be treated as part of the package

751
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:12,320
so when we started out with nisp we were

752
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,279
basically dealing with a very

753
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,960
tiny set of communities and a tiny set

754
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,799
of organizations in our individual

755
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:21,520
communities

756
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:23,120
so basically from a community management

757
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,399
aspect the exchange was rather

758
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,678
lightweight

759
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,520
this has changed over the years

760
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,360
drastically we nowadays

761
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,879
have massive communities with deeply

762
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,879
branching networks

763
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,360
means it's become difficult to have

764
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,840
oversight over the different communities

765
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,080
and efficiently exchange for example

766
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:43,760
information on organizational

767
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:45,120
metadata to build your trust in your

768
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,640
community

769
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,320
we have another open source project in

770
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,039
the making which we hope will change

771
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:50,799
this

772
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,240
the tool is called cerebrate and is part

773
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,600
of an eu funded project called

774
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,840
melecertis

775
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,199
the goal is to have trusted cerebral

776
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,639
nodes run by

777
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:00,559
central authorities of the various

778
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,360
different communities providing a

779
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:05,039
trusted library of the organizations

780
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:07,678
the various different distributions such

781
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:09,039
hearing groups as well as encryption

782
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,279
keys

783
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,039
for their various different communities

784
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:15,200
so we also want to make

785
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:17,200
this tool instrument and easy

786
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,799
interconnectivity between organizations

787
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,039
so if you want to set up

788
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,799
connectivity to members of your isaf for

789
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,240
example this tool will help you

790
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,399
instrument that

791
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,240
as for the key exchange part it's part

792
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,918
of the ongoing development in miss

793
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,520
so those of you that are following the

794
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:33,120
project closely have probably seen some

795
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,360
traces of this already

796
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,639
and we want to basically provide data

797
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,799
signing and data and

798
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:40,240
the validation of the signatures of data

799
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,158
within your communities

800
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,919
an early alpha version of the two is

801
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,960
already available on github so everyone

802
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:48,720
can get involved in the development

803
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,080
we're also planning on moving misp to a

804
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:52,080
more modern stack

805
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:54,480
leaving behind by now rather dated

806
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:55,840
framework desktop that we're on

807
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,240
uh server at the tool mentioned just

808
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,480
before acts as a testbed for us

809
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,480
so it shares a lot of the internals with

810
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,360
this and we use it to gradually all

811
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,559
support

812
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:08,080
uh subsystems and components of mis over

813
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:11,039
to the new stack

814
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:12,399
so the the two projects will start

815
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,720
sharing one more code and

816
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,479
more of the code will be unified into

817
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,240
something similar so that we can port it

818
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,080
over once we're ready to move to the new

819
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,320
stack

820
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:24,080
so to sum it all up there are a lot of

821
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,678
exciting things happening

822
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,080
and as you can see we're chasing down

823
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:30,000
quite a few different paths of the of uh

824
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:32,320
development and improvements from us

825
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:33,760
but sadly we're injured by days only

826
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,879
having 24 hours

827
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,039
so if you want to help us there are a

828
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,799
lot of ways to get involved be it from

829
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,960
sanity checking what we do

830
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,559
helping us with the development directly

831
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,320
if you have development capabilities

832
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,520
that you could divert or by supporting

833
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,080
us financially

834
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:49,279
so just reach out to us privatization is

835
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:51,199
super hard

836
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:53,039
so one of the most simple but also

837
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,880
helpful ways to support us

838
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:56,240
is to let us know what you think we

839
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,960
should focus on

840
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,960
we rely on such community feedback to

841
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,360
hopefully make better decisions

842
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,159
so this is pretty much it for us if you

843
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,760
have any questions

844
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,720
or just want to get in touch with us

845
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:10,480
here are some of our availabilities

846
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,399
so thank you for tuning in and if you

847
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,799
have any questions uh we're around

848
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:16,000
so just ask away and we'll try to answer

849
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:19,519
them the best we can

850
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:23,360
thank you all here we go we have andrus

851
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:25,519
so i'm just just i guess um

852
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,879
just reading from the q a tab there's uh

853
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,799
my first question was

854
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:33,840
how is this product different better

855
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:33,840
than mitre's attack framework

856
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,320
oops to quickly answer that yeah

857
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:39,600
basically so uh mitra attack framework

858
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,399
is a framework that we also use to

859
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:44,000
contextualize

860
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:44,799
data but misp itself is more like a tip

861
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,200
so

862
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:48,799
so basically it's the tool itself that

863
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,519
allows you to create a data that you

864
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,320
would also

865
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:55,120
place within the attack framework so i

866
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,120
hope that answers it

867
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,240
now the question was is there an

868
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,679
integration for splunk that you would

869
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,080
recommend

870
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,600
yeah and uh so in the splunk app store

871
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:09,120
there is a tool called miss

872
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,719
42 splunk so i i think that's the

873
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,760
most complete integration that we have

874
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,519
out there so it should be in the

875
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:17,440
official splunk app store

876
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:17,440
so just grab that and you're good to go

877
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,760
and uh alan has a question on where can

878
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,679
i find more details on cerebrate

879
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,879
that's a good question i didn't put the

880
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:30,320
url in there so

881
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,679
the url is um or actually if you just go

882
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,320
to github

883
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,799
you there is an organization called

884
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,158
server

885
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:41,039
project so service dash project so

886
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,440
just go there and you will find the

887
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:46,158
first version

888
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,559
that was released like months ago and

889
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:50,240
it's

890
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:51,918
early alpha so really early days but

891
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,600
development's ongoing so if you have any

892
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,720
ideas or

893
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:59,360
or basically feedback on that would be

894
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,320
