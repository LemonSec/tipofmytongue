1
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,240
good morning

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,080
thank you for joining me in this uh

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,320
oscar presentation

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,000
i i need to record this in a stage four

5
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,840
luck town in melbourne but i hope you

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
enjoy the weather in queensland

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,160
i will talk about purple team exercises

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,600
with you today

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:23,439
but my name is fatih zavja and i

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,439
work for cyber security more than two

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,480
decades and i focus on adversary

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,519
stimulation then

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,159
trade crowd research for last five years

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,000
i study also master of cyber security in

15
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:35,519
university of new south wales

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,200
i have released some vulnerabilities for

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,280
major vendors also

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,960
published them in major security

19
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,879
conferences in

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,280
black at usa devcon and other

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:49,039
today i will talk about trade actors and

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,800
uh what is purple team first

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:52,480
and then i will explain the adversary

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,800
simulation types and

25
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,239
the stages of purple team exercises how

26
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,800
we designed them

27
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:59,680
how we developed that and of course

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,199
running

29
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:05,199
and as well as getting the benefits

30
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,600
first of all the trade actors trade

31
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,640
actors have different motives

32
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,600
some try to steal some data for cyberis

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,080
funerals

34
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:19,199
but also try to get more

35
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,439
state level uh benefits such as

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,600
um targeting the uh critical

37
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,720
infrastructure

38
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,798
on the other hand there are some

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,200
ransomware ganks try to

40
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,320
compromise a certain organization

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,280
encrypt the data

42
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,639
or try to steal the data and start an

43
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,880
extortion

44
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,880
they have different motives and this may

45
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,880
reflect to their campaigns

46
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,920
ransomware attacks need only a short

47
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:44,798
term such as

48
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,560
a one week to uh one month but they

49
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,759
sponsor the tax targeting critical

50
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,439
infrastructure

51
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,960
or a financial attack targeting the

52
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:54,559
severity environment will take

53
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:57,919
up to six months or maybe a year

54
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,479
adversary simulations are the only two

55
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,759
helping organizations to understand the

56
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,320
trade actors

57
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:07,200
because other tools are defensive tools

58
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:10,160
they try to defend the parameter

59
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,840
advisory simulations help organizations

60
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,799
to understand the trade actors and

61
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,520
stimulate

62
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,080
those behaviors to understand and assess

63
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,120
their

64
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,239
investments parameter controls red team

65
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,640
is one of those

66
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,400
red team is trade intelligence based

67
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:27,040
cyber attack simulation

68
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,080
and generally one-to-one map of the

69
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,400
threat actor

70
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,319
and sometimes also encouraged by the

71
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,239
regulations such as seabest quarry or

72
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,000
icast exercises

73
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,280
there are also some commercial or open

74
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,800
source solutions

75
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,400
for automated advisory simulations

76
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,080
and they are actually using the

77
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,519
microattack map

78
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,040
to utilize their techniques in a certain

79
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,560
software

80
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,560
we will focus on the purple team

81
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,599
exercises today it is a mix of

82
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,959
both but also including the blue themes

83
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,720
or more beneficial scenarios

84
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,720
first of all we need to understand what

85
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,640
exactly we try to simulate

86
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,319
the first one is the tractor that is

87
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,238
correct but is there any other

88
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,958
regulation requirements

89
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,840
if so what are they maybe multiple trade

90
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,159
actors should

91
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,720
run at the same time or we need to focus

92
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,959
on some security breach we experienced

93
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,720
or we need to focus on the external red

94
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,800
team exercise we received

95
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,599
so we need to understand why we exactly

96
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:27,760
do this then we can just tailor fit this

97
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,720
cut some corners and we can just work on

98
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,959
it

99
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,879
some trade actors also target

100
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,680
organizations in uh real life

101
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,760
and they do this day by day if the

102
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,239
organization is under attack

103
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,399
by some certain trade actors the purple

104
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,840
team can focus on those three actors and

105
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,519
their behaviors

106
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,280
based on trade intelligence data of

107
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,560
course some ransomware gangs

108
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,560
or long-term access

109
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,559
mitral attack is a common language for

110
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,599
all these communications

111
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,040
and that's why probably you are not

112
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,839
comfortable to see this

113
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,280
map every time someone shows you but

114
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,040
this is the common language

115
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,120
and this is what we will use in this

116
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,359
presentation as well

117
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,040
some essential decisions must be taken

118
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,200
before designing this

119
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,079
purple team exercise you need to

120
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,079
understand

121
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,759
which one is beneficial informing the

122
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,880
blue teams or not

123
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,800
some exercises must be informed to get

124
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,600
more participation collaboration and

125
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,440
benefits

126
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,280
but sometimes you may need to see the

127
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,960
blue team in their real life

128
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,679
their nature actually

129
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,159
there's also some external offensive

130
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,800
teams

131
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,360
are forming this type of exercises they

132
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,199
have

133
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,840
a really good coverage however they may

134
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,520
not understand the organizational needs

135
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,560
or the resources

136
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,599
servers or controls implemented in an

137
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,600
organization

138
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,520
that's why large organizations should

139
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,479
also utilize their internal offensive

140
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,080
teams to run the purple team exercises

141
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:57,758
and there are different types of purple

142
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,080
team exercises the first one is the

143
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,759
scenario automation

144
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,080
in this exercise a certain scenario runs

145
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,120
for a short time to understand the

146
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,440
controls

147
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,880
there's also capture the flag which is a

148
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,320
sort of race

149
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,960
so red team vs blue team race

150
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,759
they try to capture more flags if

151
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,440
attacks

152
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:24,880
or actions are not detected it comes to

153
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,280
red or if detected or prevented

154
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,639
bluetooth wins that's the thing however

155
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,559
there are also capture the flag

156
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,520
exercises to understand the capability

157
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,680
requirements

158
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,599
but also allowing the other blue team

159
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,280
members to run for it such as threat

160
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,199
intelligence cyber response

161
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,400
detections and orchestration teams and

162
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,320
more

163
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,599
assume rich scenario on the other hand

164
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,639
is slightly different

165
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,800
it is a certain trade actor scenario

166
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,720
but it comes with an assumption what if

167
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,600
the trade actor has access to our class

168
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,479
service

169
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,400
what if the trade actor also has user

170
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,960
credentials and laptop

171
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,880
and the question is what's next the

172
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:05,120
exercise is designed on bet

173
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,120
designed on this declare question

174
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,800
teams can be constructed using multiple

175
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,440
teams in the organization such as blue

176
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
team

177
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,639
would have members from trade

178
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,639
intelligence cyber response security

179
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:19,039
awareness or operation teams

180
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,800
on the other hand rate team may have red

181
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,719
team of asset security or penetration

182
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,080
testing numbers because different skills

183
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,800
will be required

184
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,280
but you need to also change these teams

185
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,880
or just use members in crows teams to

186
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,679
train them better in

187
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,280
in a purple team exercise we need a lot

188
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,039
of things that include

189
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,119
some technical requirements as well as

190
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,039
business but we need to understand do we

191
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,000
need the thread intelligence data

192
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,960
if so what trade actors would be

193
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,960
stimulated

194
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,799
there may be some multiple simulations

195
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,280
that is one certain trait actor

196
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,199
uh one trajectory for ransomware and a

197
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,198
custom trade actor to understand our

198
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,280
controls better

199
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,840
it really up it's really up to the

200
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,000
organization's

201
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,560
needs technical requirements are simply

202
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,080
the accounts credentials servers but

203
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,080
business requirements are more like

204
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,120
safeguards they are change requests

205
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,719
approvals or resource allocations

206
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,880
this help us to understand the

207
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,840
organization better as well as making

208
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:22,639
this beneficial for everyone

209
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,599
in a racing bear scenario we need to

210
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:26,400
focus on

211
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,199
a few stages to get more benefits for

212
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,919
example

213
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,720
users can be targeted using phishing

214
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:33,280
attempts

215
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,039
but phishing campaigns are not only

216
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,359
phishing campaigns they actually

217
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,120
assist the security controls implemented

218
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,400
for mail gateways

219
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,080
or attachments or maybe domains

220
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,440
or something like that we have some

221
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,120
additional controls there

222
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,400
sufficient campaigns actually target

223
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,039
those security controls they are

224
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,120
understanding

225
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,240
email to test the user of course

226
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,960
security awareness

227
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,360
and user awareness is something good uh

228
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,599
and

229
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,520
it is there but we are not only

230
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:02,080
targeting that one

231
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,159
if the spear phishing is link based

232
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,520
proxy controls are also tested such as

233
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:09,280
downloading a certain

234
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:12,639
uh certain file or

235
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,400
visiting a certain domain are also there

236
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,720
as a threat and we need to understand

237
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,359
our proxy controls as well as our secure

238
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,400
internet

239
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,560
use when a user

240
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,919
gets compromised we have the endpoint

241
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,199
laptop or

242
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,479
system that means we can also test other

243
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:32,159
components such as

244
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:33,919
in our edrs our vulnerability and patch

245
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,399
management protocols and

246
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,240
controls implemented and in addition we

247
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,880
have command and control

248
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,640
system is here and we can't see that

249
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,919
that control works or not

250
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,839
because command and control

251
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,959
implementation is required to drive the

252
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,760
implant

253
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,680
installed on the client and if there is

254
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,560
no sufficient detection here

255
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,519
it's also passing through in end point

256
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,680
activities we

257
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,760
simply perform initial compromise

258
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,880
defense evasion situational awareness

259
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,279
privilege escalation

260
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,959
exploiting some certain vulnerabilities

261
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,800
all those controls are simply

262
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:11,119
tested and after that we simply

263
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,319
start encryption before that of course

264
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,959
we need to stop

265
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,240
the backup protocols volume shadow copy

266
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,719
and something like that

267
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,680
now we need to remove all those backups

268
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,680
and copies

269
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,800
then start encrypting the data then

270
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,279
leave a message

271
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,640
this would also test the cyber response

272
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,720
as well as the data backups procedure

273
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,720
if we change the scenario to the supply

274
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,000
chain supply chain

275
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,959
attacks would have an implication on

276
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,160
our initial compromise for example the

277
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,160
supply chain attacks

278
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,839
start with hardware additions compromise

279
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,959
server compromise laptop

280
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,120
a usb device compromised or something

281
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:52,399
like that or a software

282
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:55,680
uh compromise such as a docker software

283
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,519
a certain docker container or a certain

284
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,279
desktop software compromised

285
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,959
because of the vendor this type of

286
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,279
scenarios can be also

287
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,959
implemented and they actually test our

288
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,600
other security controls such as physical

289
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,920
access

290
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,600
software and inventory management or

291
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,120
hardware monitoring for the malicious

292
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,279
devices

293
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,160
endpoint assessments are slightly

294
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:16,800
similar so

295
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,240
we can exactly see that they are almost

296
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,599
same with the ransomware

297
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,760
but we need to also perform a simple

298
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,800
lateral movement for the server side

299
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,680
access

300
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,680
the lateral movement section also starts

301
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,319
additional attacks such as

302
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,880
reusing the credentials running some

303
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:37,519
code through wmi psx deck or

304
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,320
powershell services or remote services

305
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,480
as well

306
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:42,640
and after that exfoliating some data

307
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,279
with dlp flags

308
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,720
in this case fiber response as well as

309
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,839
some lateral movement direction

310
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,560
will be tested but data exfiltration

311
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,000
with dlp flags would also test data

312
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,839
protection services

313
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,040
so we can see that they are efficient or

314
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,279
not

315
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,519
if we go to the assembly scenario we can

316
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:04,000
start a certain point

317
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,959
and that certain point will be cloud or

318
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,440
end point

319
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,719
in this example this endpoint to make

320
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:10,959
this slightly simple

321
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,920
but you can start uh from a cloud

322
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,399
service as well

323
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,279
a compromised docker container and let's

324
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,760
move on there

325
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,959
escape from docker electric privileges

326
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,880
uh and then

327
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,479
working on kubernetes and compromising

328
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,200
cloud and establishing

329
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,240
a kind of uh pivot home uh to the

330
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,279
organization

331
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,000
that's really great implementation but

332
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,600
also

333
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:35,920
if endpoint and server scenario is valid

334
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,360
we can still test the lateral movement

335
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,160
features

336
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,079
whenever we land to the servers we have

337
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:44,000
also some actions on objectives

338
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,239
because most of the trade actors also

339
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,360
chase some sort of

340
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:52,160
benefits such as financial gain or

341
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,760
maybe as a certain data for cyber

342
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,279
espionage

343
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,360
in this example we focus on the

344
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,760
financial data that's why we focus on

345
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,399
some

346
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,760
servers responsible of financial

347
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,519
operations

348
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,680
this helps us to understand the

349
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,079
financial controls or fraud controls

350
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,760
about during the exercise some data

351
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,359
manipulation fraud attempts

352
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,519
creating a transfer or approving

353
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,000
transfer would help us to understand

354
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:16,639
if a trade actor generates a certain

355
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
transfer

356
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:23,200
or approves it what control would work

357
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,120
and try to avoid it

358
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,959
scenario automation is also possible

359
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,079
since 2016 there are

360
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:32,079
automated adversary emulations

361
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,439
research in the world mantra is the

362
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,359
leader here and i

363
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,360
added some uh papers in this

364
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:40,480
presentation uh references

365
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:42,800
so four different papers from mitra and

366
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,680
two independent researchers are attached

367
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,599
to this uh

368
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,880
presentation if you are interested in

369
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,279
because automation

370
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,320
would have different uh implementations

371
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,560
and they have

372
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,440
actually some consequences as well you

373
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,839
may not cover

374
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:59,040
uh the trade actor efficiently but it is

375
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:01,040
slightly easier to implement

376
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,319
mitral attack can be implemented but you

377
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,959
need to understand

378
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,760
what techniques are used by those trade

379
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:08,079
actors

380
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,040
that's why micro attack navigator tool

381
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,439
helps you

382
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:13,920
to understand what techniques are used

383
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:17,040
by those trade actors

384
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:19,680
so you can use this tool to understand

385
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,160
what techniques must be in scope for

386
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:24,880
your purple team exercise

387
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,279
when the platform stage comes you need

388
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,800
to

389
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:31,519
understand your environment

390
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,279
and then you need to understand which

391
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,279
type of deployment

392
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:36,480
is suitable to your environment it is

393
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,600
mostly cloud but

394
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,320
of course the the provider

395
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,560
is a kind of decision uh point for you

396
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,519
if you are testing office 365 you may

397
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,479
need to go

398
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:49,839
a kind of office 365 tenancy or if you

399
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:53,279
are focusing on only

400
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,839
organization from um over internet only

401
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,279
and you can use azure or digital motion

402
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,519
easily

403
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,639
what you'll what you will do is simply

404
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,360
installing the

405
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,120
servers on a cloud service but also

406
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,839
protecting them

407
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:10,000
making them look legitimate that's why

408
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:12,959
the domain fronting will be used

409
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,959
additional aged or expired domains can

410
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,040
be registered for this exercise

411
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,800
you can classify the domains to make

412
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,599
this environment legitimate

413
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,359
at least it should look legitimate

414
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,120
operational security is also important

415
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,800
for you to protect this environment

416
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,160
because we will use this for this

417
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,760
production exercise

418
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,279
real-time monitoring encrypting

419
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,920
everything and of course implementing

420
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,920
some compliance requirements

421
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,000
command and control is uh the key

422
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,959
software here because we will derive

423
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:43,279
the implants on the organization using

424
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,839
the command and control services

425
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:47,680
if we simulate a certain trade actor we

426
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,519
can align our command and control

427
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,199
selection with that thread actor

428
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,959
otherwise we need to focus on our

429
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,839
objectives if we need

430
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:57,518
long-term objectives to complete we can

431
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,320
focus on long-term access

432
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,519
features such as keeping the c2 alive

433
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:05,519
for four months

434
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:08,320
and are using a kind of uh low beaconing

435
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,440
one beacon per day just checking that it

436
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,440
is running or not

437
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,440
but interactive weakening will require

438
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,480
real-time communication such as

439
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,279
taking screenshots using vnc or remote

440
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,839
desktop

441
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,040
we need to install multiple cto's for

442
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,440
these purposes

443
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,680
and choosing the right c2 is important

444
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,519
sometimes protocols sometimes

445
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,560
being cloud native would be decision

446
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:33,279
point silver c2 choices for us

447
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,319
are kavos strike covenant and silent

448
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,720
trinity

449
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,480
kobas rack is also used by trail actors

450
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,040
so it's a kind of common

451
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,759
tool but covenant and silent trinity

452
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,399
also give

453
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,839
us additional options such as using that

454
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,079
nature crate craft

455
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,880
and making everything slightly uh

456
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,638
cutting edge

457
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,560
and working on everything slightly

458
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,880
flexible

459
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,680
if you have concerns about selection and

460
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,240
you think that

461
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,719
some of those features are not suitable

462
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,360
to you

463
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,079
you can always visit c2 matrix project

464
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,800
to

465
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,439
understand what ctus are available in

466
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,880
the file

467
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,959
and which one is more suitable to you

468
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,320
scenario automation also requires

469
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:14,479
additional c2s

470
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,759
i will not explain all the tests but

471
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,199
mitra caldera is

472
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:21,600
one of those automating the scenarios

473
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,920
for you using open source solutions

474
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,120
and tdps are there but customization is

475
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:28,560
slightly difficult

476
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:30,480
red canary has a poc level

477
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,399
uh implementations techniques are

478
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:34,560
implemented individually

479
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,560
and you can combine color and atomic ray

480
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,719
team at the same time and running

481
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,680
a great team examples one by one and

482
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,320
together in

483
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:46,800
automation way attack is

484
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,079
a purple team command and control server

485
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:53,120
i developed this for a certain reason

486
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:56,239
which is i need to add my custom code to

487
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,480
a certain a reliable application because

488
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,240
cobastrac has been acquired recently or

489
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,279
commercial decisions may change and

490
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,959
product and may get discontinued and my

491
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,439
code would be discontinued if that's the

492
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,600
case

493
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:08,640
to avoid this kind of challenge i prefer

494
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,678
to use my

495
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,000
uh own code set and adding some features

496
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,240
to

497
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,439
that command and control server that was

498
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,640
the idea behind of

499
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,559
attack cpu attack supports interactive

500
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,360
uh communications such as web circuit

501
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,000
communication

502
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,119
but also nested implant approach uh and

503
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,039
create a star map

504
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:30,239
in the target organization using

505
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:33,039
assembly name pipes tcp or udp protocols

506
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,720
this supports um supports.net

507
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:38,000
assemblies.net source code

508
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:39,679
uh or just normal process execution

509
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,600
uh powershell through system management

510
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,039
automation in.net and it's

511
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,959
a normal shell code as well they're

512
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,799
using different techniques to inject

513
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,720
and it supports also lateral movement

514
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,440
that means it has a really good coverage

515
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,720
for

516
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:56,320
red and purple team simulations

517
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,880
it also supports scenario-based ttp

518
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:59,200
approach

519
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,240
and this feature added recently at

520
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,559
website

521
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,679
has some examples and today i will also

522
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,600
show you briefly

523
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:09,440
how it works software

524
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,439
is not limited with the command and

525
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:14,080
control there are some additional

526
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,640
software sheets or tools you need to use

527
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,480
such as

528
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,840
fishing environment using goldfish or

529
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,400
maybe evil jinx

530
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,720
as a kind of proxy or fishing management

531
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,440
environment to understand how it works

532
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,600
and then collecting all these statistics

533
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,440
and share with the teams

534
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,280
initial access privilege escalation

535
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:32,400
evasion awareness they also need

536
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,960
additional tools

537
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:37,200
some of those are slightly old but they

538
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,679
are still useful unicorn sharp shooter

539
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,039
or ghost pack can be used for this kind

540
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,160
of activities

541
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:47,120
ad is another one active directory tools

542
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,400
would be also necessary for some certain

543
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,760
exercise types

544
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,679
pink castle will discover the

545
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,760
vulnerabilities plot fund will

546
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,440
reveal the infrastructure issues and

547
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,280
reviews and kqao will help you to

548
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:59,120
perform kerberos effects

549
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,960
for lateral moment perspective you can

550
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,678
use multiple protocols and there are

551
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,480
some tools

552
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:04,960
to perform this easily as well and you

553
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:10,400
can use

554
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:13,360
native class services

555
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,480
security is also quite important because

556
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,959
the operation

557
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,240
itself must be secure you exfiltrate

558
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,200
some data you share your

559
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,640
own code and this code can be submitted

560
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,000
to virustotal

561
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,480
this kind of activities should be

562
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,919
monitored red elk is a response to this

563
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,240
type of activities

564
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,400
it's an open source application it

565
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:35,840
simply collects the c2 logs

566
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,799
proxy logs or iocs and it also monitors

567
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,559
these iocs

568
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,840
in different commercial or open source

569
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,639
fields so

570
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:44,720
simply if you start an implant and blue

571
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,240
team members upload this to virustotal

572
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,919
to check the implant

573
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:50,640
you can see this and you can say that

574
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,720
okay buluchim has taken this action

575
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,559
or if blue team tries to test your

576
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,720
implant in a certain sandbox you can

577
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,760
also monitor this activity as well

578
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:02,559
it gives you more blue team uh telemetry

579
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,320
as well as uh understand the unwanted

580
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:06,399
victims or

581
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,559
potential security breach in this

582
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,480
environment

583
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:11,840
planting flags also help you to

584
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:14,799
understand the

585
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,439
individual team capabilities so the

586
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:20,559
individuals that is reverse engineers or

587
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:21,679
network specialists can be tested using

588
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,840
the flags

589
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,679
and you can assign those flags to

590
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,520
certain groups or certain people to

591
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,440
understand that

592
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:34,320
do they have that capability if so how

593
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:37,120
for example initiating the malware and

594
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,879
deploying it using multiple stages

595
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,719
executing the command it could be a

596
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,200
powershell command as a

597
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,240
flag and a dropper for example a kind of

598
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,880
uh dotnet

599
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,520
application and this can be disassembled

600
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,640
easily

601
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,200
uh using the the compiler for that net

602
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,799
and slack can be in the source code and

603
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,799
that net application can invoke a

604
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,840
certain shell code for example the first

605
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:01,039
stage of

606
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:02,959
call bus right and that shellcode

607
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:05,280
will be downloaded and that charcoal may

608
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,280
have a flag and the second stage will

609
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,720
have a different flag

610
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:11,200
so you can test the power shell

611
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,039
including decoding capabilities or

612
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,640
net reverse engine capabilities or

613
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,600
native shell code or binary reverse

614
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:20,000
engine

615
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:22,719
is there so you can flag everything

616
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,720
which will be useful for your individual

617
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,559
capability assessment

618
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,200
but you need to also monitor this using

619
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:32,399
capture the flag monitoring system

620
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,120
the exercise should uh run under some

621
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,799
certain

622
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:39,199
rules as well of course the scenario

623
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,559
will be done in one or two minutes maybe

624
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,720
even an hour

625
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,678
but blue team will not see this in that

626
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,080
time manner

627
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,039
they will see this with some delay maybe

628
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,399
a day or

629
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,320
if you are so you need to give that

630
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,120
grace period to them

631
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,280
so uh if you split the scenario for

632
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,320
example initial compromise and endpoint

633
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,320
activities and

634
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,840
latino movement activities and actions

635
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,760
on objective activities

636
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:03,120
you can perform this exercise in three

637
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,440
days performing

638
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,479
all the attacks in morning and allowing

639
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,039
the balloon team to get

640
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,159
elementary for the rest of the day that

641
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,480
would be an approach

642
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,200
there must be an orchestrator as well as

643
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,880
a manager

644
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,200
assigned to these activities to

645
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:21,280
understand what teams do

646
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,000
what moreover this orchestrator should

647
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,360
start

648
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,760
a kind of real-time communication

649
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,280
between the teams and monitor

650
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,879
their behaviors and construct the

651
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,559
feedback to each other as well

652
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,480
this is a friendly competition and

653
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:35,440
everybody is trying to raise the bar

654
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,320
uh against a trade actor but it is of

655
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,760
course uh

656
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,280
a kind of uh real-life activity so the

657
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,200
pressure must be still there

658
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:45,600
it's not a game we are actually

659
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,960
simulating a trajectory in their real

660
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:49,918
components blue team also need to

661
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,559
receive almost

662
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:54,559
all these tradecraft iocs and logs

663
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,960
because if you miss something

664
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,080
you need to improve this right all these

665
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,159
gaps can be only

666
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:04,879
fixed using those raw output

667
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,520
and vector can help you to keep those

668
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,240
metric

669
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,679
as well as supporting features uh in a

670
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,039
certain application

671
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,280
vector is also an open source

672
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:15,360
application it manages the ttp details

673
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:17,440
it has micro attack implementation

674
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,639
uh and supporting its back as well as

675
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:21,919
radon blue team

676
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,159
and trade craft mode so if you see a

677
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,559
flag as blue teamer you can register it

678
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,559
there

679
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,879
if your red team describes the certain

680
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,120
actions or certain scenario components

681
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,960
they can add there as well in the end

682
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,840
you can just compare the results and

683
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,200
um actually what attack detected what

684
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,918
attack prevented or

685
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,320
who was most beneficial uh in that case

686
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,799
or

687
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,279
uh who was the most impressive reverse

688
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,279
engineer

689
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:49,360
uplifting game is also important because

690
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,918
the exercise itself

691
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,320
is of course highly complicated and you

692
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:57,440
can start with a smaller exercise

693
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,918
which is great still however the trade

694
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,240
actors

695
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:01,679
uplift their game always so you need to

696
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,240
update your own game

697
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:05,679
you need to improve your purple team

698
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,480
exercises using different

699
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:10,880
purple team ctos using different cq

700
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,559
traffic types using class services maybe

701
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,880
starting from the cloud instead of

702
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,840
targeting detections adding new http

703
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,640
https

704
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,678
protocol such as http 203 for push by

705
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,080
notifications

706
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:25,039
or you can improve some invasive

707
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,918
techniques for example etw bypasses or

708
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:30,240
egr bypasses or just kernel driver

709
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:31,760
compromise to disable edrs

710
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,919
also you can change the past of the

711
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:36,320
exercise of course two three days

712
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:36,960
uh would be good for everyone what if

713
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,840
you

714
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,320
um use an exercise for let's say more

715
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,000
than

716
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,520
uh two months three months which is

717
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,720
blockchain minors or

718
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,200
spreading malware in the organization

719
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,640
organizational waiting stock or cyber

720
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,559
response to find this

721
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:55,279
they are also important in this demo

722
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:57,279
i will try to show you the automation

723
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:59,679
features of patak and how we can use the

724
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:02,559
scenario approach using attack

725
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:03,120
attack has a scenario feature recently

726
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,399
added

727
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:10,479
and this scenario feature is simply

728
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:13,360
json files json files

729
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,720
have actual commands that also run up

730
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,799
attack

731
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,720
if you wonder that what is patak and how

732
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:21,760
you can interactively use it

733
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,960
attacks website already has a video for

734
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:25,679
one hour training

735
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,279
so you can just go to that one and uh

736
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,840
take the brief information as well as

737
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:33,039
training which is fine

738
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:35,439
in this demo i focused on the scenarios

739
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:36,879
this scenario file only has this

740
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:40,080
information thread actor

741
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,559
and ttp ids the dtp id is actually file

742
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:44,960
names

743
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:47,600
for this content http is separated

744
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,279
it is saved under scenarios and ttps

745
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,480
folder

746
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:54,720
and ttps have micro attack id

747
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,320
a user friendly description and

748
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,120
instruction tested is

749
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:01,039
quite small and also quite easy to

750
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,918
understand

751
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,679
for instruction perspective we have

752
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:08,400
certain instruction types

753
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,440
attack supports executing process or

754
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,520
uploading file

755
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,840
downloading a file linking an implant to

756
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,679
implant or sleeping

757
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,439
that would help you to adjust the pace

758
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,000
of the exercise or

759
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,760
some dotnet capabilities such as running

760
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,360
some dotnet stabilizing memory

761
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,879
compiling the source code of that net in

762
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:27,520
memory or

763
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,480
providing batnet to you as a kind of

764
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,879
command shell okay

765
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,240
you can just give your single liner.net

766
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,039
code and it will

767
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,960
compile this in memory and run but also

768
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:39,520
supports some powershell

769
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,640
in system management automation that

770
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:44,799
helps you to test some additional iots

771
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,679
it supports some shell code injection

772
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,039
techniques

773
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,760
as well as some lateral movement

774
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,840
techniques with this combination you can

775
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,960
actually use the real tradecraft such as

776
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,918
power up mimikas

777
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,960
ctel shop move or other wmi or psx

778
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,799
protocols

779
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,400
you can exactly simulate the transactor

780
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,400
with their own tools

781
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,440
that's also possible mimikat of course

782
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,600
mimikas is there

783
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,200
a powerup powerup can be used i don't

784
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,199
need to integrate those

785
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,640
because patek has a baseline for all of

786
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,760
those

787
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:16,320
so the simple commands can be exact but

788
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,080
this is not a good example for seat belt

789
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:19,678
seatbelt application is a dot net

790
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:23,039
application and you can use

791
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:25,760
exec sharp assembly and then file

792
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:27,679
and file path and the parameters to run

793
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,919
that assembly

794
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:31,919
also that net code can be compiled in

795
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,360
memory and you can use this as a kind of

796
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,159
shell for yourself for example

797
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,678
exec shot direct get hostname it will be

798
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,640
compiled run and

799
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:41,600
give the code to you compiling.net

800
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:44,799
source giving a

801
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,279
certain source code in the wild as a

802
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:47,679
file

803
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,799
or through a kind of web service and

804
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,320
running using

805
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,200
some commands in this case charcoal

806
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:57,279
democ injects some sort of shock code

807
00:27:53,200 --> 00:28:00,799
and runs it using a certain uh

808
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:03,679
actual technique two user apc but

809
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,440
this shellcode uh invoke has also an

810
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:08,720
embedded embedded shell code

811
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,200
that can be called using demo

812
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,120
windows management instrumentation can

813
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,080
be also used for lateral momentum attack

814
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,239
has it

815
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:19,120
this is also helpful for all of us

816
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:21,120
because wmi is slightly less monitored

817
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,959
and we can use this for lateral movement

818
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:26,479
but of course you can add here

819
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:30,320
as uh the windows such as exec then

820
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,760
wmic or sc or some other tools

821
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,600
they can be also used for lateral

822
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,840
movement when you link

823
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,039
an implant to implant you can use always

824
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,240
link command like that

825
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:41,679
tcp udp your smb name pipes can be used

826
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,279
for this

827
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:48,880
this practical demo i have a

828
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:50,799
screen for you top left is windows 10

829
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,320
with the victim itself running two

830
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,600
implants as you can see

831
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:58,240
in bottom screen on the patek service

832
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:00,158
and on top right there is also id as

833
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:02,399
well as an exchange

834
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,520
i will run a simple command through an

835
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:06,799
implant

836
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,559
if i run for example exec calc it will

837
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:11,679
run the calculator

838
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:14,240
so we can use exec for anything exactly

839
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,799
cmd slash t and the command itself or

840
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,640
exec

841
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:18,399
powershell and the powershell command it

842
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,679
will be fine this is a powershell

843
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:22,320
example right output

844
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:24,960
username and username is anakin i am

845
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,200
currently working on one single implant

846
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,480
if i need to go back i can use back and

847
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:32,320
i can go back to the

848
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:35,520
interactive screen and main screen or

849
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:38,799
this example is sharp array

850
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,480
i will go back to my screen and i will

851
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,480
talk about the scenarios and i will show

852
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,080
the scenario feature now

853
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,840
this is the list of the implants only

854
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,760
three implants available on the desktop

855
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:51,039
side and no scenarios

856
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:53,039
loaded or run scenario command can be

857
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,000
used with implant id and the scenario

858
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:57,200
file i have shown

859
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,880
you the scenario file points to some

860
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:01,919
http files

861
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:05,600
what service does is quite simple

862
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:08,640
it simply constructs the scenario file

863
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:11,039
using the ttp files

864
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:12,880
one single file includes all the

865
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:14,399
binaries or source code or something

866
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:16,799
like that as a package

867
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:18,799
and it sends this to the implant using

868
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:21,918
the c2 channel

869
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:23,360
through that we have visibility on how

870
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:27,039
it would work

871
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,799
first the logs second the implant also

872
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:30,640
reports this

873
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,799
i'm just showing the implant with

874
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,120
debugging features as you see some

875
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,720
calcs started because of the shell code

876
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:39,039
some commands

877
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:40,399
did run we can see these visual

878
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,279
activities

879
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:44,080
but we always can disable the debugging

880
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,159
features

881
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,240
so the victim will not understand

882
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:50,000
anything but i don't mind this because

883
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,799
patek is a purple team c2

884
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,679
so i need the blue team to see the

885
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,440
details

886
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,799
when the scenario finished we received

887
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,960
the scenario report

888
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:00,720
but there is also something new here

889
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,519
this is implant a new implant

890
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:04,480
it wasn't there so one of our scenario

891
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,960
component

892
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,679
actually added a new implant which is

893
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,760
naboo the exchange server

894
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,880
because it has lateral movement

895
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,120
instruction

896
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:16,960
scenarios can list the scenarios and

897
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:20,080
giving the scenario id

898
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,120
would list the scenario activities in a

899
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:24,320
summary

900
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:27,600
the mitratec id the user-friendly name

901
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:30,158
start and stop timestamps

902
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,120
they are useful to understand when the

903
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:34,399
attack started

904
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:37,360
when it ended and how did it go

905
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:38,000
successful or not if it is successful

906
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,479
the command

907
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,200
did run we don't know about the output

908
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,360
this

909
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,200
should be retrieved through another

910
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,320
command scenarios

911
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,880
scenario id then output that will list

912
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,519
the output for you

913
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,640
so you can see the real-time output here

914
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:58,480
and you can see

915
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:01,519
how it works for example uh for

916
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:05,200
user list we can see how it works

917
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:07,519
exec cmd net users or groups

918
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,880
would list the users just like this the

919
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,960
instruction

920
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,640
and we can see the users but if this is

921
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,159
not a kind of domain controller it will

922
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,720
fail as well what

923
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:17,679
attacks is is the command executed not

924
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,240
the output

925
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,200
access floor output is not a concern we

926
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,519
are trying to

927
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:27,440
uh actually run this ttp this tradecraft

928
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:29,279
this is useful for bluetooth activities

929
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:31,120
so they can search their defense tools

930
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,120
for those timestamps

931
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,320
i added some combinations here such as

932
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,678
normal commands

933
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:40,240
powershell through the system automation

934
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:42,000
it also has some additional for example

935
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,799
dotnet

936
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,840
tools a loadingsome.net assemblies some

937
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,240
source codes

938
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,439
this video will be also online on

939
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,039
patak's web page

940
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:55,600
so you can always jump there and see

941
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:57,200
what are the details implemented here or

942
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,000
you can just download patek and you can

943
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,320
just implement

944
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,919
implement yourself this is seat belt

945
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,519
output for example this is a.net

946
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,360
application it did run and this is the

947
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,679
real-time output

948
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:10,080
and also this is shell code injector and

949
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:13,120
finally of course memory compile example

950
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:13,918
here as well all these are here to

951
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,039
replicate

952
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,080
the trade actor behaviors and that's why

953
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:20,399
i'm just

954
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,000
cutting the demo short here because of

955
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:25,279
the timeline

956
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,519
and now it's conclusion purple team

957
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:29,519
is quite beneficial exercise and it is

958
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:32,559
not an offensive exercise only

959
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:34,559
it is the collaboration so blue team

960
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,600
and red team should work together and

961
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,879
this exercise

962
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,760
must be tailor fit to the organization

963
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,360
their own advisory their own people

964
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,720
their own software and their

965
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:48,080
own risks purple team exercises generate

966
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:50,640
some additional

967
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,360
output for us they are our values the

968
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,360
reports

969
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,279
may include the vulnerabilities our

970
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:58,799
circuit control efficiency

971
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:02,399
skill gaps to be uh improved maybe your

972
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:05,120
uh best guides are way more

973
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:07,199
than expected and you can actually

974
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:08,480
reward them if they represent a really

975
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,639
good performance there

976
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,159
you can always see their organization

977
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,679
performance there as well

978
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:17,919
you have overall controls people and

979
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,440
offensive teams defensive teams you can

980
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,158
see how they work together

981
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,159
but remember that specialists are first

982
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,399
not the software

983
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,320
specialists drive the software they

984
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,118
design the software if you have someone

985
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,040
to develop

986
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:32,800
those straight crafts custom that's

987
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,199
great

988
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,919
these are the research i referred in the

989
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:40,239
automated advisory simulation section

990
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,040
and these are the references that you

991
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:45,040
can uh

992
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:47,759
visit or download those tools attack c2

993
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,359
gear repository will have this

994
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,639
presentation a video

995
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:55,199
after the talk thank you for your time

996
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:56,800
and uh this recording is over but i will

997
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,720
take your questions uh

998
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,960
live shortly thank you for your time

999
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,799
again

1000
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,240
thank you very much fattie and great to

1001
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,760
see you

1002
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:11,359
that's fantastic twice twice

1003
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,000
fun um so there was a bit of a a hiccup

1004
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,759
around

1005
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,119
at the start of the vid so i definitely

1006
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,640
wanted to kind of introduce

1007
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,320
fadi because he's a he's a good friend

1008
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,118
of mine i've known him for many many

1009
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:22,240
years

1010
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:24,160
and in my opinion probably one of the

1011
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,399
the best red teamers in the country so

1012
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:29,279
we're very very fortunate to have him

1013
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,000
um a couple of questions which you were

1014
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,800
kind of answering

1015
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,320
within the um the chat and we do have a

1016
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,640
few minutes for questions but

1017
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,599
one that did come up was um based on red

1018
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,118
team results

1019
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,920
should the purple team decide the

1020
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:44,160
controls to implement

1021
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,280
um the purple team decision maker the

1022
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,920
planning stage

1023
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,680
uh decision makers they are actually the

1024
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,400
stakeholders so we can easily

1025
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:54,000
change this together um the thing is we

1026
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,640
decide on the controls

1027
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,599
based on the red team observations but

1028
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,598
blue team

1029
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,640
actually adjust the security controls

1030
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,480
and make it secure

1031
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:05,118
if the question is based on who will

1032
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,880
secure this they ask for his blue team

1033
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,200
if the question is based on what

1034
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,000
security controls to be included in

1035
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,399
scope

1036
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,480
yes that is decision makers and key

1037
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:17,920
stakeholders for the purple team

1038
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:20,720
so we are fantastic and

1039
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,920
a question from me um based on your

1040
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,720
extensive experience

1041
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:26,640
how do you find the buy-in at a lot of

1042
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:28,319
organizations to have that

1043
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,000
connection between the red team and the

1044
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:31,520
blue team and then creating that purple

1045
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,200
team do you think it's getting better or

1046
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,599
is it still a problem

1047
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,839
uh it is still in the earlier stage uh

1048
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,680
for australia but it is very common in

1049
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:41,599
uh us and europe they have their

1050
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,319
internal purple teams dedicated for this

1051
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,720
purpose

1052
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:46,000
they have their own uh red team for

1053
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,160
their um

1054
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:50,240
internal cyber defense to improve the

1055
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,200
cyber defense for advisory simulations

1056
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,879
they have also

1057
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,879
another rate team dedicated to their

1058
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,880
global operations so they may have

1059
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,200
multiple advisory simulation

1060
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,000
um organization units in the same

1061
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,399
organization

1062
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,359
i can easily name a couple of those such

1063
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,440
as microsoft

1064
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,400
amazon or facebook they have multiple

1065
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,880
stages in

1066
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:09,440
australia it is not at that stage

1067
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,599
however

1068
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,119
uh opera uh and some other financial

1069
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:15,280
institution regulations

1070
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,960
um they require uh the larger

1071
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,760
organizations to have a dedicated

1072
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:21,119
purple team these days that's fantastic

1073
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,680
and we're seeing a lot of

1074
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,040
the threat driven approach to a lot of

1075
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,560
the cyber security

1076
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,640
um and driving a lot of the red team

1077
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:30,560
activity as well overseas

1078
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,118
such as the sea best framework or the

1079
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:36,720
asi one in in singapore you have icast

1080
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:39,520
in hong kong as well know australia

1081
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,399
yeah well the worst kept secret right um

1082
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,759
and

1083
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,240
you know the frameworks that are coming

1084
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,920
into in into these regions do you think

1085
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:49,598
that they're doing enough as well or

1086
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:51,359
or can they do more uh this this really

1087
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,000
depends on a couple of things

1088
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,400
um the first thing is the organizations

1089
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,640
uh

1090
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,560
need to understand that rate team and as

1091
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,680
as well as all advisory simulations they

1092
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,839
are hostile okay

1093
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,200
they are not friendly so are people who

1094
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,880
perform this even though they are

1095
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,520
friendly they will look hostile

1096
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:09,280
this is not easy to integrate to 200

1097
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,680
years old organizations of course there

1098
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,000
will be lots of difficulties and hiccups

1099
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:15,839
but the priorities must align with this

1100
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,920
and they need to have red teams

1101
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,680
they need to have purple teams they need

1102
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:22,000
to have assumptions for those

1103
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,680
because their traditional controls will

1104
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,720
not apply to red teams otherwise it

1105
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,319
won't be a red team

1106
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,000
that's the main problem main challenge

1107
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,560
for older organizations

1108
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:32,480
yeah thank you and that's it for

1109
