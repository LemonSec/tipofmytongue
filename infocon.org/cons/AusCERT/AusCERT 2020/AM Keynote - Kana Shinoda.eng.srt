my story with you a little bit

40
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,159
how launch the various hacker

41
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,159
conferences

42
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,680
so i used to work for blackcut

43
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,680
that was starting point as a japan

44
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,399
operation

45
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:53,119
they had a show in 2004 but i joined

46
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,799
them from 2005.

47
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,880
they found me through the mutual friends

48
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,159
they picked me because i've been to

49
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,360
blackheads so

50
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,240
i know what it is and i can speak

51
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,399
english

52
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,840
and i have done to organize the seminars

53
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,840
a little bit

54
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,920
i learned how to run the hacker

55
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:18,400
conference from blackout

56
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,799
i do the all local works with the

57
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,280
support of ks from singapore

58
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,840
he has done blood cadasia before a japan

59
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,640
show

60
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,599
while the u.s does cfp and the speaker

61
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,160
coordination dells

62
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,200
i was so honored to work for blackett

63
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,160
but that wasn't that easy task at all

64
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,160
that wasn't easy

65
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:46,640
the problem i faced was like

66
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,840
there was no sponsors supporters

67
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,720
i go visit the potential sponsors and

68
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,879
found out they don't support us no one

69
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,000
wants to sponsor us

70
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,079
they worried about the reputation only

71
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,680
the people who loved the black cat and

72
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:06,400
had their budget enough budget sponsors

73
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,640
therefore most of the time it comes from

74
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,319
the research or education budget

75
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,319
not an advertising budget

76
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,399
and some of them even asked why their

77
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,640
website is black

78
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,159
they think it looks like a dark web kind

79
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,238
of site

80
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,720
actually we changed the background color

81
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,840
to white in 2008

82
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,840
for japanese virgin

83
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:33,920
and another question was why nav the

84
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,040
black cat

85
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:41,599
even a big newspaper media as

86
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,599
a jeff moss at the press conference

87
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,560
they there are a lot of

88
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:48,799
misunderstandings actually

89
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,000
i also found out people are not used to

90
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:54,560
the bender neutral conferences

91
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,319
they ask how much is a session if i

92
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,879
sponsor you

93
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,238
it is very very common to see free entry

94
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:03,280
conference

95
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:09,040
or building local entry fee conferences

96
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:10,799
in asia so it's hard to find responses

97
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,640
and there was no japanese hacker

98
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:17,680
communities there at the time

99
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,880
i was gathering information from english

100
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:22,880
sources for security most of the time

101
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,440
so i didn't know if there is a local

102
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,719
community in japan

103
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,240
actually there was a japanese hacker

104
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,280
community

105
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,280
very technical one

106
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,000
that's why i heard they had the mailing

107
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,199
list

108
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,160
and the annual event there even goes

109
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,360
from day

110
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,080
and then after midnight at the club

111
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,840
it sounds cool right i wanted to join

112
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,880
them actually

113
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:54,880
because they are too good

114
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,360
and i mean they are good some english

115
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,360
speakers even joined the event

116
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,360
even all contents are in japanese

117
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,198
but some accident happened by one

118
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,199
speaker

119
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,440
i wasn't there but this is what i heard

120
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,360
he was trying to show some kind of cgi

121
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,240
very beauty things

122
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,960
and his demo movie didn't work out

123
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,120
instead

124
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,479
he had those days and he showed what he

125
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,720
got from the hack

126
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,960
and he showed the data that shouldn't be

127
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,680
pub in public

128
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,919
he's he's not supposed to show but he

129
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,759
accidentally happened

130
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,120
one of the audience was a law

131
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,199
enforcement officer

132
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,479
and the speaker was arrested that was

133
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,440
accident

134
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,560
and the old even staffs went for the

135
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,000
went to the police and

136
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,960
for the investigation too that was the

137
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,840
first case of

138
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,680
unauthorized access prohibition law in

139
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,679
japan uh they had various fashions at

140
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,240
the bbs

141
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,680
perhaps there was some jealousy in the

142
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,880
security community

143
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:04,560
because they were too good after that

144
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,800
incident

145
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,160
the community they shut down the

146
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:11,440
community

147
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,080
that was 2003 a year before black and

148
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,080
japan started

149
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,199
so i learned about it after black and

150
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,840
japan started

151
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,919
i didn't know that so no wonder there's

152
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,318
no community

153
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:30,960
no supporters around so that wasn't easy

154
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,840
but in the meantime i've been looking

155
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,638
for a way

156
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,880
to rebuild the community anyway i didn't

157
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,880
give up

158
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,880
i finally find the ray of light

159
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,240
i found there was drinking party after

160
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,759
black

161
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:52,960
japan there was a group that hosted a

162
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,680
drinking party after the show

163
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,239
it wasn't a big group about dozens of

164
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,680
people

165
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,479
like 30 or 30 or 40 people gathering

166
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,240
and drinking and having fun at izakaya

167
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,240
or above place

168
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,319
the name of the community was tim

169
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,360
chidori

170
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:14,720
i talked to the group reader and asked

171
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,160
if it's okay that black speakers and

172
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,599
jaimos and me

173
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,599
to join their party

174
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,759
they said yes and then

175
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,919
they are into some lighting talks at the

176
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,719
bar

177
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:32,080
or at the drinking places since we

178
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,759
joined

179
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:35,359
even though they don't speak english i

180
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,520
mean japanese uh those

181
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,240
hackers japanese hackers don't not good

182
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,880
at speaking english

183
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,039
but they started to communicate with

184
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,759
black speakers naturally

185
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,400
throw the computer screen and the code

186
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,400
they write

187
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,680
drinks probably help japanese not being

188
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:00,239
shy with poor english

189
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:03,280
and madame talk so

190
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,080
actually black japan causes the law for

191
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:09,119
the simultaneous translation

192
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,440
but here it is i saw it

193
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,240
we we can make an event without

194
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,879
expensive

195
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:20,080
translation so i suggest a group leader

196
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,840
that i know how to run the international

197
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,039
healthcare conferences

198
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:28,080
i will support you logistically so why

199
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:32,080
don't we launch a good conference

200
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,079
he said yes and then

201
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:39,679
evie tokyo started that's how he started

202
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:43,599
in 2008 there's no slaughter is

203
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:46,880
no drink no hack it sounds fun right

204
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,600
uh no translations but a drink drink

205
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,760
helps

206
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:54,880
for them not being shy and also

207
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,120
i suggested to hold a hakka event with a

208
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,320
sponsor without corporate sponsors

209
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,920
from my experiences so we decided to

210
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,519
keep no corporate responses

211
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:08,560
for them for every tokyo some members

212
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,240
don't like this idea so

213
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,160
we decided to set up the individual

214
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,440
sponsors instead individual

215
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,319
so like person not a corporate

216
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,000
so if we talk about the freedom every

217
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:23,120
tokyo was successful

218
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,519
we mix the people from black japan and

219
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:29,600
other local hackers too like speakers

220
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:32,720
and then mix every ah internationally

221
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,720
that was so successful

222
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,720
i thought this would work out you know

223
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,000
after years and

224
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,560
years for both black japan and every

225
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,040
tokyo

226
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:48,880
in a good combination but that was it

227
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:52,160
welcome japan the last one was 2008

228
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,360
and after that didn't return to tokyo

229
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:58,480
due to the lehman's financial crisis

230
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:01,120
in 2008 so

231
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,240
again nebu tokyo became the only event

232
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,839
for hackers

233
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,839
in japan after they left

234
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:13,439
and in 2008 i was asked to run the epw's

235
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,399
conference in tokyo

236
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:18,959
it is called sito's counter e-claim

237
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:22,079
operation summit

238
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:24,719
apwg liked my work

239
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,359
so after and i started to work for them

240
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,560
system

241
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:29,200
i still work for them as a conference

242
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,599
manager

243
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,399
and an asian liaison a pwc holds a event

244
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,760
globally

245
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:42,480
so everywhere in this globe

246
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,480
so i have troubled with them a lot

247
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:49,120
through their events i began to know

248
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,239
more about star people and the law

249
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,760
enforcement people

250
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,880
globally so i i had a lot of hacker

251
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,079
friends but now

252
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:59,680
after you know a pwg work i know more

253
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:03,439
such people involved

254
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:06,239
law enforcement and at the same time

255
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,800
i personally visit the conferences here

256
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,839
and there

257
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,800
to find out more about how communities

258
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,640
around the world

259
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:18,240
like china korea russia europe

260
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,920
everywhere i learned a lot from them

261
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,160
and i made a lot of friends here and

262
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,160
there

263
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:30,560
in the meantime i often ask to

264
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,399
hold the blanket japan again i know

265
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,399
black cats pen again

266
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,680
or please black cat comes to south korea

267
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,800
please please please ask

268
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,760
jeff moss or please ask back at usa they

269
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:45,199
asked me

270
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,519
but i'm not a decision maker and also i

271
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:50,639
talked to the u.s side and then

272
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:52,560
however it seems very difficult to hold

273
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,839
a black hat in non-english-speaking

274
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,000
countries at the

275
00:11:53,839 --> 00:12:00,720
moment in simply is simply because

276
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
it costs a lot and the size of the

277
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,360
community

278
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,360
and the industry mothers too

279
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,439
with those strong demands i kind of

280
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,240
thinking

281
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,399
try to make new hacker conference

282
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,440
instead of the black exam

283
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,639
thus i've been looking for a great male

284
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,000
hacker

285
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,320
to be the founder of it

286
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,360
i've been looking for it for a long long

287
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,079
time

288
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,040
long long time for years and years and

289
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:32,000
one day

290
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,480
when i talked to a friend of mine and he

291
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,480
told me

292
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:41,920
why not you you are the most

293
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,760
passionate for it a most passionate

294
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,800
person should do it

295
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:50,079
it doesn't matter male or female

296
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,439
i will support you if you do i was

297
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,800
surprised

298
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:58,880
because i never thought about it

299
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:02,800
even he said so he would support me

300
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:05,760
he said so but i was scared still

301
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,800
i'm a female and there's no hacker

302
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:11,760
conference

303
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:14,319
founded by a female hacker in this world

304
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,439
founder is a great magnet of hackers

305
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,639
right

306
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:21,440
so how can i be

307
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:23,760
it's been many years past already you

308
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:26,880
know since blackout is gone

309
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:31,519
so after the long considerations

310
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,519
i finally decided to become a founder

311
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:39,040
then i launched the cold blue

312
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,160
that's how cold we started eight years

313
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,800
after

314
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:46,800
the last black span eight years

315
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,199
i create the review boards with the

316
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:52,880
security experts

317
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:57,120
that put those on the pictures

318
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:59,600
they are the magnet for hackers not me

319
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,920
so one time when i went to see one of

320
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,839
the potential sponsors for the first

321
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,920
past year you know i need to do the

322
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:10,000
sponsorships

323
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:12,479
and he asked me are you sure

324
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
are you crazy do you want to sell your

325
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,959
house

326
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,920
he was doubted that i you know the final

327
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,959
sally

328
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:24,079
he knew how expensive to hold an

329
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:27,920
international conference in tokyo

330
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:32,160
so and actually he was right

331
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:34,880
that's kind of ready to sell my house

332
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,040
if needed i didn't want to but if i need

333
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:40,160
it

334
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,480
i told them reviews that i took the risk

335
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,439
if something happened something bad

336
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:46,720
happened

337
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,480
i told them no worries but support call

338
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:52,160
blue

339
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,160
that was my determination

340
00:14:53,360 --> 00:15:00,800
so let me explain but it's called blue

341
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:04,000
uh kobu is a hospital message

342
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:06,719
code it indicates

343
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,519
a patient in need of immediate medical

344
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,399
attention

345
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,720
or that calls for relevant terms to

346
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:15,120
respond immediately

347
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,000
we named the conference after the code

348
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,880
because

349
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,199
we hope to save the world by combining

350
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,320
people's knowledge

351
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:27,760
we also aim to fill these gaps

352
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:30,639
these programs one

353
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,759
tanges we prepare the various

354
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,240
simultaneous

355
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:36,399
interpreters for non-english native

356
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:39,360
speakers

357
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:40,560
if needed i know it costs a lot but i

358
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,360
like to bring the

359
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,959
non-english native speakers to the world

360
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,399
stage because there are a lot of great

361
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,160
speakers i found it

362
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,600
through you know since i traveled a lot

363
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:53,040
i knew that

364
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:56,880
there are a lot number two

365
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:58,880
industries we provide the various topics

366
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,880
trucks to overcome the barriers

367
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:05,839
of the industry not only technical

368
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,360
it's far but not only technical but the

369
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:11,199
law and policy

370
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:15,759
cyber crimes etc we mixed it

371
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:18,479
and then number three use young people

372
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:20,160
we provide scholarships for the great

373
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:23,440
u25 speakers

374
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:26,800
under 25 years old last year

375
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:31,680
one of the two year 25 students received

376
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:34,160
about 25 000 u.s dollars for scholarship

377
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:36,719
we made this to get close attention from

378
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,399
young kids to security we need people

379
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,560
right

380
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,079
we also created the student staff system

381
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,758
too

382
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:49,199
they can attend the sessions by turns

383
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,120
and the last one the gap between the

384
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:55,199
world and japan

385
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:58,320
there are some examples let me show you

386
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,040
okay for the past year we prepared a

387
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:02,720
lecture

388
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:06,159
by toyota chris hux for the past year

389
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:09,280
at the cold blue after we

390
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,240
announced about the press hacking

391
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,359
at the cobu i got many phone calls from

392
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,120
the government

393
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:18,079
and the various other parties about the

394
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:20,958
content what you're going to talk about

395
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:22,159
is this is okay is it dangerous or

396
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,640
something

397
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:25,439
some people may want to stop some people

398
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,000
worried

399
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,120
too worry too much it can be carousel or

400
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,320
something

401
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:36,320
but i explained carefully

402
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:39,600
you know to them and now why we do this

403
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:41,280
they finally understood us

404
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,439
the same thing happened with a network

405
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,240
of device made by japanese manufacturers

406
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,679
too

407
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:50,880
but they understood us and then we

408
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:52,320
uh they became a good uh we became a

409
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,160
good friend

410
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,918
and they bought the regular sponsors of

411
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,679
corporate now

412
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,200
now we have a lot of known security

413
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,559
companies sponsored

414
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:07,600
sponsoring us and

415
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:11,360
ctf i try to organize ctf sometimes

416
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:14,799
that's the only one i couldn't make it

417
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:17,439
couldn't make it happen at the end

418
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,639
some of the top ctf players came to me

419
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,919
and said

420
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:24,400
let us do it cold blue is an

421
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,280
international hacker conference issue

422
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,799
comes

423
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:31,678
with ctf2 they said

424
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,799
they are top players but students young

425
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,360
kids

426
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,720
there's no reason for me to decline

427
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,479
their proposal

428
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:40,480
such young passionate proposal

429
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,039
they created a bullseye cdf a unique cdf

430
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,120
system

431
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:52,960
that competes for express strengths

432
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:57,280
so that is how code rule has begun

433
00:18:52,960 --> 00:19:01,679
and then the next challenge for me is

434
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:04,000
dc global cyber security camp

435
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:06,400
this is a week-long camp with cyber

436
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,120
security training for young students

437
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,000
from participating countries country

438
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,199
currently

439
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,200
we have eight countries

440
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:17,439
this wasn't my idea the reason i made

441
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:21,120
this

442
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:24,799
is because i received a request

443
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,320
from taiwanese professor he wanted to

444
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:30,000
build a platform

445
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,200
for asian human resources he convinced

446
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,960
me to help him

447
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:38,160
for over two years i think

448
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:40,960
at first i didn't say yes

449
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,880
because it sounds like very complicated

450
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:47,360
and difficult

451
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:51,440
but at the end i decided to do it by

452
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:53,120
thinking of the peace in asia

453
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,760
asian countries can be complex

454
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:59,280
relationships sometimes

455
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:02,640
from past history but i thought if young

456
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,678
people could connect with good faith

457
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,080
friendships

458
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,280
before working for the government or

459
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,360
businesses

460
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,760
i think it would definitely help in

461
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:15,840
future incidents

462
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,840
and i think it's worse to try anyway

463
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:21,280
first we propose to propose gcc to

464
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,799
stakeholders

465
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:27,280
in each country and convince them

466
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:28,320
but it took another two years to launch

467
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:32,399
the first one

468
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:36,000
in seoul that was 2019

469
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:39,280
last one was 2020 in tokyo

470
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,840
the beginning of last february

471
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,158
we were kind of lucky it just before

472
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,280
called commit 19 got pandemic

473
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,360
i mean that was started but not panama

474
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,000
yet

475
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,559
so for the next next one is taiwan we

476
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,960
are still

477
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:57,678
thinking how we can do what we can do

478
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,679
for the next one

479
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:06,000
so these are the student smiles i think

480
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,000
it is very worse to try

481
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,440
and global japanese companies are paying

482
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,879
attention to gcc students

483
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:17,039
i know because they want to

484
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,120
hire people with global communication

485
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:21,440
skills and a good technical background

486
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:24,559
in their security department i think

487
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:31,840
same goes to other countries too

488
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:31,840
they can be heroes in future who knows

489
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:37,280
so this is it this is a story i shared

490
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,720
with you today

491
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:45,039
uh thank you very much for your patience

492
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:45,039
and listen to my lecture enjoy the rest

493
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:57,200
thank you very much for that wonderful

494
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:59,120
presentation do you mind if i ask you a

495
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,559
couple of questions

496
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,320
sure okay you must have been nervous

497
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,520
when you first started

498
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,879
in that industry and if people want to

499
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,400
simple questions just do it on the

500
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,200
general chat i'll see them i'll ask them

501
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,200
of conor now

502
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,480
you must have been nervous when when you

503
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,240
started

504
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,559
where where did you find the motivation

505
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,080
the courage to to tackle those big

506
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:23,918
challenges

507
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:26,960
uh i think that smiles from the audience

508
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:28,640
i know uh through from the flightcard

509
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,240
japan

510
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:34,000
it was tough but the people are

511
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,310
happy and they'll find the lifetime

512
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,480
friends and

513
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:39,039
[Music]

514
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,000
and sometimes some people at the jobs

515
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:43,679
too promoted

516
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:48,000
too so the hacker conference

517
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:51,520
i i'm scared but uh it was to try

518
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:55,120
anyway so that makes sense

519
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,960
yes it does in australia we have always

520
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,158
thought of japan

521
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,640
as a very technologically advanced

522
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,640
country

523
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,000
our young women are girls encouraged

524
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,199
to move into technology to move into

525
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,320
computers

526
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,720
to move into security as much as they

527
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,200
could be

528
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:18,640
good question i think to compare with

529
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,760
other countries

530
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:25,360
maybe not much

531
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:28,559
i think korea is a good case

532
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,520
they have a lot of female uh students

533
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:31,600
close to that

534
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,200
learn the technical things at the

535
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,918
university and the college they have

536
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,480
just

537
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,039
i think even they have a cyber security

538
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,440
courses

539
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,480
in the female universities premier

540
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,760
college

541
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:47,279
but japan only you know

542
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:50,799
pure number of people but some people

543
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:54,720
got interested so there's a movement

544
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:58,480
a little bit the there's a

545
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:01,840
community it's it's named ctf cars

546
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:02,240
and that's a bunch of people a female

547
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,600
people

548
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:08,559
female who likes to play ctf

549
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,559
they are very technical

550
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:14,480
if you could do anything that you wanted

551
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,840
what would you do to encourage more

552
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,799
young women to get into this exciting

553
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:22,080
thing

554
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:25,200
hmm if i'm uh you mean you

555
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,600
if i am a college student now what would

556
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,360
you do what policies what ideas do you

557
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,918
think we could do to get more

558
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:33,918
young women involved um

559
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:41,360
[Music]

560
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:44,799
i don't know about the days i think

561
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:48,320
um they often they open mind

562
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,200
more so i created female groups perhaps

563
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,480
i don't know

564
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,679
but uh they encourage

565
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,720
to they are encouraged by seeing the

566
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,320
female

567
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:04,080
hackers so

568
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:07,760
the it means i mean

569
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:11,918
it was to the you know gather the female

570
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:15,360
anyway in the technical code

571
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:19,039
in the technology field someone asks

572
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:22,559
uh a question here from someone watching

573
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:26,000
kana how can foreigners

574
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:30,799
best connect with industries in japan

575
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,799
to work as a cyber security professional

576
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,880
ah can you repeat that again yes if i

577
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:39,440
wanted to work

578
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:41,760
with japanese industry how what is the

579
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,559
best way for me

580
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:47,360
to find contacts connections in japan to

581
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:50,559
work in cyber security

582
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,760
okay uh the easiest one is the code blue

583
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,879
actually

584
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:58,158
you uh kabu is a free entry this year

585
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:01,679
no charge he's just jumping so

586
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:04,880
um and it's english uh it's good

587
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:07,039
i mean it's easy for you guys to uh

588
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:09,600
because it's english and japanese so

589
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,600
it's easy to find your friends there

590
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,799
right there's another question that's

591
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,639
come through uh

592
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:16,240
everyone is saying thank thank you

593
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,000
everyone is saying thank you thank you

594
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:21,600
for your talk we loved it

595
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,200
um rainer asks

596
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,918
it sounds like you faced a lot of

597
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,440
challenges if you were going to do this

598
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:29,520
all again

599
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,159
what is one thing you would do

600
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,158
differently

601
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:42,720
but i think i do the same thing because

602
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:46,000
the those challenges i did the mine best

603
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,640
that was the best i i did so i

604
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,120
there's no regret i think i do the same

605
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,480
thing

606
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:56,879
even in the evening back to the

607
00:26:52,480 --> 00:27:00,960
past someone else asks are there courses

608
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:04,240
in info security being taught in

609
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,440
universities and colleges in japan is

610
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:09,200
there much

611
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:13,039
education yeah there are some

612
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:15,840
increasing more even there is some

613
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:17,679
uh cyber security courses for the high

614
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:20,080
school

615
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:23,360
not the very uh not the big numbers but

616
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:26,000
they're studying they are studying

617
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,639
when it comes to younger people and

618
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,240
getting them

619
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:33,120
excited in this field what age

620
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,000
do you think we should be targeting

621
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,799
five-year-old

622
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,840
10 year old 15 year old when is the best

623
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,799
age

624
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:43,360
for young people to fall in love with

625
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:45,760
this area

626
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,879
it's hard to answer i don't have kids so

627
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:52,480
i i can't answer but um

628
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:55,039
whenever the

629
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,320
i don't know but most of them got into

630
00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:00,559
the hacking

631
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:03,279
after 10 or so but uh george hodz

632
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,080
the first hacking was when he was four

633
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:06,960
so i can't

634
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,960
say that age

635
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:14,320
um i was lucky enough to visit japan
