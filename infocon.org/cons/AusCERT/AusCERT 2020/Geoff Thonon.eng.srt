27
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,159
phishing well

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:13,280

29
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,720
over the jeff video there and we can see

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,400

thank you for the um the afternoon

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,360
session um friday afternoon is usually

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,320
very very hard to

35
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,360
go through and i hope i can entertain

36
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,439
you because you know what

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,560
fishing have you heard of it beforehand

38
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,079
yes you have

39
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,680
do you know how to handle it yes you

40
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,000
probably do but

41
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,600
i well i was asked to do a bit of a

42
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,320
presentation and you know what fishing

43
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,960
is what we do

44
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,158
on a daily basis so um that's what we're

45
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,158
going to be talking about

46
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,680
but i will be extending a little bit

47
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,799
more because what

48
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,759
fishing really entails so what what is

49
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,920
it

50
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,880
where it's going to go what can happen

51
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,799
from fishing

52
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,000
so i will move it a little bit further

53
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,119
yeah this also

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,240
um it depends on what you're looking at

55
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,640
and it's

56
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,000
can take another name if you wanted to

57
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,759
and we will going to

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,199
do that particularly is going to

59
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:11,680
investigate pretty much

60
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,599
what other names you could call it um so

61
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,480
that we have the right mind frame to be

62
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,440
able to see what

63
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,480
um phishing does and what it entails to

64
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,160
your organization

65
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,679
and also yourself and personal life

66
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,560
because you know what they don't uh

67
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,319
discriminate in

68
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,160
pretty much of uh the organizations or

69
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,560
not um

70
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,319
also we also also want to talk about uh

71
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,760
the fact that yes on also the website we

72
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,599
also talk about fishing takedowns but

73
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,879
there's a whole lot more that we do

74
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,319
um so as the um introduction

75
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,480
also talks is there's a whole lot more

76
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,958
that we do in behind

77
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,879
the scenes but also let's not talk about

78
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,720
what we do but what could be done

79
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,560
or needs to be done uh in the back of

80
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,519
the scene so uh don't worry about what

81
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,879
also it really does

82
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,560
it's what can be done so um

83
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,160
i just really want to be able to start

84
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,000
into um

85
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,000
what fishing entails uh for an

86
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,360
individual what could we call it what

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,560
else could we call it

88
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,360
fishing okay no problems um yeah well we

89
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,280
call it

90
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,400
fraudulent you know someone's trying to

91
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,480
take care or

92
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,920
trying to take the identity of someone

93
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,879
else and to be able to

94
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,679
make use of do something else that's

95
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,599
usually done

96
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,080
as well um uh you'd possibly tailor the

97
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:26,079
message around and then send it over to

98
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,720
uh let's say to a large person a whaling

99
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,599
campaign that's okay spoofing okay

100
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,959
tricking

101
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,839
we're all trying to invoke pretty much

102
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,239
all these emotions out instead of just

103
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,840
fishing okay it could be just oh you

104
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:39,519
could call it malicious you could call

105
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,640
it cheating you could call it praying

106
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:44,640
you could abusing

107
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,958
fooling nasty nastier by any other name

108
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,559
yes it could be well let's have a look

109
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,680
at what happens for the organization

110
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,519
itself as well

111
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,120
okay because uh phishing is nice but

112
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:56,720
what about the objective uh

113
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,280
for uh the organization okay so sorry it

114
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:00,159
went

115
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:01,920
there was a bit of a delay that's all um

116
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,359
for an organization well you could say

117
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,159
well it's trespassing

118
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,519
you uh you get into an organization

119
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,239
because you went through and did some

120
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,239
fishing by

121
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,280
collecting the credentials and then

122
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,200
going through

123
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,480
yes it's a little bit more extended than

124
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,000
what we just talked about

125
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,519
perhaps you have a concept of phishing

126
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,358
is just that email

127
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,959
but perhaps there's a little bit more to

128
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,400
it and that's how come we're going we're

129
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,840
doing this presentation

130
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,880
thieving impersonating destruction of

131
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,719
property

132
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,719
stealing infringement ripping off

133
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,840
now when you go through these words

134
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,440
fishing

135
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,000
well fishing sounds a bit benign

136
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,280
sort of like it's okay it's fine you

137
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,400
don't have to worry about it

138
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,198
it's called fishing well no really

139
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,039
it's nasty it's really nasty we just try

140
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,639
to travelize it so we can do a

141
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,160
conversation in front of the board or

142
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,800
whoever we're going to talk about

143
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,320
uh talk to to be able to uh sort of like

144
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,800
calm them down hey okay we're taking

145
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,840
care of fishing but in the background

146
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,479
we're saying

147
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,000
we've lost our credentials we've got to

148
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,080
take care of it

149
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,039
that would freak out people on the board

150
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,240
but if you say we're taking care of

151
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:10,080
fishing and we're seeing who's going to

152
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,560
be uh who is going to interact

153
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,639
with phishing it's better than saying

154
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,120
which staff is going to actually send

155
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,000
their

156
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,520
username and password at the door we try

157
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,639
to trivialize it because we try to make

158
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,639
a conversation out of it

159
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,240
well no that's okay we try to debase

160
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,919
what fishing really is

161
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,160
when we try to make fun of it a little

162
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:32,320
bit we marginalize it as well

163
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:35,360
and also you know what we also use it as

164
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,479
user training user and we provide a

165
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,479
management report of seeing

166
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,120
how many people would actually put in

167
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,360
those things we actively

168
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:45,120
put and fish our own stuff mind you

169
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,320
there's also the caveat of

170
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,720
you have to uh to be able to be okay and

171
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,479
not

172
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,759
be in legal trouble have to tell them

173
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,680
that hey hang on

174
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,120
we're going to be fishing you which sort

175
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,160
of like defeats the purpose of what

176
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,440
we're going to be doing because the bad

177
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,440
guys don't they just go

178
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,039
okay let's go let's do it we've got a

179
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,479
whole stack of people throw it out

180
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,479
and really attractive email too

181
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,800
so we actually use it for for true user

182
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,360
training which is kind of weird because

183
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,319
you know

184
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,759
what i would expect i mean uh these are

185
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,319
my own thoughts and thoughts i'd like to

186
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,639
be able to

187
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,479
to share to be able to change ideas it's

188
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,560
not the uh thoughts of any

189
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,758
organization or whatever maybe it's just

190
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,600
things i'm going to be sharing

191
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,199
um so user training perhaps that's not

192
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,039
the only thing

193
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:28,880
yeah so throughout the slide actually

194
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,840
perhaps that's the disclaimer i should

195
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,240
put at the start

196
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:33,198
is um what i'm going to be able to show

197
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,280
you in um

198
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,039
or talk to you about is and walk you

199
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:39,679
through is pretty much

200
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,520
um some thoughts and some ideas that you

201
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,800
know you may want to uh integrate

202
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,120
when you hear about fishing so when if

203
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,960
a takeaway from this particular talk you

204
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,160
go oh when you hear fishing

205
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:55,280
you start going shivers down your spine

206
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,960
then i have succeeded because well we'll

207
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,440
do an extrapolation there

208
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,080
um what if in a situation and see what

209
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,479
how

210
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,758
how it look like so what really is it

211
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,000
used for

212
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,440
it's to get to the organization and then

213
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,280
to spread stuff

214
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,800
through the organization and from the

215
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,039
organization

216
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,120
why because hey look even if you are

217
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:19,360
super super super tight

218
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,440
soup um okay uh super

219
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,560
okay sorry the screen went a little bit

220
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,280
weird that's okay

221
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,080
um even if you are super protected okay

222
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,758
and you've got

223
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,440
uh whatever you need to to protect

224
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,240
yourself and it's okay

225
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,599
you still are vulnerable for fishing

226
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,000
from an organization that you know

227
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,680
you're gonna white list it if you if you

228
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,360
stop it at that level

229
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,039
you're gonna be able to uh have

230
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,639
interactions with that organization but

231
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,039
they got fixed they got credentials and

232
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,240
then

233
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,159
they're sending emails from their

234
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,120
organization to you

235
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,919
yeah and if it's in conversation you're

236
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,319
going to click it

237
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,960
it's a be able to spread coming through

238
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,080
so

239
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,599
mitre has got a bit of a and here are

240
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,840
some good words

241
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,520
recon it's weaponized perhaps you're

242
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:06,318
they're trying to figure out who else to

243
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,039
hop from you you're not the target the

244
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,879
next one is

245
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,440
your supply your supplier your your

246
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:14,000
clients and webinars deliver exploit

247
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,719
control oh i execute well that's we'll

248
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,560
talk about that

249
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:21,280
or perhaps okay so what's in it fish

250
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,560
well well there's a lot of things a lot

251
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,559
of different types of fish and it's hard

252
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,639
to be able to just talk about

253
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,800
yes we we think about the phishing of

254
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,319
credentials as the uh the only time

255
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,560
but if you think about it okay no

256
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,519
problems i get a fish i get

257
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,559
an email business email compromise um i

258
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,000
get something to get

259
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:43,119
credentials you've got it can be done by

260
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,480
a url or a militia uh that you send

261
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,959
through or you can ask for an email and

262
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,560
just

263
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,680
ask the credentials that way there's a

264
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,319
different mode so what we're going to be

265
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,760
doing is

266
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,160
going through different types of

267
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,720
different modes and we're print perhaps

268
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,279
you can stop it okay the first one i

269
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,720
call it

270
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:03,120
nothing but mail that's it okay

271
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,480
uh just trying to send uh information to

272
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:08,320
uh to a person

273
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,800
just to get them to react at least

274
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,160
perhaps to use it for other means hey

275
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,240
hang on this person has

276
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,439
responded it's got an email trace you

277
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,640
put that email trace

278
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:20,800
and then you send it to someone else

279
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,000
even the most mundane piece of

280
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,120
information can be used

281
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,720
for further attacks so that's it or it

282
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,320
could be just uh transfer some money i

283
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,880
mean because you've um

284
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,880
there's a prince that needs to be helped

285
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,480
out and he has to move a lot of gold but

286
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,880
hey anyway it doesn't matter

287
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,920
so how do we stop it well there's a few

288
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,200
things that we can do

289
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,800
um and it really depends on a whole lot

290
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,920
of good world and whether it breaks the

291
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,599
terms of service of

292
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,360
the people taking care of the domain

293
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,240
registrar well i have a look at that and

294
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:51,600
say look

295
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,120
well this domains uh is up um it doesn't

296
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,600
perhaps have a website

297
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,320
particularly it just sends strange uh

298
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,959
emails that

299
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,920
looks like and the domain is looks like

300
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,920
uh

301
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,599
the real organization trying to be

302
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,880
fraudulent and try to get

303
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,440
that person to react at least um

304
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,640
your mail server finally and because of

305
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:13,120
the host

306
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,560
having a look at the actual content

307
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,279
itself why because it's useful

308
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,640
share that information around this is

309
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,959
the pattern that they're using

310
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:24,720
and perhaps if you share to write people

311
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,079
who understand what to do with it they

312
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,240
go okay fair enough i can

313
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,199
filter all the emails that come through

314
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,000
that look

315
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:35,839
like this i saw it on the internet

316
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,360
well if it's on the intent it should be

317
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,120
true right okay so anyway

318
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,560
uh mail server you've got domain

319
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,839
registrar you've got a website host but

320
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,839
what's different about this is that

321
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:46,160
there's actually an interaction okay so

322
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,279
it's not just uh sending back an email

323
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,680
the person who's uh in it gets uh

324
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,320
to interact with a perhaps a fish page

325
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,839
that's good

326
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,959
or there is a link to a a file host that

327
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,399
downloads it

328
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:00,239
well you can have that in a couple of

329
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,160
ways okay and um

330
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,000
download a malware by all means have a

331
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,760
look at it you know

332
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,760
you can do the domain registrar the

333
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,959
website host mail server

334
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,560
and file host how you can do it well you

335
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,479
just send an email and say hey

336
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,479
please this is kind of weird uh please

337
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,320
take it down and you always have to

338
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,600
lean on the fact that it is a term of

339
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,360
service they have because it

340
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,600
you know what it could not perhaps it's

341
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:26,160
not in australia generally it's not okay

342
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,079
especially for trying to be uh stealthy

343
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:32,079
they actually are across jurisdiction

344
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:33,920
by the time you get uh offices and uh

345
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,319
authorities on it you know what they've

346
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,319
already

347
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,519
done their deed and they're walking out

348
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,440
with a big grin

349
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,279
um so what you need to do is you need to

350
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,480
be able to react really really fast and

351
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:44,800
be able to ask them to

352
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,600
take down and generally what you do is

353
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,000
you start

354
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,279
asking nicely and then persuading and

355
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,880
you could go through the

356
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,800
uh the people who host and then the

357
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,480
search of the the country that people

358
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,560
host and then do it over again

359
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,839
because perhaps on the first email they

360
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,800
haven't got the idea

361
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,320
that you should take it down so there is

362
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,079
a whole lot of persistence as well that

363
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,000
we need to be able to do to be able to

364
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,319
bring these infrastructure down okay

365
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,240
that's what we're trying to do so

366
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:17,839
i saw it on the internet the next type

367
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,279
is christmas comes early well guess what

368
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,680
well you get that phishing email it's

369
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:23,600
got a malware attached okay no problems

370
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:27,439
it gets installed into your there

371
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,800
because you've enabled macro

372
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,680
and then it talks to a file host and

373
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,639
then uh installs more uh more bugs oh my

374
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,959
goodness great as me

375
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,959
and then uh that's it it talks to a c2

376
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:40,399
server a command control server

377
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:43,439
and your organization becomes a platform

378
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:46,000
okay this get this starts with a phish

379
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:47,279
starts with uh incense and the email

380
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,120
that comes in through it's business

381
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,760
email compromise yeah sure enough

382
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,880
but we need to handle because it goes

383
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,000
through the same

384
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,200
method we need to do the same things do

385
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,040
a take down

386
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,240
please infrastructure so we there's a

387
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,880
whole lot of things that we need to

388
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,920
handle

389
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,399
okay double quarter pounder with cheese

390
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,479
and this is

391
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,680
a lot it sounds unhealthy because this

392
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,519
is unhealthy

393
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,839
um so you got domain registration you

394
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:14,160
send the email goes through file host

395
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,839
tries to get money out of out of it uh

396
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,800
pretty much i'll walk you through

397
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,000
slowly you get an email it sounds like

398
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,880
it's well crafted

399
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,519
okay at the start and email's crafted

400
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,760
and then

401
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,639
someone actually uh interacts with it

402
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,680
goes into

403
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,160
to it clicks on it and then it goes over

404
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,079
and

405
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,600
downloads because you've clicked on it

406
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,399
and you enabled micro

407
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,160
and downloads a uh a malware so you've

408
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,040
got the file hosted taking care of the

409
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,920
website host

410
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,480
and then it goes back to a c2 server and

411
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,319
say look

412
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,839
what do you want me to do well it's okay

413
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,560
no problems don't do anything at this

414
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,800
moment in time

415
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,760
sit for a while and then download

416
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,120
another file

417
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,279
okay because perhaps people try to

418
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,959
analyze it and they sit there for quite

419
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,279
a few quite a long time

420
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:00,638
before they show you what they really do

421
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:02,079
and then comes back and then sits on

422
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,600
your computer until you try to do some

423
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,800
interactions with a bank

424
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,800
and then it takes the details

425
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,120
well perhaps there is a particular thing

426
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,959
that does that

427
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:18,639
yep emote uh this is exactly what we're

428
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,079
uh we're talking about the the double

429
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,240
uh double quarter pounder with

430
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,839
cheeseburger and um

431
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,760
you have the delivery and i want you to

432
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,720
concentrate pretty much on the items as

433
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:30,160
well okay there's

434
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:32,320
delivery bulk spam and targeted email

435
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,240
how did they get the email addresses

436
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,160
well you say it's it's a given jeff

437
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,600
it's a given jeff but i want you to

438
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,040
think about it a little bit later on

439
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,600
we're going to expand on it especially

440
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,399
with

441
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,800
targeted emails in conversation and used

442
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,600
uh

443
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,880
users leaked attachments it's trying to

444
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,399
make and craft that

445
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,480
that email in a certain way that you

446
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:53,839
open that attachment or able to

447
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:55,600
um interact with it okay sends your

448
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,519
computer to a different url that's

449
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,000
exactly what i would talk to you about

450
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,600
i've put in pretty much the containers

451
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,399
that it tries to use

452
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:05,920
okay whether it is a dock in excel pdf

453
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:08,000
or just an embedded url

454
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,000
just to get you to make sure you drop

455
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,360
drops of the inverted malware which is

456
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,360
just a

457
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,600
stepping stone to be able to then uh

458
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:17,440
download a friend as such it tries to do

459
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,560
brute forcing left right and center

460
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:22,720
um then um tries to the

461
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:24,959
there's another one that uh the trackbot

462
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,240
let's say uh communicator c2 server and

463
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:29,599
it sits there and says

464
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,560
well how else can we make money

465
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,360
ransomware downloads execute and starts

466
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,399
again

467
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,360
okay simple fact is and like i've put it

468
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,839
at the bottom

469
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,399
attachment based me mail is always going

470
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:44,160
to work perhaps that's why we use as a

471
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,000
gate to see whether users are going to

472
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,120
be uh interacting with it

473
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,959
because it's they're always going to

474
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,519
work there's always going to be a report

475
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,680
saying

476
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,639
yes people have clicked on it yes people

477
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,719
will because

478
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,680
it'll happen over and again especially

479
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,959
when the uh the email is well crafted

480
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:03,279
okay so um it's pretty pretty harsh

481
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:05,279
um now the way we deal with it is trying

482
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,639
to figure out a model out of it okay

483
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:10,480
what we've talked about the uh

484
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,000
double quarter pounder with cheese is

485
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,720
the fact that uh you know

486
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,519
there's an interaction between email

487
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,079
malware

488
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,560
and url call it the emu model perhaps

489
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,880
okay

490
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,800
and there is a model that we uh we do

491
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,160
use to be able to get our heads around

492
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,319
it until we finished and got

493
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,519
all the indication of compromises at

494
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,720
least the ones we

495
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:32,720
want to continue on but we as

496
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,759
also we need to track them or whoever's

497
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,680
going to take care of them needs to

498
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:40,000
track them

499
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:43,519
this is a bit of a task and um

500
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,399
it has come to sometimes a frustration

501
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,160
of going like

502
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,000
we have a tool it doesn't do exactly

503
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,680
what we want to so

504
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,680
one of our analysts has gone no i'm

505
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:55,279
going to be hero with this and

506
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:58,319
code it that's it so

507
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,880
our one of the staff again i don't want

508
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,480
to go into

509
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,920
details unless i come up with page

510
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,000
details dot dot dot

511
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,359
because this person may want to do some

512
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,839
presentation next year

513
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,799
or which is pretty close in may um about

514
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,678
this particular

515
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,879
uh tool i don't know but i don't want to

516
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:14,240
put him on spot but

517
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,000
what i really want to talk about is the

518
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,880
fact that we need to track it and see

519
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,199
whether

520
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,559
the request that we made was working or

521
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,959
not

522
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:24,399
and see if we have to resent another one

523
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,280
and here's the track of one of them that

524
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,480
we've looked at

525
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:30,240
okay basically kind of

526
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,240
it's there it's there it's kind of

527
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:33,760
flickering a little bit uh it's there

528
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,799
it's flickers a little bit again

529
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,400
with the 200 and then finally it's down

530
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,559
okay so we've got to bring it down and

531
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:44,880
as far as it one particular request

532
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:48,080
may not work all that well okay

533
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,880
but this person who made this uh for us

534
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,520
is

535
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,160
okay perhaps it's a pretty big word

536
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,840
right now it's

537
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:58,720
a hero but really found a thing to do

538
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,159
and put head down and when know what we

539
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,919
have as a tool beforehand

540
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:05,120
is not good enough we need to be able to

541
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:08,480
put and starts making their own tool

542
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,479
okay think of it about um uh let's say

543
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,160
uh batman making another another tool

544
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:14,160
for himself another trick that he's got

545
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,679
another harpoon okay and going like

546
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,320
that's it and that's it i want to be

547
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,400
able to

548
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,080
take care of this particular incident

549
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,640
faster better

550
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:23,199
easier track hit so that we can do more

551
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,120
with it

552
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,320
and then we can provide more uh

553
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,039
information back about

554
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,000
how fast these particular isps perhaps

555
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,640
are

556
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,440
reacting but no i see heroes and they're

557
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,799
everywhere

558
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,320
it doesn't have to be just our staff

559
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,918
there's there's a whole lot of stuff

560
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,159
something happening

561
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,240
let's go back to the motet one okay you

562
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,480
moted well okay fair enough it's got

563
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,520
different uh items and different

564
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,799
interactions i

565
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:50,879
called it pretty much the double

566
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,840
quarter pounder with cheese it's the big

567
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,240
one okay and

568
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,360
so sophisticated that uh perhaps a whole

569
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,799
of people went

570
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:00,799
uh oh we got to step up

571
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:02,400
we got to be the heroes and we got to

572
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,000
spend a bit of time

573
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,600
together to be able to tell the

574
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:09,280
community hey hang on

575
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:12,480
there's an issue and they do

576
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,480
it's um for emote i mean that's the one

577
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,520
uh to uh to look at at this moment in

578
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,679
time uh

579
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,120
it could change it doesn't matter i mean

580
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,120
heroes do get tired

581
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,799
and move on to other things perhaps they

582
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,360
get interested with other things

583
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:27,120
um but again there's a whole group of

584
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,000
people who came together and went

585
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,120
nut we got to stand up we've got a

586
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,559
mission to take

587
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:37,439
we've got a a task to take on to protect

588
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:38,639
who we think is needs to be protected

589
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,520
and so they've

590
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,960
post on uh as often as they can to be

591
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,639
able to say look hang on

592
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,000
this is the indication of compromises

593
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,000
that you're looking for

594
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,120
this is where you want to stop this is

595
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,960
one of when

596
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,559
you're you look at the network and

597
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,760
you've got a phishing email that goes

598
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,440
through

599
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,760
if there's network interaction and you

600
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,799
see this particular website

601
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,720
clock it and they'll try to keep as fast

602
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,600
as possible because they're on a race

603
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,240
they realize they

604
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,439
definitely are on race there's leagues

605
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,520
of extraordinary

606
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,720
cyber security personnel okay whole

607
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,480
groups of people who have

608
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,720
who are leagues so themselves like this

609
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,919
is just two of them who uh

610
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,880
go on um who go okay fair enough we need

611
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,320
to protect

612
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:25,360
the medical industry

613
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,520
okay so then that's it cdi league

614
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,039
you've also got another group who are

615
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,720
again a non-profit organization

616
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:34,320
registering as an australian

617
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:37,679
charity okay who are taking on that task

618
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,879
of restoring the ideas of people of

619
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,919
helping out

620
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:44,080
okay so there again there's a mission

621
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,080
we need to do it there's no island no

622
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,240
one else who's doing it

623
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,760
we've got to take it on our own task

624
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,400
there's something happening bad in this

625
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,158
society

626
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,840
we need to be able to help it that's the

627
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:59,280
hero mentality

628
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:59,280
okay fish so what

629
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,640
so let's learn from the educators um

630
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,080
uh let's have a look at what they've

631
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,120
pretty much experienced as well

632
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:14,799
okay um

633
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:16,479
sans has had a data breach but i want to

634
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:18,720
talk about the fact that they've

635
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:22,400
actually had it really well disclaimer

636
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:23,919
yes sans is uh a sponsor of this

637
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,400
particular conference but no i'm not

638
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:27,679
trying to

639
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,159
uh i'm not trying to uh mix it over and

640
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,320
provide

641
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,679
any uh attention but actually they did

642
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,520
their educators

643
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:35,520
have actually taken their uh their

644
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,280
incident and shared they've

645
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,799
realized that hey hang on we have a duty

646
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:42,080
to be able to then

647
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:44,400
talk about it hit on 24th of july okay

648
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,000
uh fourth of august detect 11th of

649
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,320
august reported

650
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,840
and they say okay fair enough if 513

651
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,039
emails were forwarded this is all from

652
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,158
their uh the website

653
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:57,120
okay uh 28 000 records of pii email

654
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,679
work first first name last name you see

655
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,639
that

656
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,640
but it was regarded as soft credentials

657
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,158
yeah okay so it's not credentials for

658
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,960
that organization

659
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,840
so this is where i i i step away from

660
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,120
sounding as if

661
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:13,840
it's all that good and great because i

662
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:16,239
just talked about

663
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,120
a whole group that uh id care that takes

664
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,159
care of people

665
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:22,559
who lost their id or or item

666
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,440
sure enough it's not really hard stuff

667
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,600
but

668
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,080
these credentials could be such as

669
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,760
emails work title first name last name

670
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,600
workplace company industry

671
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,158
address and country of residence could

672
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,799
be amassed into a database to be able to

673
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,159
then

674
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:39,679
further other attacks here's the thing

675

possible

695
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,960

okay

699
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:32,879
so crafting an email how do you do that

700
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,480
well i get it gave him a bit of an idea

701
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,799
you try to

702
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,080
get the person excited but how do you go

703
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,120
about crafting an

704
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,439
email that is going to be successful

705
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:45,039
okay well you invoke an emotion that's

706
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,279
it you tack delay right yeah okay

707
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,080
there's only seven in the osi model yes

708
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,320
but that's it

709
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:52,480
people is the next one you're going to

710
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,439
have technical controls as well as you

711
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,480
want you've got

712
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,760
dkim you can have different uh d-mark

713
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,360
whatever you want to go

714
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,320
um but at the end of the day um

715
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,199
what you're trying to do is you're

716
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:07,200
trying to get the person

717
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:09,279
to be able to do something they're not

718
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,559
supposed to be doing

719
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:14,720
enable macros that's a big no-no

720
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,918
but it needs to be done perhaps it's

721
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,720
because we also

722
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,200
provide these loops these hoops that we

723
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,000
ask

724
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,960
these people to to go through our users

725
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,840
you need to

726
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,520
yes it is uh quarantined you need to

727
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,840
click to be able to

728
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,960
you need to click okay so we'll get used

729
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,760
to it anyway

730
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,480
invoking an emotion any type of emotion

731
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,559
and

732
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,760
what can how you need to do it well you

733
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,440
talk look at

734
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,320
the person and their what they do what

735
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:44,799
they're interested in

736
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,080
it stands out to well perhaps okay it

737
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,960
doesn't have to be that it can be

738
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,320
anything else

739
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,000
you get information anything that

740
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,840
they've done or

741
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,600
interest with a security tool they'll

742
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,559
get me uh

743
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,840
i'll i'll have to double check so hey

744
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:01,520
new security tool jeff

745
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:03,840
check it out and i'll be going

746
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,559
right okay that's an emotional i'd be

747
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,520
very happy

748
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,639
so um yes there's different emotions you

749
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,360
try to to create

750
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,400
as long as you got one you're done how

751
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,000
do you get the information

752
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,600
of who to send and what they're

753
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,440
interested in

754
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,439
social media databases whatever it may

755
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,039
be they're lying everywhere

756
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,200
and they're all for sale one way or

757
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:25,919
another or public release

758
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:29,279
that's quite amazing too so you're part

759
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:31,120
of a third party you've got um

760
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,640
an email address and that you link to

761
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,399
perhaps they can also link

762
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,000
your hotmail account with your workmail

763
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,840
account because you've shared in

764
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,440
a leak database that provides that

765
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,240
relationship and then you can start

766
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,240
providing that

767
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:44,480
relationship database as well of people

768
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,559
not religion or database

769
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,240
of people and what they like what they

770
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,000
do where they work

771
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,840
uh what are their preferences and then

772
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,799
be able to then craft that email

773
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,760
really nicely so you can fish and

774
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,559
defraud them

775
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:59,520
and get them to click but hey well we'll

776
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,799
see

777
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,520
so i was trying to figure out what would

778
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:06,720
be a really good email to uh to do

779
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:10,080
and i thought well thank you

780
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,159
social media you did it for me um

781
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:13,678
the gods have done it for me and i

782
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:15,520
thought well hang on perhaps this will

783
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,919
get people to to click on it

784
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,520
dc marvel's a marvel now i'm not going

785
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:21,760
to go any further than that apart from

786
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:24,158
click here and then the person will be

787
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:27,039
interested to have a look at

788
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,400
so what can we do well there's a few

789
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,400
things we can do about it

790
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,679
sure you can do fishing takedowns uh you

791
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,440
can also do whack-a-mole

792
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:37,600
that's also a thing but it comes to the

793
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,480
person it comes to layer eight okay so

794
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,959
we can do

795
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,320
i suppose some awareness campaign

796
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,919
something i'd like to push people

797
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,918
towards through instead of

798
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,440
uh trying to see if they're gonna click

799
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,919
because you know what

800
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,600
nine percent eight percent you know ball

801
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,640
back figure

802
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,480
they're gonna click so anyway so uh

803
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,720
just to make sure that it is that what

804
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,720
you can do is just put that money into

805
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,799
uh better monitoring and seeing how it

806
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,679
is so the idea is to see whether it's an

807
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:06,559
email a bug

808
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,480
url a phishing site see a master

809
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,279
database and do a report on a monthly

810
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,200
basis

811
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,880
do that report and send it over to the

812
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,559
security uh

813
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,880
person who then makes that report and

814
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:18,879
goes to the manager and then to gently

815
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:20,399
push the staff and say okay hang on this

816
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,360
is really important

817
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,840
the real manager gets the report every

818
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,760
month

819
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,360
not on that phishing campaign once often

820
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,080
that said haha

821
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,959
to prove that perhaps the way uh the the

822
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,960
training that happened

823
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,399
with fish works you know what you tell

824
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,399
them they're going to be fished

825
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:38,879
then you fish then you give them

826
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:40,239
training then you do fishing again

827
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,000
there is going to be at that moment in

828
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,279
time an improvement but

829
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,679
what about a couple months down the

830
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,600
track oh well never mind

831
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,039
so as long that may work to some

832
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,000
organizations as long as they've got a

833
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,240
culture of uh

834
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,279
being nice with each other um that's so

835
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,679
good

836
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,799
another one you could do you can

837
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,320
incentivize them

838
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:01,760
going i i think i

839
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,158
will be the hero because i'm the one

840
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:06,559
who's detected oh they go

841
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,840
we can be heroes we can tell your staff

842
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:11,200
we can be heroes

843
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,158
you say look you're a hero and if you're

844
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,399
able to then

845
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,360
click on that reporter's phishing we'll

846
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,039
get a copy

847
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,479
we can do that monitoring as well and

848
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,559
you give them a prize

849
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,080
don't make that prize too good or else

850
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,120
you perhaps you'll have more fish on

851
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,960
that organization

852
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,559
but anyway just uh make it deserve like

853
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,360
a bragging rights of some kind

854
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,559
okay they'll be awesome get get them to

855
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,719
be part of the

856
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,840
uh the loop to be able to take care of

857
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,520
it

858
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:40,158
another one which is really tricky

859
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,720
because it's a bit scary it's a bit

860
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:46,240
scary to make everybody heroes

861
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,000
because empowerment empowerment to be

862
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,279
able to have a look at when they get one

863
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:54,480
okay where is it what is it is it from

864
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,960
uh what i expected and perhaps to show

865
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,720
them

866
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,480
some of the tricks and the tools that

867
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,240
you can use in xbox

868
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:02,399
for those in the industry have a look at

869
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,760
it okay you probably already know that

870
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,520
another one another trick another

871
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,600
superpower you can use is

872
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:09,120
url scanio hey there's the tracking

873
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,559
there there's a check

874
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,719
and there's also i'll see whether it's

875
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,678
okay or not okay and say

876
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,559
yes google have define defined it as not

877
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:18,720
safe

878
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,879
it is a site and it links a whole lot of

879
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,320
people these are also not only the

880
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,039
people who created these tools made

881
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,360
available

882
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:27,120
for everybody our heroes but you know

883
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,959
what you can make your staff perhaps

884
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,760
heroes as well to be able to then

885
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,320
use this superpower i mean how else

886
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,919
would you

887
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,520
do it it's it's a tool it's an

888
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,480
eye-opening of what's happening

889
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,080
outside virustotal everybody's going in

890
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,799
the industry who's ever used viruses

891
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,240
going yeah yeah

892
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:44,879
yeah yes why not how about you have your

893
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,440
users

894
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,799
become and have that superpower to

895
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,320
understand that this

896
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,960
is really dangerous okay um the sample

897
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,158
is

898
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,360
not but anyway that's okay um

899
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,440
it was something else that was false

900
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,559
positive that's okay uh well and this

901
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,240
one also as well

902
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:04,559
there's a cert out there who decided to

903
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,720
be able to okay okay we want to collect

904
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,879
information or whatsapp we're opening it

905
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,360
up we're spending a bit of time

906
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:12,240
and you can cuckoo and there's a whole

907
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,320
lot of different

908
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,480
super powers you can have and uh to make

909
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:19,200
your uh your users heroes

910
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,559
okay you can choose the superpower that

911
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,679
you want them to have

912
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:26,158
okay pick one

913
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,279
pick them all okay of course i haven't

914
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,480
got all of them here

915
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:30,559
but you've got different ones you can

916
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,880
have the one the person in there who has

917
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:34,080
the intel the one that they can be able

918
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,320
to outreach

919
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,199
the one that can uh stretch themselves

920
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,678
really well

921
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:41,279
okay you get what my meaning you all

922
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,320
these are different superpowers you can

923
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:44,480
uh provide

924
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,240
it's a bit of a mix because you know

925
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,679
what policy i understand

926
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,279
perhaps you don't want your users to

927
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:52,159
spend a lot of time on

928
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:53,120
on doing fishing but perhaps there's

929
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,399
something then you need to

930
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:59,279
think about make them superheroes um

931
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:01,039
it's a bit of a it's a bit of a tell no

932
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:05,360
it's uh

933
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:08,720
so let's creatively extrapolate

934
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:11,760
okay now um

935
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:12,720
how do we be able to uh what happens in

936
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,279
the future

937
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,279
again this is an extrapolation this is

938
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,960
base ideas what we talked about

939
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,559
okay we're going to build it up and

940
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,279
about the fact that uh there is a

941
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,879
possibility of

942
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,640
making relations of different uh

943
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,039
organizations and then we're going to

944
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,840
bring it over and then we talked about

945
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,399
uh

946
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,279
leakage of databases and we're able to

947
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,760
get

948
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,640
craft that email really well phishing so

949
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,360
i'm still on

950
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,159
about phishing to be able to get that

951
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,559
click

952
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:42,799
so increase the database that you've got

953
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,678
well there's lots of database you can

954
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:47,120
have

955
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,720
this one's still available you know um

956
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,879
it's still a whole stack of them you

957
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,279
know there's databases you can start

958
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:55,200
from a base from 2017 stuff

959
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,960
okay there's anti-collection that you

960
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,960
can have not that i'm telling you that

961
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:02,559
you should do this

962
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,480
i'm just saying that it's out there and

963
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,678
don't be surprised of the extrapolation

964
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,840
we're going to be doing

965
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:09,120
okay there's different types of things

966
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,480
that you've got you've got increased

967
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,719
databases

968
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:13,640
you've got different things that are

969
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:17,200
coming

970
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:19,519
online all the time corporate leaks

971
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,399
mix of individuals in those files

972
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:25,559
perhaps there's

973
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:28,879
hr.zip hr1.zip

974
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:30,879
hr2.zip people organization

975
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,000
what they do perhaps there's email

976
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,840
traces

977
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,480
oh that's nice that's great so i can do

978
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:39,918
income in person conversation

979
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:43,039
that is a goldmine even if it's soft id

980
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:45,600
it's a gold mine and you know what

981
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:46,879
maze they're in the business they're in

982
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,519
the business of saying like

983
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:51,120
hey hang on down all the way down to the

984
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,559
ransomware

985
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,199
give us some money or we'll release your

986
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:56,799
information and here's the hard part

987
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,919
to think about what do you do do you

988
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:01,918
paid or do you not pay

989
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:03,600
here's the thing is the tree diagram you

990
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,440
get done because of fishing

991
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,799
ransomware it gets all through here and

992
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,600
what you need to do is you need to

993
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:11,519
either choose

994
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:15,279
to pay which is highly recommended

995
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:18,720
not to but this is the other thing

996
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:20,880
if you don't pay they release the data

997
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,279
for a certain organization which is in

998
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,600
logistics this is the fifth

999
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:26,799
set that has been released on 13th of

1000
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,158
september

1001
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:31,918
okay so what they do is they they

1002
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,440
release the information and then guess

1003
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:36,159
what you can then start

1004
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,880
that it's available publicly and people

1005
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,000
start

1006
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:42,720
getting information crafting emails

1007
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:44,720
and making those emails more believable

1008
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,480
for that click

1009
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,919
it's a lose-lose situation isn't it

1010
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:51,440
unless we band together

1011
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:54,720
and try to be heroes as well

1012
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:57,200
okay only related in thought okay the

1013
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,399
two particular piece of information i

1014
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:01,840
provide

1015
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,879
okay idb okay and the fact that there's

1016
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:05,120
another organization

1017
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,399
that we seem to have forgotten no script

1018
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,359
only one particular

1019
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:10,719
uh social media item there's one where

1020
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:13,918
they've made databases

1021
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:16,480
made available and please contact

1022
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,520
such and such for a demo and the sample

1023
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,918
data

1024
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:21,679
so it sounds like they were selling this

1025
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:23,118
character database what kind of person

1026
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,679
they are perhaps they're going to spread

1027
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:26,720
things

1028
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,079
okay institutional library

1029
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,239
information database and relation

1030
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:33,440
database all this is to be able to

1031
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:35,678
understand who when how why

1032
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,480
for someone who wants to make fishing

1033
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,159
perfect

1034
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,000
i'd love to be able to know that i'd

1035
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,200
love to be able to know all of this and

1036
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:44,399
amass it

1037
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:47,359
what i'm trying to get at is

1038
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:48,879
perhaps companies are doing this and

1039
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:51,440
perhaps all the database

1040
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,319
are available to be able to do this so

1041
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,679
what i can

1042
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:56,000
see is that things are going to get

1043
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,399
worse what else is ransomware do you

1044
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,720
know how

1045
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:00,160
i talk about the double double quarter

1046
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,879
pounder with cheeseburger well guess

1047
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:03,359
what you know what

1048
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:05,440
at the end it was uh ransomware well

1049
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:08,000
cerberus banking trojan

1050
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:08,640
they're sending the code out apparently

1051
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,280
um

1052
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,160
and for all of these banks okay it's

1053
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,880
available

1054
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,279
have a look at it zd net and then you'll

1055
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:18,880
find

1056
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:21,040
on pastebin as well so there's a whole

1057
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:26,800
lot of things that are happening

1058
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:29,759
fish is not just fishing it's nasty

1059
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:31,040
so here we go i rejected rally and

1060
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,160
substitute my own i'm going to go a

1061
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,279
little bit further on

1062
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:35,920
i'm going to distort it a little bit

1063
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,560
more and i'm going to go extend beyond a

1064
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,920
little bit

1065
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:41,599
okay and um so

1066
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:43,440
what i'm going to be talking about is

1067
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:46,800
perhaps this

1068
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,480
perhaps or um if we are if they're able

1069
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,520
to organize themselves so much

1070
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,880
let's say uh new south wales doesn't

1071
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,000
like very much for queensland

1072
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,599
we'll just talk about something which is

1073
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,720
internal in australia perhaps well

1074
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,880
perhaps perhaps and

1075
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,799
we like each other really it's okay but

1076
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:03,440
this is again beyond reality

1077
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:05,200
um and they are they are really don't

1078
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,800
like the fact that uh queensland is on

1079
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,759
his feet perhaps and uh

1080
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,640
are wanting to do some uh some attack

1081
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,960
and try to

1082
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,680
get money out of it so they send fish

1083
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,240
again

1084
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,598
and they concentrate pretty much on one

1085
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,240
locality

1086
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,960
well the locality has two options either

1087
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,000
pay up

1088
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:27,040
or get their information dispersed which

1089
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,720
then helps to other people to get in

1090
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,440
their organization and then ask them to

1091
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,799
pay up

1092
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,960
and that effect is there's going to be a

1093
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:35,119
payment and there's going to be a shift

1094
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:37,920
of wealth

1095
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,560
that could be a bit of a problem that's

1096
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,040
just a

1097
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:43,279
really extrapolation anyway however it

1098
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:46,400
applies to you that's up to you

1099
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:47,599
but eyes on prize you know what fish at

1100
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,200
the start

1101
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,040
it's only the beginning and yes i've

1102
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,720
ripped off that particular item

1103
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,839
okay but really business email

1104
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,319
compromise is only the start of the

1105
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:56,640
journey

1106
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,079
and i've used almost verbatim from a

1107
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,520
person that takes and makes

1108
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:03,680
shell okay um but what we need to know

1109
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,040
is that we can all be heroes

1110
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,078
we can all figure out hey hang on we got

1111
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,680
a purpose

1112
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:11,359
this is not something that we need to

1113
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,799
brush off this is something that is

1114
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:16,240
really really important that we take

1115
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:18,079
care of because here's the vicious cycle

1116
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,759
it comes to rest and where we need to

1117
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:21,359
pay up if we don't pay up

1118
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,960
our information goes out there if

1119
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,480
animation goes out there

1120
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:26,160
then it's something that people can pick

1121
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:29,520
up to be able to then

1122
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,520
further attacks either on yourself or

1123
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,200
on other organizations that are

1124
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,280
interacting with you

1125
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,240
so it's really important we can be

1126
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,560
heroes

1127
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:40,160
it is a bit dangerous to empower every

1128
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,440
user to do it perhaps they'll spend a

1129
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,520
bit too much time perhaps it will

1130
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:44,960
it is a bit of scary to be able to say

1131
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,440
look we're going to give a prize for how

1132
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,680
many people

1133
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,800
actually report a fish because perhaps

1134
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,399
they're going to spend their time

1135
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,839
but we need to be able to take that risk

1136
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,320
to be able to choose the superpower that

1137
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:55,920
we can

1138
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:57,920
find and all be heroes we can be heroes

1139
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,359
if i would like to be able to open the

1140
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:04,880
floor to any questions

1141
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:07,598
that'd be fantastic

1142
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,720
cool all right i'm on just a little bit

1143
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,800
of lag with the

1144
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,040
platform thank you thank you so much

1145
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,040
jeff

1146
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:20,800
yes totally yummy

1147
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:22,800
great technology is very difficult

1148
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,800
right so thank you so much for that jeff

1149
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,640
and i'll just like to say

1150
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,079
as melbourne i think we should be

1151
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,759
launching a targeted phishing attack

1152
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,520
against queensland

1153
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,400
we're ready i'm very very sure that also

1154
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:37,759
will pick me up

1155
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,480
in a heartbeat um there were some really

1156
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,560
really good

1157
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:41,599
takeaways there thank you so much for

1158
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,359
for sharing that

1159
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:45,359
and i'm definitely gonna have a whole

1160
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:48,160
lot of this uh keep a hold of the

1161
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:48,560
of the slides there um there weren't too

1162
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,759
many

1163
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,560
actually there weren't any questions in

1164
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,839
the chat however

1165
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:57,279
yes um one thing i would like to do is

1166
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:58,078
for everyone in the chat that's still in

1167
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,520
here

1168
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:04,960
is to say thank you to ozer for being

1169
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:05,759
absolute our heroes and throughout the

1170
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,760
year

1171
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,040
and i want to say from the bottom of my

1172
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,680
heart honestly

1173
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,480
thank you very much assert um what you

1174
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,480
guys do in

1175
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:17,280
industry is absolutely second to none so

1176
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:17,280
i want to say thank you

1177
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:25,760
one question in there what is inventions

1178
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,079
for doing efficient campaigns for

1179
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,680
doing a fishing campaign uh you mean you

1180
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,880
really want to get to an

1181
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,359
action or you want to teach your users

1182
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,000
something

1183
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,960
um suppose you're trying to say teaching

1184
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,440
your users something

1185
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:43,280
well well i i would hope you imagine

1186
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,720
that that may not be the best thing to

1187
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,240
do why be

1188
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,240
again these other ideas i'd like to be

1189
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,359
able to share not particularly your view

1190
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,078
of an organization

1191
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:53,839
just think about it um if you do that

1192
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,320
you're going to desensitize people

1193
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,960
in about the fishing okay you're also

1194
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,000
have to

1195
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,800
tell them so what is

1196
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:04,480
my recommendation is you spend more time

1197
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,160
on the monitoring you spend more time

1198
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:08,720
and your resources on that

1199
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,240
and provide a monthly report because

1200
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,078
people have leaky memories

1201
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,520
about whether there's a policy whether

1202
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,400
it's to use awareness you need to be

1203
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,040
able to be there

1204
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,800
so if you want to campaign make the

1205
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,079
campaign of reporting all the time

1206
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,079
about what's happening in the

1207
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:24,079
organization where you've stopped it

1208
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,200
makes the idea look good where you

1209
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:27,280
weren't able to stop

1210
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,359
it and the users were able to stop it

1211
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,000
that makes the users look good

1212
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:33,680
where you weren't able to stop it at all

1213
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,480
and then the incident responders were

1214
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,319
able to then

1215
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,400
take care of it that makes the incident

1216
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:39,920
responders look really good okay

1217
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,280
and then to be able to then make

1218
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:45,040
everybody in the organization the hero

1219
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,240
thank you very much so we'll have to

1220
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,520
wrap it up there because we're a little

1221
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:50,479
bit short on time

1222
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,040
but um i thank you again very much the

1223
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,839
offset

1224
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,839
so that concludes

1225
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,759
sick and tired of hearing my voice like

1226
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,279

1228
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,079
longer speaking for the rest of the day

1229
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:07,119
but we will be coming back at 2 25 for

1230
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,440
the speed debate

1231
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,440

1232
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,520

1233
