1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:07,359
but um so without any further ado

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:09,360
uh i'll turn it over to david ruddock

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,000
with his presentation on prepare for a

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,000
data breach

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,000
thanks um thank you very much uh

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,000
so just uh my topic today is yeah how to

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,480
prepare your smaller midsize business

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,198
um for a data breach on a budget uh the

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,439
reason

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,679
for this is uh you know six years ago

11
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:32,238
when i started coming to osert

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,680
i didn't know as much i'm still a

13
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,199
beginner but i know a lot more than i

14
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,200
did then and it made me realize there's

15
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,520
a lot of other people out there who

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,719
they don't know what you don't know and

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,879
it often ends up getting you into

18
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,120
trouble so our goal is to uh

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,919
to try and um maybe give some

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,960
foundations

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,520
for those people who are sort of

22
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,199
starting out in the industry and uh

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,280
because the number of incidents is

24
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,199
increasing um

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,480
as mentioned i really liking interaction

26
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,320
and engagement um

27
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,559
and because i can't see you uh if you

28
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,640
would enter your questions into the q a

29
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,600
box as we go i'll do my best

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,159
um to answer them just a little bit

31
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,640
about me

32
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,760

43
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,840
and more recently a gx certified

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,320
forensic examiner and forensic

45
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:37,200
analyst a little bit about my company

46
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,720
about two years ago we were engaged by

47
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,520
cfc underwriting which are one of the

48
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,560
big

49
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,200
cyber insurers uh to provide they're

50
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,600
insured

51
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,439
with incident response digital forensics

52
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,479
data cataloging services

53
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,839
uh and to

54
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,000
their they're insured so i was reading

55
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,360
the q a at the same time so

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,759
what this has done for us is really

57
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,200
provide us with first-hand knowledge

58
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,000
of the type of things that lead to an

59
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,880
incident

60
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
and also the typical challenges that

61
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,799
occur

62
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,318
uh you know when an incident occurs um

63
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,920
and for campbell yeah i'm more than

64
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:13,839
happy to provide a copy of the slides

65
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,359
i'll leave my contact details at the end

66
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,080
and i'll also give them to the oscert

67
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,239
guys

68
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,760
um the screen i've got on at the moment

69
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,560
i i kind of like because my little

70
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,560
company

71
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,480
uh which up until recently had about

72
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,440
eight staff we've now got about 20

73
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,920
uh is pictured here with the likes of uh

74
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,840
crowdstrike kpmg and symantec and i

75
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,200
think that's kind of um

76
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:38,000
a big uh call of fame for us as a tiny

77
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,200
little gold coast business

78
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,720
so just to set the scene let's look at a

79
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,879
typical incident response scenario

80
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,400
uh first of all business notices that

81
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,760
they're having some it issues

82
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:55,200
and they give the help desk a call

83
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,679
the it team begins investigation and the

84
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,079
team discovers that servers or a user's

85
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:02,319
mailbox has been compromised

86
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,640
the team continues to investigate and

87
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,079
discovers they've had a cyber incident

88
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,760
so the business calls the insurance

89
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,080
broker the insurance broker

90
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,440
lodges the cyber insurance claim and the

91
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,000
insurer then

92
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,720
responds and inside assigns an incident

93
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,720
response team

94
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,159
and this is typically where things go

95
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,680
really well

96
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,720
or really badly the ir team typically

97
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,000
will come in and find

98
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,519
very little logging is enabled and uh

99
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,040
funnily enough murray's presentation

100
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,720
before me was talking about you know

101
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,480
getting more telemetry out of the

102
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,599
logging and making sure you're logging

103
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,518
the right things

104
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,959
what we often find just trying to do

105
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,720
incident response is

106
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:42,239
uh either the logs have been blown away

107
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,200
or they were set at the very bare

108
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,959
minimum

109
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:49,200
um and there's really not a lot to go on

110
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,799
we also find the threat actor has been

111
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,480
in the system for a considerable amount

112
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,000
of time

113
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,920
and in performing their own

114
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,439
investigations the it team have kind of

115
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,200
left their own footprints

116
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,879
all over the digital crime scene and so

117
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,518
now we've got a problem where

118
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,798
we've got to try and discern between

119
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,280
what is actually

120
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,280
the threat actor activity and what is

121
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,360
you know regular activity

122
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,879
post-incident this leads to a series of

123
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,639
unfortunate events

124
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,159
uh the forensic investigators are

125
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:19,040
therefore unable to confidently

126
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,560
determine

127
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,400
whether the threat actor gained access

128
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,360
to any sensitive personally identifiable

129
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,000
information

130
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,440
and or personal health information and

131
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,560
then the business

132
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,320
uh has to notify under the uh notifiable

133
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,840
data breach legislation which is not a

134
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,599
position we really want every business

135
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,159
to end up in it's

136
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,280
it's uh it can be avoidable and today

137
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,199
i'm going to try and take you through a

138
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,599
couple of things to try and help you

139
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,199
position yourself so that if and when

140
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,680
you have an incident

141
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,040
you'll be in the best position to to

142
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,040
walk through that investigation and

143
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:54,080
hopefully come out the other side with a

144
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,560
fairly confident result

145
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,400
so what can you do first of all and it

146
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,840
seems so simple but create a cyber

147
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,280
incident response plan

148
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,479
and i i was talking to uh the uh the

149
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,799
guys from oscer

150
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,320
and also the acsc uh on the various

151
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,919
slack channels prior to this

152
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,520
there's a lot of good resources online

153
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,159
to give you a

154
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,440
boilerplate starting position uh

155
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,039
victorian government has one the

156
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,039
queensland government has one

157
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,039
and actually a lot of cyber insurers

158
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,840
will offer templates so

159
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,320
there's really no excuse not to have

160
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,560
something

161
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,840
bottom line keep it simple list out who

162
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,680
your primary contacts are

163
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,280
vendors and their responsibilities make

164
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,520
sure everyone understands it

165
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,960
and then run a tabletop exercise at

166
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,198
least once a year so that people

167
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,719
actually have to go through a scenario

168
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,800
where they're experiencing an incident

169
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,160
and i know ben demarco and steph lurz

170
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,880
went through a really good one the other

171
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,840
day

172
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,960
um there's people you can engage to do

173
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,960
those and it'll just

174
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,080
kind of like a fire drill get you into

175
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,080
the habit of of

176
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,960
knowing the actions you should take if

177
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,960
you have an incident

178
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,479
so there's two scenarios that i really

179
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,119
want you to focus on and

180
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,080
the number one type of or not two top

181
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,360
incidents that we

182
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,318
see that result in a cyber claim

183
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,919
uh and as a result of data breach the

184
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,360
first one which i'm sure everyone here

185
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,359
has talked about is business email

186
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,319
compromise and this can happen through

187
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,199
phishing

188
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,319
um through password stuffing uh or a

189
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:25,520
whole range of different ways

190
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,360
legacy protocols but it is probably the

191
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,680
most prevalent

192
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,680
cyber incident that we investigate and

193
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,840
the second one is ransomware

194
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,520
and even though we deal with a lot of it

195
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,840
providers when we go in to do our um

196
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,639
incident response and they're all

197
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,239
focused

198
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,960
on the rants and we're coming through

199
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,759
via email these days ransomware comes in

200
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,120
because people left the door open uh and

201
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,960
i know there was another presentation

202
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,360
earlier where they were talking about

203
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,599
you know the change in the landscape as

204
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,039
a byproduct of covert 19

205
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,800
and and that's really true some of the

206
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:59,120
big incidents we worked on

207
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,440
post everyone going into iso were

208
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,400
because businesses had to move really

209
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,280
quickly

210
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,840
to enable their workforce to go remote

211
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,520
and

212
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,560
they would stand up remote desktop

213
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:13,039
servers and not securely lock them down

214
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:17,759
and as a byproduct you know users have

215
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:20,800
basic passwords and and they get popped

216
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,880
with your response plan as well we i

217
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,919
cannot stress enough about how important

218
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,080
it is that

219
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,840
before you start your investigation or

220
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,080
if when you get into your investigation

221
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,479
you realize it's a cyber incident

222
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,919
try if possible to make a backup of the

223
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,758
system that you're looking at before you

224
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,000
go too far

225
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,000
if you do this then at least you've got

226
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,520
as close as near to

227
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,280
the incident as possible for the

228
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,599
investigators to look at um

229
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,520
quite often you know we will find that

230
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,280
the whole system has been encrypted

231
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,878
but because there's a backup taken every

232
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,559
hour and it was taken just before the

233
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,840
system was encrypted we've got something

234
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,039
to go back to

235
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,878
um this takes time and there are ways to

236
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,080
do it uh which other presenters have

237
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,039
talked about

238
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,318
and there's a lot of really good

239
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,560
resources out there and i'm happy to

240
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:07,759
share a couple of others if anyone um

241
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,240
pings me on it the other thing is too

242
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,240
and and this is probably um teaching

243
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,080
some people here how to suck eggs but

244
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,080
don't rush to pull the plug the old

245
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,599
mentality and we still face it with it

246
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,639
support companies managed service

247
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,479
providers is

248
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,160
this rush to oh my god we've had an

249
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,719
incident pull the plug on those systems

250
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,599
before

251
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,639
it spreads too far and what we've you

252
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,878
know what we all learn

253
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,759
over time is that if you do that you may

254
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,039
actually

255
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,800
first of all you can't investigate

256
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,958
things properly um

257
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,319
because you've stopped it midway and

258
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:38,000
second of all there may be something in

259
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,839
memory that you've just lost

260
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,519
and yes there are forensic artifacts

261
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,240
that store parts of things in

262
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,880
in files uh parts of memory and files

263
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,120
but

264
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,640
if that system's still online um we've

265
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,760
got a better chance of pulling out the

266
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,720
full memory and

267
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,720
investigating it

268
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,560
and uh also saying going on with what

269
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,120
murray was talking about dial up your

270
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,399
logging

271
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,000
um you know one of the biggest things we

272
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,200
found in office 365

273
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,200
is that um

274
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,040
yes thomas i would say yank the nick

275
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,959
instead in some instances

276
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,880
um but yeah coming back to the the

277
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,640
slides dial up your logging uh

278
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,720
ensure the unified audit log is enabled

279
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,959
for office 365. the amount of times

280
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,040
we've gone in for an investigation

281
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,160
for an office 365 business email

282
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,160
compromise

283
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,920
and the unified audit log isn't enabled

284
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,600
and without that

285
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,120
you've lost half of the information to

286
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,720
be able to perform an investigation you

287
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:33,839
cannot tell

288
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,720
how the threat actor gained access

289
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,720
to the mailbox what actions they

290
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,640
performed what was the method of access

291
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,680
which a lot of reports we review

292
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,760
of other incidents they don't record

293
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,519
that and it's really important the oaic

294
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,200
really wants to know if you if it's been

295
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,519
accessed by imap because you've left a

296
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,800
legacy protocol open

297
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,880
that's really important because it could

298
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,079
mean that the mailbox was potentially

299
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,160
synchronized

300
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:02,480
there's a really good tool called log md

301
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,680
that will do in its free version an

302
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,399
audit of your windows service security

303
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:10,079
and logging baselines and it'll baseline

304
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,880
it against

305
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:14,719
nist and the asc essential 8 and all the

306
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,480
rest of it and give you an evaluation of

307
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,000
what you should turn on

308
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,000
you can go further with it and we'll

309
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,760
create a some actually good forensic

310
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,200
information as well but the free version

311
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,200
is great and it will just give you a

312
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,480
really good starting point to work out

313
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,240
what do you need to change in your

314
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,760
environment

315
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,440
and then the final thing on that with

316
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,000
your logging is is make sure that the

317
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,440
at least the windows security log is

318
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,399
sitting at 2gig

319
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,320
uh in previous versions of windows the

320
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,839
windows logging the bigger it was the

321
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,360
more memory it consumed

322
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,959
that hasn't been the case for a very

323
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,800
long time it's

324
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,399
um you know people still believe that's

325
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,319
the case but turn it up as big as you

326
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,399
can because as much logging data that is

327
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,440
available in the system itself is really

328
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,640
really useful

329
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,079
uh for for a forensic purpose

330
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,240
obviously if the threat actor has gone

331
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,319
in and reset the logs that doesn't help

332
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,519
most threat actors will go in and delete

333
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,120
the volume

334
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,320
shadow copies but if there is something

335
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,680
there at least we've

336
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,440
you know we can deep dive into that

337
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,800
the other thing is as well because they

338
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,720
will reset the logs

339
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,160
um is implement some form of log

340
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,880
collection and it doesn't have to be a

341
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,480
full-blown

342
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:24,079
seam um i would uh

343
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,640
i would i would hazard that even

344
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,560
something as simple as elasticsearch

345
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,720
can be leveraged as a really good

346
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,560
low-cost log collection solution

347
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,760
keep it on a separate system and aim for

348
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,518
12 months worth of

349
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,880
log collection for your firewall servers

350
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,160
and other key devices

351
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:41,120
and again there's some really good

352
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,199
resources which i'm happy to share which

353
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,279
you know will teach you what

354
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,959
specifically to monitor for like the

355
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,079
certain event types that you really want

356
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,638
to look for the

357
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,638
log on to system log off from system um

358
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,120
administrative privileges used

359
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,160
changes to active directory it's all

360
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,720
there in the in

361
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,199
the public domain it's just that most

362
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,200
people

363
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,880
aren't using it and if you want to go

364
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,240
all out and implement a full-on scene

365
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,079
that's great but again we're talking

366
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,880
about doing this on a budget and you can

367
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,560
do this for

368
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:14,079
for next to nics

369
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,880
and always secure the end user um

370
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,160
this is such a silly thing to be having

371
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,320
to be say but

372
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,079
um you know we log into some websites

373
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,760
and they don't allow us still in this

374
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,279
day and age to have passwords longer

375
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,279
than eight characters

376
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:31,279
um we encourage not to have regular

377
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:34,720
password resets i know there's

378
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:36,880
a constant flip flap on this one but

379
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,480
uh you know a friend of mine when she

380
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,439
started working for us she came from

381
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,760
travel

382
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,519
her original password was holiday one

383
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,200
then when it got rotated

384
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,600
uh it was holiday two and then it was

385
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,519
holiday three and so on and so forth and

386
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,639
if you force people to constantly change

387
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,839
their passwords

388
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,200
they're gonna get tired and they're

389
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,800
going to make it really simple for them

390
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,920
because passwords are hard

391
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,599
um love password managers some banks

392
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,160
don't love password managers

393
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,279
um but that's one way of really ensuring

394
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,399
that you are

395
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,639
helping your team to better their

396
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,760
standards

397
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,760
and of course multi-factor

398
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,920
authentication and again i've heard a

399
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,120
lot of presenters today talk about

400
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,360
you know when they were doing red

401
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,680
teaming exercises that had multi-factor

402
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,279
authentication being implemented or

403
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,680
configured properly they probably

404
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:26,959
wouldn't have gotten as far as they did

405
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,880
we get a lot of pushback from insureds

406
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,599
when we we go into an incident

407
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,839
particularly when it's an office 365

408
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,279
mailbox compromise and we say to them

409
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,360
okay well you need to go

410
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,959
and immediately enable multi-factor

411
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,160
authentication and

412
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:43,680
quite often the scenario we get back is

413
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,519
well we're actually in the middle of an

414
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,040
evaluation of that

415
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,800
and there's a pilot group of people who

416
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,319
are testing it out but

417
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,920
we're getting a lot of pushback from

418
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,240
from our end users because they don't

419
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,040
want an

420
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,600
application installed on their phone and

421
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,399
it

422
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,959
it's such a painless experience now to

423
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,519
install

424
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,560
think something like the microsoft

425
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:04,800
authenticator

426
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,399
it's i was talking to one of the big

427
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,639
insurers the other night and they said

428
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,320
they have statistics that prove

429
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,199
if multi-factor authentication was

430
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,560
enabled on office 365 mailboxes

431
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,240
the number of claims would go

432
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,518
significantly down

433
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,240
um it's it's such a brainless thing but

434
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,399
still we're doing investigations where

435
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,920
very large prominent organizations

436
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:27,120
don't have multi-factor authentication

437
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,719
on and even if it's just they're

438
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,560
high-risk users

439
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:32,480
people who are you know dealing with

440
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,560
finances or

441
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,160
keeping copies of of highly sensitive

442
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,518
information um

443
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,120
and yet they still don't turn it on

444
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:42,000
because the user feels that it's it's

445
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:42,000
not frictionless

446
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:46,479
um and of course empower the users like

447
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,720
the the it department has typically

448
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,560
and i come from the i.t world has

449
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:55,760
typically been the department of no

450
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:57,199
and so users have been berated

451
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,040
every time they sort of say hey is this

452
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,920
this and this is that

453
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,439
by the it team and we want to get into a

454
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,360
a world where we actually encourage

455
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,680
people to come to you and say hey

456
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,600
i just got this before i click on it can

457
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,880
you check that it's okay

458
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,720
one of the things we did with a lot of

459
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,839
our clients is um

460
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,160
we actually started sending them

461
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,639
chocolate bars and

462
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,319
everyone likes chocolate and what we

463
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,680
would say to them is if you sent us a

464
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,920
phishing email

465
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,599
that legitimately had was a fishing

466
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,680
email we would send you a chocolate bar

467
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:30,959
and a chocolate bar cost two bucks

468
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,000
um but as a byproduct we we didn't have

469
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,399
to go into

470
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,320
you know helping them whether it was a

471
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,040
virus or you know male box compromise

472
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,839
and all this is

473
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,519
five ten years ago and it significantly

474
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:43,199
reduced the number of incidents that

475
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:48,079
we're having because people were

476
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:48,079
motivated to um to get the chocolate bar

477
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,839
and uh

478
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,880
really good question paul um i haven't

479
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,560
done any research uh the question is

480
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,079
have you done any research on password

481
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,079
length tolerability

482
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,920
on the part of end users from a cost to

483
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,040
crack perspective 12 characters is way

484
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,399
too low nowadays

485
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:14,399
yeah look it is um the we always try and

486
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,600
encourage people to use a passphrase um

487
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,160
obviously a new

488
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,320
unique one for every single system um

489
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,439
but if multi-factor is also tied to it

490
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,759
and you don't have things like

491
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,040
legacy protocols enabled so pop3 imap

492
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,600
and everything has to go through a

493
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:33,279
modern authenticator then

494
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,519
uh the the

495
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,199
the chance of a 12 digit pass getting

496
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,440
popped is a lot less

497
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,719
i guess the problem is a lot of people

498
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,399
have been allowed to get away with four

499
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,839
and six-digit passwords and and we just

500
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,560
want to keep raising the bar up we don't

501
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:47,120
want to set the bar

502
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,239
so high no one can attain it we want to

503
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,320
start

504
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,160
just chipping away at that bar and and

505
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,959
making it more difficult for the the

506
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,959
cyber criminals

507
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,800
so uh as i said as well secure remote

508
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,560
access um

509
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,839
everything either needs to be behind an

510
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,280
ssl vpn

511
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:08,959
uh we repeatedly

512
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:10,959
end up in a debate with it providers

513
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,319
who when we get into involved in it do

514
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:14,400
you guys have remote desktop

515
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,720
open oh yes we do but we've got it

516
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,640
running on a non-standard port and as

517
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,640
some of the people in the room are aware

518
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,240
i'm sure there's so many open source

519
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,240
tools out there that you can use that

520
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,199
will identify

521
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,919
what every port is and finding remote

522
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,840
desk at

523
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,360
desktop these days is trivial plus you

524
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,199
can go to showdown and it's probably

525
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,719
listed anyway

526
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,160
so just using you know the old security

527
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,760
through obscurity

528
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,760
is only fooling yourself

529
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,480
talking about the legacy protocols uh

530
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,480
inside office 365 there is an option

531
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,559
which can be done globally on a per

532
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,559
mailbox basis

533
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,960
pop an imap which for those that don't

534
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,720
know is an old way of accessing your

535
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,720
emails pop3 was sort of a bucket

536
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,200
situation

537
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,400
imap is a little bit more intelligent in

538
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,320
that it was designed for

539
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,080
synchronization between multiple devices

540
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,480
before we ended up with what we have now

541
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,840
but they're enabled by default and these

542
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,919
things don't support

543
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,600
multi-factor authentication and quite

544
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,720
often when we do an investigation into

545
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,520
an office 365 mailbox compromise

546
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:20,880
the threat actor will move to using imap

547
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,400
to access the mailbox

548
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,000
and as i said at the start um

549
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,559
that means that the threat actor has

550
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,760
potentially synchronized part or all of

551
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,440
the mailbox

552
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:35,120
and as it stands currently office 365

553
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,799
does not log

554
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,879
what part of the mailbox they actually

555
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,400
downloaded so you've sort of got this

556
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,320
throw your hands in the air situation

557
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,760
where all we know is they could have

558
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,639
potentially synchronized it we just

559
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,600
don't know

560
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:49,360
how many uh which of the native windows

561
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,039
vpn options would you recommend

562
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,600
to be honest um i always go for

563
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:57,440
something that's ssl vpn based which is

564
00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:01,360
the open source open vpn a lot of

565
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:04,880
uh commercial firewalls support

566
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:07,120
that as a basic um

567
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,960
sometimes you have to license it some of

568
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,080
the more high-end firewalls have their

569
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,559
own version

570
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,080
but you know if you go buy i won't

571
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,559
mention brands but most of them out

572
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:20,399
there will have support for ssl vpn

573
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:22,879
and uh yeah i'd head in that direction

574
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,960
what is the replacement for imap if you

575
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:28,000
if you haven't moved to office 365

576
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,880
or something like google g suite um you

577
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,520
need to

578
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,799
and the replacement is generally it's a

579
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:38,160
web-based synchronization so it's https

580
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:41,360
uh and you know office 365

581
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,799
and google g suite use that natively if

582
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,399
you're using office 365

583
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:50,320
with um outlook then it will uh it will

584
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:52,240
use https um as opposed to imap

585
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,320
but yeah they really should be very few

586
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,919
reasons to continue using imap unless

587
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,039
you've got some legacy

588
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:03,039
uh contact relation management system um

589
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:03,039
then i'd be turning it off globally

590
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,360
the other thing too um put your vendors

591
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:10,480
on notice

592
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,760
uh we're finding a lot when we go into

593
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,919
engagements that

594
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,120
you know the a certain vendor of a

595
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:18,640
particular

596
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,520
uh provi a particular client uh has

597
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,799
essentially been

598
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,679
responsible for putting the client at

599
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,440
risk

600
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,000
uh you know we deal with a lot of uh

601
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,640
third-party software vendors who

602
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,200
because and not no offense to everyone

603
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,760
out there but

604
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,480
some software guys think that they know

605
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,559
everything about

606
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,600
it and networking and technology and so

607
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:40,799
they'll encourage

608
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,639
clients to enable rdp and they won't do

609
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,760
it with ip white listing or any sort of

610
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,200
protections

611
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,879
and the client doesn't know any better

612
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,400
they just assume that these people are

613
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,880
professional um

614
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,320
and and they'll do what the provider

615
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,880
says

616
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,000
the other thing is too you know what

617
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,360
happens if

618
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,520
uh how are they protecting you from a

619
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,158
cyber attack

620
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,960
you know specifically we had an incident

621
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,200
with uh

622
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:08,720
with a piece of software that uh was

623
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,919
modified

624
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,960
to change the banking details of a of

625
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,880
you know someone that they were going to

626
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,400
pay and when we went to do the

627
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,360
investigation we went to the vendor and

628
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,159
said hey

629
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,479
um does your application log homemade

630
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:24,799
changes to that part of the system

631
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,400
and their answer was well only if it's

632
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,600
turned on and we sat there and thought

633
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,559
that that should be something that's on

634
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,918
by default

635
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,600
and then we get to the other end of the

636
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,200
scale where we also have vendors who

637
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:35,280
tell us no we don't we don't have some

638
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,840
sort of transactional or audit log in

639
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:38,480
our

640
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,678
and our software and you as the consumer

641
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,440
need to really

642
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,440
put pressure on the vendors and say well

643
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,799
you know what are you doing to help us

644
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,559
because at some stage something will

645
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:48,799
happen

646
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,960
another one we dealt with uh whenever

647
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:52,720
you walk into the rsl clubs or a lot of

648
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,480
those clubs and they scan your driver's

649
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,280
license or

650
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,600
you know how is that stored and up until

651
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,440
recently it wasn't stored in a very

652
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,719
safe and secure way in fact one

653
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,000
engagement we had

654
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,520
we asked them and they said oh it's

655
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,720
stored on the client server and we went

656
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,559
to this client and said well

657
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,640
do you know what it's on and they said

658
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,799
no it was just installed for us

659
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,799
and what had happened is the the vendor

660
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,440
had gone and just mapped a share on it

661
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,280
on a

662
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:19,760
on a drive and essentially was storing

663
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,240
these files um

664
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,960
yeah on the system now if that system

665
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,039
got

666
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,559
hacked it just it had copies of people's

667
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,158
driver's license all over it and there

668
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,360
was just sort of a

669
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,880
you know pointing the finger in each way

670
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,039
the other thing too is like does that

671
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,720
software if it stores sensitive pii or

672
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:39,039
phi enforce

673
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,000
mfa and a lot of the accounting software

674
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,640
is doing that now which

675
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,840
is great um but there's still a lot of

676
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,080
applications out there that

677
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:47,678
don't and and this needs to be a bare

678
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:49,439
minimum and the final thing with the

679
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,320
vendors on that aspect is

680
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,039
do they get an independent penetration

681
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,720
test

682
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,080
performed on their softwares

683
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,320
particularly if it's web

684
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,158
facing uh there's been a lot of

685
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:03,039
incidents with schools and and

686
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:04,320
a few other groups at the moment and the

687
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,919
question is you know

688
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,520
are they actually testing the code or is

689
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,720
it just something that

690
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,720
you know they've put together and

691
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,039
they're hoping for the best and

692
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:16,240
a lot of vendors are really really shy

693
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:16,240
to answer this question

694
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,520
another thing we see a lot as well is uh

695
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,679
you know the managed service provider a

696
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,000
managed security service provider

697
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,440
do they enforce multi-factor

698
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,640
authentication

699
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,080
when their staff access your system via

700
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,480
remote support

701
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,280
so things like teamviewer screen connect

702
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,240
splashtop

703
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:37,280
all those sort of things we have seen a

704
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,840
huge number

705
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,480
of incidents where the managed service

706
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,600
provider

707
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,200
got hacked and then as a byproduct the

708
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,000
threat actor was able to leverage their

709
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:49,840
remote support tools to then deploy

710
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,600
ransomware across all of their clients

711
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,840
so instead of just getting one client

712
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,399
they've got 10 or 20 or 100.

713
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,360
um which then is a really interesting

714
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,799
question so

715
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,799
you know does the managed service

716
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,918
provider have a cyber insurance policy

717
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,400
part one

718
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,080
part two if all of their clients were

719
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:07,600
hit with ransomware as a byproduct of

720
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,000
them being compromised

721
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:11,439
would their policy hold up and i'd

722
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,360
hazard that most of them won't have a

723
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:17,120
big enough policy

724
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:19,120
to do that question is

725
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:21,120
is it's worthwhile keeping the remote

726
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,039
worker off the network use of splashtop

727
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,158
teamviewer etc would isolate a remote

728
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:28,158
workers machine

729
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,159
which may be compromised um

730
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,440
yeah i mean if you have a quarantine

731
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,039
vlan or or something you can put the

732
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,120
machine in so that

733
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,480
you know remote work can be done to it

734
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,479
and it is

735
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,760
unable to touch the network that that

736
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,760
would definitely be preferable

737
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:48,480
um it seems silly that we have to see

738
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,919
that say this but

739
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,919
everyone needs to make sure they've got

740
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,240
an automated off-site

741
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,919
backup and we had an incident the other

742
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,720
day really

743
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:00,000
big business um they obviously got hit

744
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,840
with ransomware

745
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,919
and we said them okay well what's your

746
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,520
backup strategy i will we replicate to

747
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:09,279
an offsite location

748
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:11,760
okay well replication isn't backup

749
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:15,840
if you replicate the ransomware system

750
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:18,080
you have a backup of a ransomware system

751
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,959
you need something that looks at and

752
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,199
it's not a one

753
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,960
size fits all either you know certain

754
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,279
parts of data for a business

755
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,720
are more important than another certain

756
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,960
things you could probably

757
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,120
lose and the business can continue to

758
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:33,279
operate whereas there's other things

759
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,239
the business desperately needs and if it

760
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,080
lost them it's in a

761
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:37,360
really bad position and either has to

762
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,918
pay the ransom or

763
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,039
or worse uh and a business needs to sit

764
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,240
down and assess that

765
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,600
with their it person provider and work

766
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,440
out what is the right

767
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,879
strategy for them and make sure it

768
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,960
actually goes off site and it's

769
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,320
automatic

770
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:56,559
and it should allow you as well to

771
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,158
roll back to previous versions too and

772
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,000
that as i said earlier that's become

773
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,919
really useful for us in investigations

774
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,480
having the ability to roll back

775
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,760
to try and determine sometimes just how

776
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,279
long is the threat active being in the

777
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,440
system if we don't have the

778
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,480
you know the the live systems to

779
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,000
investigate because they've been

780
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,919
encrypted at the disk

781
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,440
disk level not the file level the whole

782
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,039
vm the virtual machine has been

783
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,320
encrypted and there's just nothing for

784
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,640
us to look at

785
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,080
um and of course again i shouldn't have

786
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,080
to say this but

787
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,320
if you're not testing your backups

788
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:28,639
they're useless it's kind of like

789
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,720
not having not doing a fire drill you

790
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,159
know people won't know what to do when

791
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,400
it happens

792
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,400
um

793
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,559
yeah when you do the pull the nick the

794
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,000
initial analysis

795
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,600
take time and things are not obvious

796
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,120
until you go in and look you create

797
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,719
fatigue if you cry wolf every time you

798
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,719
see something funny of course you do

799
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:49,840
um but there's going to be a small step

800
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,960
where you do a little bit of an

801
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,120
investigation

802
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,320
and i would there's going to be certain

803
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,158
incidents and this is something you have

804
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:57,678
to work into your incident response plan

805
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,360
and whatever consultant you're working

806
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:02,720
at where

807
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:05,600
you know some pull the network cable out

808
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,440
is acceptable um other things might be

809
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:09,039
an a temporary isolation into an

810
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,480
isolation network so it can continue to

811
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,879
be investigated without

812
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,320
impact to the operation other things

813
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,679
might be just leave it until someone can

814
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,399
look at it

815
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,000
but uh you know it is different ways to

816
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:24,639
approach every situation it's not

817
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,480
as not a one-size-fits-all

818
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,000
and the last one is get cyber insurance

819
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,200
the number of businesses i talk to

820
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,600
because we do a lot of speaking

821
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,000
engagements for insurance brokers

822
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,520
and these businesses they're still not

823
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,880
getting cyber insurance and i'll be

824
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,158
honest when i first heard of cyber

825
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,799
insurance i thought it was a bit of a

826
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,399
crock

827
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,639
um i couldn't understand why we needed

828
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:47,520
it but now that i've

829
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:49,039
done a couple hundred investigations in

830
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:52,080
the last couple of years

831
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,559
uh i can see where it pays for things

832
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,399
and

833
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,678
you know i've i've seen some very very

834
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,080
expensive ransoms

835
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,840
i've seen some very expensive uh

836
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,760
notification campaigns you know the cost

837
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,480
of investigating the cost of

838
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,799
legal the cost of uh having to notify

839
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,200
the

840
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,799
potentially affected individuals the the

841
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,320
pr campaigns around it

842
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:14,000
and and we did a job for a business

843
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,399
recently

844
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,159
uh which was through a broken network

845
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:21,760
they didn't have insurance

846
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,240
and you know it's not a fun conversation

847
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,520
to have

848
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,399
have a chat with someone saying well

849
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,520
look you're gonna have to put your hand

850
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,918
in your pocket

851
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:30,080
and pull out a significant amount of

852
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,320
money that you're never gonna see again

853
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,279
and cyber insurance isn't that expensive

854
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,840
in the grand scheme of things and

855
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,240
there's some

856
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,158
awesome uh vendors that you essentially

857
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,640
get assigned to

858
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:45,840
uh when you have an incident it's it's

859
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,840
more than a typical insurance policy

860
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,760
any other questions

861
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,080
you mentioned yearly tabletop scenarios

862
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,679
do you have any advice for really small

863
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,639
teams can you effectively create it for

864
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:02,480
yourself

865
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,640
um so what we're actually looking at

866
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:08,399
internally because we do some training

867
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,159
with our consultants is group exercises

868
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:11,039
so for those really small businesses

869
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,480
particularly when they're in the

870
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,440
financial sector at the moment they're

871
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,760
under um

872
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,960
scrutiny after the asic um thing

873
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:19,760
recently

874
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,520
is maybe bringing a group of businesses

875
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,600
together who

876
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,240
can't afford or don't have the numbers

877
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,480
to to do an individual a

878
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:29,840
table top exercise or training exercise

879
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:31,760
and have them do it all together

880
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,760
it at least still lets you play it out

881
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,879
and understand and you probably get some

882
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,240
insight from working from other

883
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:41,600
businesses because

884
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:44,000
you're collaborating

885
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,879

886
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,720

887
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,039
um we're going to convene for a little

888
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,039

889
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,440
afternoon tea break and then we'll be
