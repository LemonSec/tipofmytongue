27
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,960
introduction there you know i am

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,080
uh i sort of realized when i was going

29
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,640
through a bunch of pictures for this

30
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,439
presentation just how weird my life is

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,000
that i had a huge arrangement of nerf

32
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,839
toys

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,960
followed immediately by me wearing a tux

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,960
for some reason so

35
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,399
there you go um as uh mentioned i've

36
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,640
been at offset a number of years we've

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,640
run a bunch of wireless tutorials took

38
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,240
people out were driving in a bus

39
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,680
um several times um they've talked about

40
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,600
uh higher education and

41
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,759
uh uh high performance computing

42
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,880
security risk but before all this sort

43
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,000
of stuff i was uh

44
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,360
you know a a young miss korean hacker uh

45
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,479
as a kid um and uh um

46
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,119
this is me in about 1990 and um

47
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,119
i was moving towards what was going to

48
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,680
be a career in i.t i knew

49
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,719
um in all likelihood but uh i got

50
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,119
excited about these

51
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,360
sort of networking things and uh went to

52
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:08,318
to to school in the uk for a year

53
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,440
and uh got to use some real uh more real

54
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:12,160
networks and came back

55
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,200
and helped um uh with my small state in

56
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,959
america arkansas

57
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:19,839
bringing it uh into the internet age so

58
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,599
um uh part of that for me was this i

59
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,000
i've decided to show a bunch of old

60
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,359
origin pictures for for me this is uh i

61
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,160
love skating i love

62
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,040
punk music and i love munich's and uh

63
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,359
this was my

64
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,280
job uh getting public television in

65
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,879
arkansas onto the internet in

66
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,400
93 94 95 and um

67
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,239
that eventually though led me to

68
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,400
australia and in

69
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,680
rural america there weren't really a lot

70
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,920
of opportunities for

71
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,280
you know face-to-face meeting people in

72
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,160
hacker communities

73
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,440
um so it was something that was was

74
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,200
challenging for me to

75
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,200
when i moved to australia to to even

76
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,319
know how to start finding people and i

77
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,159
looked around

78
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:59,760
in instead of unix and security

79
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,000
communities and professional communities

80
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,280
and

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,040
and uh um uh realized that uh

82
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,959
um you know i had a lot of different

83
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,440
interests with it as a business hacker

84
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,239
um and working in the sort of uh um

85
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,959
stayed

86
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,360
ibm world looking like this feller here

87
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,879
um

88
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:20,159
with my proper ibm blue shirt and uh

89
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,000
um uh so this is what led me to

90
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,040
australia is this box that's behind

91
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,519
me there which is an rs6000 um uh

92
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,040
ibm r6000sp it's a parallel systems

93
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,400
platform and the tape drive to my left

94
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,319
was another thing that led me here which

95
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:36,080
is 3494 tape drives

96
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,679
so i did um uh i guess

97
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,280
high performance what was then called

98
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,319
scientific computing um

99
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,080
application uh computing

100
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,599
and really what a lot of we were doing

101
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,760
was consolidating unix platforms in

102
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:51,040
98.99 as part of year 2000 onto these

103
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,879
platforms that really were meant for

104
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,599
better things

105
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,959
so if you worked on one of these types

106
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,959
of systems or had one

107
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,560
in australia at this time i probably

108
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:01,519
installed it or i trained the people who

109
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,840
did

110
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,040
so it was something i got across when i

111
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,920
was working at a telephone company in

112
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,959
the states

113
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,879
but so uh what i

114
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,480
i found was when i went looking for

115
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,798
hacker communities all that really was

116
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,280
around victoria was 2600 which was great

117
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,199
but

118
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,880
i was significantly older than everybody

119
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,079
who was going to 2600

120
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,240
and decided that they were all going to

121
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:25,680
get me

122
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,040
in trouble in some way and

123
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,840
which is funny because i now see them

124
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:33,040
all as a 30-something year old adults

125
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,400
but uh so i i made that went around the

126
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,720
traps to the different

127
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:41,758
unix related um users groups

128
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,120
and um the common one was ibm's which

129
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,000
also then became interaction

130
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,639
later um but uh i i did a lot of

131
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,680
presentations at sage instead of 98.99

132
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:54,880
on hardening aix and using um uh

133
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:57,759
aix as a secure

134
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,159
application platform and um that led me

135
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,320
to

136
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,600
um to to join the australian unix jesus

137
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,120
group which i knew i wanted to be part

138
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,919
of when i moved to australia

139
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,560
and i had similarly had uh you know a a

140
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,159
a

141
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,320
a similar understanding of oscillate as

142
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,199
well because of many of us who worked in

143
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,320
the unix space

144
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:18,000
in um uh the 90s were familiar with

145
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:21,120
um oscert's origins as i guess cert

146
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,840
uh in and sert and

147
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,360
their advice on how to you know put you

148
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:26,080
know secure banners for example like

149
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,960
that was a

150
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,280
an advisory they sent out in 1993. um

151
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,198
but

152
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,359
um this is what i sort of viewed as the

153
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,600
proto thing that led me to assert

154
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,960
um the conference and led me to author

155
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,440
the community

156
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,320
of people who attend the conference um i

157
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,039
was invited

158
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,719
uh um uh to through participating in the

159
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,560
australian union excuses group to

160
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,240
present or i submitted i can't really

161
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,479
remember it was 2001

162
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,840
to the security symposium and at the

163
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,719
very bottom of this which you may be

164
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,280
able to see

165
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,720
it says uh wow and i'm thinking about

166
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,080
now how you're looking at your screen if

167
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,479
you have a full screen you can see that

168
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,318
it says

169
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,000
wireless and security near wise but if

170
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,280
you look further up you'll see a lot of

171
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,800
other names of people that you might

172
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,080
recognize and people that you know from

173
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,120
the illustrator community like there's

174
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:11,359
gary gaskell

175
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,360
there's mike cohen um so

176
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:18,880
okay um so uh

177
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,160
if i'll just really just summarize this

178
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,280
since i'm not expecting you to read this

179
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,360
tiny text

180
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,960
but basically that on this list is the

181
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,240
names of a number of people that is the

182
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,520
first time i've i've encountered

183
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,800
something that met some of them

184
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,359
um mark ames uh gary gaskell dr michael

185
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,840
cohen

186
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,560
um but also people from us are like mark

187
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,719
mcpherson

188
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,319
and uh jamie gillespie who had recently

189
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,840
joined oscar at that time

190
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,759
um many of us got to know each other

191
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,159
then throughout the year of 2000

192
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,800
2001 and 2002 because many of us went to

193
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,880
do

194
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,160
uh in 2002 is the first time the cisp

195
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,440
was offered in australia and a bunch of

196
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,880
us all sat that together

197
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,240
so there's a number of us who knew each

198
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,840
other from this sort of period of time

199
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,800
and every name on here just jumps out at

200
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,400
me like i see

201
00:06:54,800 --> 00:07:02,479
rory brown um uh bob edwards

202
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,120
from uh anu um but uh oh really yeah

203
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,639
there you go

204
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,560
yeah jamie i didn't know he's on here

205
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,039
yeah so um

206
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,919
uh i remember when we took the cisp

207
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,960
jamie and

208
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,599
um you stayed for a good hour after we

209
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,758
were done

210
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,159
um doing us all of a solid of riding up

211
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:21,199
complaining about how terrible the um

212
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:25,680
uh um the questions were i remember that

213
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:28,479
so but so that led us to um

214
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,319
that uh that led us to to oscar 2002

215
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,000
many of the people who um were

216
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,240
presenting at uh

217
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,599
at the the aux security symposium and

218
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,400
this was even the second security

219
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,240
symposium that og had run um uh

220
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,840
presented at oscar 2002 there had been

221
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,840
some other security events around there

222
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,039
was a sands event in 1999 that a lot of

223
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,520
us went to

224
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,960
so it's um yeah like i really get

225
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,719
nostalgic about oscar

226
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,159
the organization the community of people

227
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,240
who attend the events and

228
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,599
um uh the things that we all sort of get

229
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,960
up to so

230
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,120
um another thing that's probably very

231
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,638
hard to read but it's a list of of the

232
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,639
for the very first oscillate conference

233
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,840
in 2002 um

234
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,039
there was a number of speakers who i

235
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,719
believe were probably more invited

236
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,400
speakers and then there were those of us

237
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,000
who did the tracks and here's the first

238
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,159
tracks of the first track

239
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,840
part of wassert and of course you can't

240
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,720
read that because my fonts change

241
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,560
but this is the the first um uh track

242
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,960
presentations and it's you know andrew

243
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,319
vander stalk and rob mcmillan and me um

244
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,400
on these and it's it's a

245
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,080
and michael cohen and bill kaley and

246
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,440
like there's all these people who i

247
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,878
i know and knew like across um security

248
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,958
in australia that we all

249
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,919
had started running into each other uh

250
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,598
then

251
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,718
so here we are right here this is

252
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,640
everybody who presented

253
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,279
um and and this is also impossible to

254
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,319
read yeah

255
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,480
and um the the uh but um the

256
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,760
the what was something for me tier two

257
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,839
on this i go back here

258
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,160
the three of us are presenting after spf

259
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:58,240
like eugene spafford who was a keynote

260
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,240
um which is just amazing so

261
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:03,279
so yeah so on that i i was really

262
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,399
thinking about then and now

263
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,399
and this is something that's always fun

264
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,160
to do with security and um also

265
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,959
apparently with formatting fonts

266
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,519
um since defensive is a little bit scaly

267
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,640
there

268
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,200
um but nothing really changes and we all

269
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,399
know this

270
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,800
and you know that this is probably where

271
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,760
i was going right here so yeah george

272
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,399
kurtz i i

273
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,839
taught profound stone so um george like

274
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,800
they were over as our

275
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,440
uh partner when i was at esec um so uh

276
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,760
yeah it's

277
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:34,000
it's yeah so i wanted to really

278
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,399
like draw the same nostalgia out for you

279
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,000
like i started to draw a nice thought

280
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,680
leadery thing where i compared then

281
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,440
versus now and how nothing's really

282
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,560
changed but it's all changed now it's

283
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,720
just more

284
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,239
nuanced and subtlety yeah yeah that's

285
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,600
true but more than that

286
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,800
um i looked at this and um started

287
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,720
looking at pictures and i just

288
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,800
remembered just how much i

289
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,320
uh even though there were lots of daggy

290
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,040
things about royal pines especially

291
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,680
before

292
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,360
it was redone by rcv um it was

293
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,800
definitely a place i look forward to

294
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,880
every year you know i didn't play golf

295
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,079
so i didn't miss golf sundays

296
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,720
but yeah um hey look at this the tennis

297
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,040
court

298
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,640
you know did i i really feel that that

299
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,399
would have actually been made

300
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,160
more interesting by having an actual

301
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,600
live game of tennis while we were out

302
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,279
there eating every day

303
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,120
but um yeah this sort of rubbery chicken

304
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,680
here and uh on the tennis court this

305
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,800
this

306
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,839
became is now been at least 15-year joke

307
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,040
between me and um

308
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,600
and chris gatford um but this

309
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,800
friends i also see and only see

310
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,200
generally at all sir

311
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:37,920
like there's pat gray there's a bunch of

312
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,480
the the uni security folk who i i hang

313
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:41,680
out with

314
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,959
uh people who are of utas and ex-utaz

315
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,279
and uh latrobe

316
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:46,640
and then we got you know always got up

317
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,480
to sort of ridiculous things

318
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,240
but in a nice tame sort of way so we

319
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,720
gathered up all the balloons

320
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:54,320
and um this was the only picture i had

321
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,760
of a few balloons on the ceiling i

322
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,399
remember by the end of that night we had

323
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,000
a massive

324
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,440
wad of balloons in the ceiling because

325
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,079
you give a bunch of us balloons we're

326
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,200
gonna act like

327
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:06,719
this so but yeah so

328
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,040
it's just uh the the events going out

329
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,200
like

330
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,560
uh i think this is that uh uh on the

331
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,440
right hand side is a

332
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,319
a movie world um when we have uh would

333
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,440
have off-site

334
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,760
um dinners in that and um

335
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,120
also to like all security conferences

336
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:24,959
everybody makes their own

337
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:27,200
event and so uh uh oscert uh for me

338
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,640
um this this was like this is the next

339
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,079
level um like

340
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,839
if i really want to want to get my

341
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:35,680
proper bond villain on

342
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:37,040
um uh it is um uh you you gotta at least

343
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:39,680
turn up with three pretty sweet

344
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,959
helicopters to pick up people so um

345
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:44,880
kaspersky wins that um but

346
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,640
we also had a lot more fun too like as

347
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,079
part of our this is one of assurances

348
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,880
and this is a bit of a now it can be

349
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,199
told

350
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,480
so we learned a lot about the the the

351
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,360
building av system

352
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,079
like the entertainment system in in the

353
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:59,360
rooms

354
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,399
and um uh this even just this ip address

355
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,040
here this 1060

356
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,880
24 i know that that's on level 20 of

357
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,319
that building because we we worked

358
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,399
they did some really smart numbering and

359
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,000
that so we you know created a bunch of

360
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,279
address conflicts and just generally

361
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,040
played around but years

362
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,480
we kept escalating this and we brought

363
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,800
we brought mice with us we brought

364
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,360
keyboards with us each year to add to

365
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,240
uh uh trying to to look at this so the

366
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,000
um uh

367
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,600
what we actually found out was that it's

368
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,399
this pretty complicated little doxus

369
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,120
modem

370
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:29,120
uh it has two two connections and it

371
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:32,639
actually did multicast streams

372
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:33,120
um and um yeah and here it is peter the

373
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,040
tank

374
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:38,320
exactly so um everybody has their own

375
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:40,800
awesome and um

376
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,160
uh that was definitely a a spectacular

377
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,800
stop by my buddy chris

378
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,000
um for that um i always tend to hang out

379
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,199
with the people in the back of the rooms

380
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,399
who were just busy staring at their

381
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,480
phones on twitter

382
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:55,600
um uh uh but um yeah um i i put this

383
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,560
this person playing uh where's um

384
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,959
waldo or wally uh up here for us who was

385
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,518
with

386
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,800
uh one of the vendors just because um

387
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,880
this particular vendor

388
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,719
um we had done a bunch of reverse

389
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:11,040
engineering on the client application

390
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,320
and worked out that there's a

391
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,639
there's a function that allows you to

392
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,240
submit debug information to a central

393
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,079
server for them and it turned out it

394
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,360
just did it over ftp so we sniffed the

395
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:21,279
username and password

396
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,040
and uh we tweeted that password in this

397
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:25,600
picture at uh the vendor

398
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,800
um during awesome and um yeah they

399
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,440
didn't really respond

400
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,120
that's fair enough but um even just by

401
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,160
getting to the gold coast um there was

402
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,800
always that that

403
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:36,560
um you know do i stay at royal pines or

404
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,920
do i stay on the gold coast because if i

405
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,439
stay at royal pines and i'm going to get

406
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,319
into the gold coast i want to do stuff

407
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,839
and vice versa

408
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,199
and we would swap back every year

409
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,800
because it was always whatever we did

410
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:47,439
was always the wrong thing

411
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:49,120
um many years i was stayed in what i

412
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,519
think is a holiday inn now

413
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,480
um but we would look out onto the the

414
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,279
slingshot and

415
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,880
uh mini golf place out here and um it

416
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,079
was just like having somebody just

417
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,360
yeah uh scream you know every uh uh 15

418
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,359
minutes as they're being flung around

419
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,800
with that until about 11 p.m every night

420
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,639
it was a little unsettling

421
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:10,319
um but uh uh yeah i i really like

422
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:12,160
a lot of tacky things and neat things

423
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,320
about the gold coast there's just

424
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,000
strange events that would coincide with

425
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,279
with us there was the year that there

426
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,399
was the furry conference

427
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,920
um after oscert so um uh

428
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,120
we all wandered down there and like can

429
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,639
you imagine wearing one of these

430
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,720
fursuits out on a beach

431
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,079
in the sand well here they were all

432
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,000
doing it and they all had minders

433
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,319
carrying them around and that

434
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,199
and um yeah so i got a picture of me and

435
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,279
my wife and

436
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,639
darren paulie and his wife in the heat

437
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,360
exactly um

438
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:40,959
uh uh hanging out with furries so you

439
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,160
know they were having a good time like i

440
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:45,119
love subculture so

441
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,199
uh you know uh uh good for them but as

442
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,440
always we were walking away from there

443
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:52,479
and we got swung past mcdonald's uh

444
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,079
walking past it saw what is uh

445
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:55,600
blood in the water for hackers like oh

446
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,079
my gosh it's crash

447
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,519
you know so take some pictures here i

448
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,880
love that i can see i hope this comes

449
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,519
through that you can see darren

450
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,720
reflected in this picture um just

451
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:09,360
because uh

452
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:13,519
uh yeah so on that um you know 2018 also

453
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:15,760
um uh two um playing around with the the

454
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:17,120
machine that you use to to print um your

455
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,079
your badge and that

456
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,399
and it's like oh it it well pop the calc

457
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,399
okay

458
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,079
so um and yeah so you know we're moving

459
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:27,760
away from

460
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,359
from royal pines and back to the marion

461
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,959
because that was where that hotel was

462
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,800
where the first officer was

463
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,399
um i really like these these little

464
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,120
creatures who come out and join you when

465
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,440
you're sitting there

466
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,720
um having a drink um and um they would

467
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,160
just you know sneak out

468
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,759
and um but i figured they also put

469
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,639
drinks and lunch on your room

470
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,360
um or going to the airport and um uh

471
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,600
messing with the

472
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,199
the people who are picking people up as

473
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,360
one of my customers

474
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:53,359
who was being picked up and so i decided

475
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,800
i'd wait around to see if they turned up

476
00:15:53,360 --> 00:16:00,160
um and i saw uh still at a at a distance

477
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,920
so but um yeah so i guess really what

478
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,439
i'm sort of getting at is that that uh

479
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,199
we all make our own fun

480
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:07,040
and we are who we are and we are who we

481
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,800
were um and so

482
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,000
uh we can always be our own giants

483
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,880
because the standing on the shoulders of

484
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,360
giants makes us

485
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,399
know how we all build on on progress and

486
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,720
what we do

487
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:18,160
um and uh so i threw a couple of

488
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,560
mixtures of some some

489
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:23,439
uh uh security you know proper security

490
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,079
uh uh consultant from his aphorisms here

491
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,680
as well as um uh uh some beliefs that i

492
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:31,359
sort of followed by as well

493
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,920
um and um yeah i i i really

494
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,040
uh hope that everyone is is uh managing

495
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,639
to cope well with this

496
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,480
and i'm really looking forward to seeing

497
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,279
everyone um next year

498
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,920
um at oscert and uh you know we're

499
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,399
really

500
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,279
you know if if we're always around and

501
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,360
um you know

502
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,560

much

521
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,918
isn't it great in 2020 to look back and

522
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:29,918
think about the journey both physical

523
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,520
and metaphorical that we've all been on

524
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:34,000
as laura points out next may will

525
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,240
therefore be the 20th

526
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,440

531
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,120
afternoon our conference organizers have

532
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,840
been in consultation with uberx all

533
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,879
afternoon

534
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,639

535
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,559
gala dinner tonight the 20 voucher

536
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,840
should be operational now so

537
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:58,240
knock yourself out

538
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:00,000
and a little update on the very popular

539
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,160
lucas are you married

540
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,280
uh question unfortunately the conference

541
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,440
moderators went through

542
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,360
and scrubbed all previous questions

543
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,440
before my request we could get through

544
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,559
to them could they please leave that one

545
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,480
up for the rest of the conference

546
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,000
because at the time that we are at the

547
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,520
time that they scrubbed it there were

548
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,520
82 people that upvoted lucas you married

549
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,840
which is great but if you think about it

550
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:25,039
there were almost 400 people

551
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:28,159
are on at that stage um and

552
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:30,480
and so uh that means that um

553
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,080
you know 82 had asked and you know that

554
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,480
was barely 20

555
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,000
um and so what yeah how does paul lucas

556
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,960
feel thinking that maybe only 20

557
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,240
of people are interested in whether he's

558
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,200
married or not so i've just asked the

559
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,799
question again

560
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,240
go to the q a there and see if we can't

561
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,480
get at least at least

562
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,840
half of the 380 people there so i wanna

563
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,760
i want 190 or more

564
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,600
i want a majority of people now watching

565
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,240
to be interested in whether lucas is

566
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,399
married

567
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,919
spoiler yes he has he's got a wonderful

568
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,960
wife but that's not important that's not

569
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,039
the reason we're doing it

570
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,160
