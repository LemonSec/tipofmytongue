00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:40,079
pay respects to elders past

50
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,320
president and emerging

51
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,919
so i like to kick it off with a little

52
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,079
bit of a story

53
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,280
and this one involves one of my next

54
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,600
neighbors she

55
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,040
lives a few doors down and she had a mum

56
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,679
coming around to her house to deliver

57
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,840
some groceries or

58
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,040
and she walks past this gentleman and

59
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,479
doesn't about an eyelid looks like

60
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,680
anyone else

61
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,520
and she goes to the gates and she

62
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,200
looks at this person at the corner of

63
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,239
hawaii hovering around a car

64
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,959
and she turns full frontal to him and

65
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,319
just looks at him and here he is looking

66
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,280
inside a car

67
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,119
looking very very very suspicious so he

68
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,319
looks at her

69
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,400
looks inside the car looks to her again

70
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,160
and then he picks up a little paver at

71
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,360
the front of our house

72
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:29,680
and just goes whoop smashes the window

73
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,720
and then he reaches inside grab the

74
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,519
handbag

75
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,800
and just like nothing ever happened

76
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,760
casually ever so

77
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,400
just strolls away and then she's there

78
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,879
thinking

79
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,840
with these shopping bags in hand what do

80
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,879
i do

81
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,519
this is crazy i would be thinking

82
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,760
where do you live but you know we'll see

83
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:52,480
these types of crimes happen a lot

84
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,959
so a little bit about me some of you may

85
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,280
know me

86
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,440
some of you may not i've been around the

87
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,879
ulcer scene for a few years now

88
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,640
and i've been helping out with chairing

89
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,599
some of the tracks and

90
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,040
when beck asked and reached out to do a

91
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,839
keynote presentation i was

92
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,400
absolutely over the moon and excited uh

93
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,599
so obviously i said yes because i'm here

94
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,400
so i've been around the world and

95
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,518
doing this security thing and in

96
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,440
australia i

97
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:21,840
have been here as well for a little

98
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,560
while and during that time i've broken

99
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,280
into

100
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,959
many many companies either from a

101
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,480
physical standpoint or from a virtual

102
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,080
standpoint

103
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,599
so i broke into some really really cool

104
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,519
places and that could be

105
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,798
telecommunications companies there could

106
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,120
be banks

107
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,959
uh there could be insurance companies it

108
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:42,319
could be critical infrastructure

109
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,080
government buildings and data centers

110
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,879
all legally of course because the

111
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,560
companies wanted me to do that

112
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,959
and i've also broken into some very

113
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,319
boring and mundane places as well

114
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:57,439
and what did all those places have

115
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,760
in common you might ask

116
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,959
they're all compliant they'll comply to

117
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,200
some sort of standard

118
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:07,040
some sort of um governance framework but

119
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,040
ultimately they're all compliant

120
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,040
and they're all certified accredited or

121
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,798
followed some kind of security standards

122
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,720
and you know this is not an exhaustive

123
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,840
list or a indicative

124
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,880
list of what they were actually

125
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,120
compliant to however it is

126
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,040
um a list of the certifications and

127
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,360
bodies we do have around the world

128
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,160
and each with a very similar approach or

129
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,759
maybe

130
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,600
you know a slightly slightly different

131
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,400
approach but fundamentally they're all

132
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,440
there

133
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:37,599
uh to potentially uh secure their assets

134
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,040
so one big thing that i've noticed in

135
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,520
the past few years and this is something

136
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,360
i've been

137
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,280
thinking about you know for the past two

138
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,919
three maybe four or five years

139
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,880
is that security is not us compliance

140
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,919
rather there's not

141
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:51,199
actually equal security so this is why i

142
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,400
wanted to do this talk

143
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,960
and this is something i have been

144
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,799
thinking about for a while and

145
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:01,520
it really stems from two key times

146
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,919
and the first one is managing and

147
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,320
running

148
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,840
a lot of the the pen testing companies

149
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,240
uh i have in the past

150
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,239
you know you know my career and being on

151
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,960
a lot of those teams as well there's

152
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,160
always

153
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,680
this sense of regret

154
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,720
and frustration from a lot of security

155
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,759
professionals

156
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,400
when i get a customer respond to one of

157
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,280
their

158
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,479
reports or a prospective customer come

159
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,479
up to them and say

160
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,000
hey we want to do a pen test it's just a

161
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,680
compliance activity so

162
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,600
don't worry about it and every single

163
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,759
pen tester always says ah

164
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,280
again another compliance activity i'm

165
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,280
going to find the same things i they did

166
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,719
last quarter it's always these issues

167
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,719
and never fix it uh or you know

168
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,479
something that has happened you know a

169
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,039
few times in the past as well would be a

170
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,240
customer

171
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,320
need to test their pci environment or

172
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,160
their compliance environment and they

173
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,440
will be spending you know over a hundred

174
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,400
thousand dollars on this type of

175
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,360
assessment

176
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:00,719
just because they had to do it and these

177
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,160
are some of some of the conversations

178
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,080
i've had with my clients and

179
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,840
some of you out there might recall me

180
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,800
having this conversation with you

181
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,719
saying we've got to do something a

182
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,000
little bit better than this you know why

183
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,840
don't we actually

184
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,039
deliver a lot of security into the

185
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,039
organization but

186
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,880
ultimately it always came back down to

187
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,240
well we have to tick that box we have to

188
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,319
be compliant

189
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,639
so in this research i found you know

190
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,720
numerous articles numerous white papers

191
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,919
uh numerous youtubes all that kind of

192
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,000
thing and

193
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,359
this quote kind of really really stood

194
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
out for me

195
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,120
and it was from francis doing and it was

196
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,440
only a couple years ago

197
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,160
so she said compliance was meant to be a

198
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,719
flaw

199
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,840
but it has become a ceiling because a

200
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,120
lot of companies

201
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,638
in my opinion use compliance as

202
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,960
the bare minimum of what they have to do

203
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,759
in order to get that next contract

204
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,680
or satisfy the entry criteria for a

205
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,680
negotiation

206
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,840
notable compliance standards frameworks

207
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,840
you know are necessarily bad you know

208
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,599
they do really serve their purpose

209
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,679
however we need to really have a look at

210
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,520
the actual problem that they solve

211
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,440
so compliance has fundamentally not

212
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:07,919
really kept up with today's problems

213
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,440
you have pci dss which was created what

214
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,758
15 or so years ago

215
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,599
by visa and over that time it's going

216
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,720
through a few iterations but

217
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,000
fundamentally the the the industry has

218
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:21,759
gone this way

219
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,400
and the threats have gone a completely

220
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,400
opposite way

221
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,240
um i like also mentioned the threat

222
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,039
landscape has

223
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,520
significantly changed also um since pci

224
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,000
was

225
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,120
created you know 15 years ago between

226
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,479
now and 15 years ago

227
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,880
there wasn't really a cloud really so uh

228
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,199
the the the gold price has definitely

229
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:46,479
moved

230
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,919
so i know as security professionals and

231
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,560
those who present in these types of

232
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,758
forums

233
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,759
always like to uh mention you know

234
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,800
lessons learned from the past and you

235
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,319
know what do

236
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,199
all of these companies also have in

237
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:02,639
common um you know they've all

238
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:05,680
suffered a targeted breach some kind of

239
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,280
major attack or security incidents in

240
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,840
the past few years or

241
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,960
three or four years and always the

242
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,080
vector of the pack

243
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,198
has largely varied so you take page up

244
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,400
for example

245
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,400
um the the the information that i wa

246
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,120
that i was given that was a is a

247
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,638
misconception a misconfiguration issue

248
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,800
and it was not really breach but more of

249
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:28,160
an incident so some data was

250
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,800
was somewhere where it shouldn't have

251
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,959
been capital one

252
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,799
the data was hosted on a public git page

253
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:38,319
and the cause was believed to be

254
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,838
some sort of insider threat target

255
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,959
wheels pick on target because they're a

256
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:45,200
good target despite being pcr compliance

257
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:47,199
you know uh they lost a significant

258
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,519
number of credit card information

259
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,200
just during a conventional antivirus

260
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,279
mechanism and ultimately

261
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,720
certain certain processes and procedures

262
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,240
weren't weren't followed

263
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:00,160
the external party um didn't identify

264
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,600
as you know just had potentially alert

265
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,920
fatigue and just didn't really

266
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,519
click on and investigate the the right

267
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:07,839
the right type of alert when they

268
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,360
suspected it it may or may not have been

269
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,920
an attack

270
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,399
the other one around was a newman marcus

271
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,800
was

272
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,680
again around 2014 and that breach is

273
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,599
identified

274
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,680
uh by a whole bunch of payment cards

275
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,120
that were that were used fortunately and

276
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,399
that was ultimately linked back to new

277
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,080
mexico so

278
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:25,680
so they didn't actually identify that

279
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,720
they were breached as other people going

280
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,839
to them

281
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,480
and also also that was potentially a

282
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,440
malware attackers believe at the time

283
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,480
then again in 2015 uh they were targeted

284
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,959
with an attack

285
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,080
which left 5200 people's personal

286
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,079
information

287
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,200
out out there and exposed because

288
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,040
someone was

289
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,959
forcing usernames and passwords on one

290
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,399
of their login screens

291
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,399
and then we know today we had a

292
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,160
brilliant presentation from brian hay

293
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,240
and laura rejoice talking through the

294
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,040
australian blood blood bank bridge

295
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,440
and um yeah so though so although there

296
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,880
was

297
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:04,240
you know um the uh sorry the

298
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,720
the varied the compromise is

299
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,800
absolutely varied and there was a

300
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,320
combination of potential insider threats

301
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,079
advanced malware with advanced

302
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,079
techniques to bypassing conventional

303
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,079
antivirus detections which

304
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,920
is not really something that's usually

305
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,800
looked at during some sort of compliance

306
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,040
assessment

307
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,719
uh password reuse is very difficult to

308
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,920
identify during the during these types

309
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,240
of assessments as well

310
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:27,519
and misconfigurations of public facing

311
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,760
infrastructure

312
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,360
so what do all these companies have in

313
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:34,000
common as well

314
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,640
again they're all certified or had some

315
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:39,040
kind of accreditation

316
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,720
um and the message of these frameworks

317
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,560
ultimately is

318
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,399
like are they actually required or not

319
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,119
are they outdated are they a waste of

320
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,000
time

321
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,839
i like to think not necessarily but as

322
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,160
i'll go into later in this presentation

323
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,720
i think we need to kind of uh push the

324
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,120
bounds a little bit further

325
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,399
now i know what you're here for it's

326
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,680
statistics and figures

327
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,200
and not just my brand new covered figure

328
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,959
um the compliance requirements and

329
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,399
assessments are on a rise and they're

330
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,920
still increasing

331
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,839
verizon 2020 breach report indicated

332
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,599
that there is a increasing number of

333
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,040
breaches happening in certain sectors or

334
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:18,640
certain areas

335
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,800
and largely it's around web applications

336
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,720
are standing out and there's some

337
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,120
misconfigurations as well

338
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,360
if you have a look at the accenture

339
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,680
report around the cost of cybercrime

340
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,680
it's indicated that you know last year

341
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,479
there's been an increase of around 12

342
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,839
of the cost of cybercrime and overall 72

343
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,000
in the last five

344
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,920
and then again the number of security

345
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,800
breaches increased by about 11

346
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,199
in the last year 67 overall in the past

347
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,199
five

348
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,360
so you know it's looking like it's on

349
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,680
the rise but also when you kind of dig

350
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,200
a little bit deeper into something a

351
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,439
little bit closer to the home

352
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,880
the notifiable data bridge report from

353
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,680
the office of the australian information

354
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,760
commissioner

355
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,199
indicates that this this year only this

356
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,959
year uh

357
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,880
it's dropped by about three percent

358
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,560
since the start of the year

359
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,320
and this could be due to a number of

360
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,479
things right we don't really have enough

361
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:11,279
data to kind of deep dive into

362
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,240
the root cause of the drop my personal

363
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,040
suspicion

364
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:16,240
is that potentially a lot of us in the

365
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,000
defensive space

366
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,279
a lot of us in the i.t space live in

367
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
this admin space

368
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,639
have all been centered and focused

369
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,680
around

370
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:27,279
the covert problem and maybe

371
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,439
didn't spend as much time as it should

372
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:31,120
have or had enough time and there's only

373
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,600
24 hours in a day

374
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,920
on actually the the potential security

375
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,920
and breach problem

376
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:40,560
so the argument really is the compliance

377
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:43,599
is growing up the breaches are going up

378
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:45,599
um so what can we do

379
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,600
so i'd like to kind of show you a bit of

380
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:50,079
a problem and a trend of what

381
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,120
the results for compliance is for a lot

382
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:53,760
of a lot of us

383
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,399
right so i'm probably preaching to the

384
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,200
converted

385
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,079
a lot of ways because um you know it's

386
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,839
likely

387
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,599
organization's going to be targeted and

388
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,880
it's probably not going to be exploiting

389
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,880
an ssl issue

390
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,240
i've i like to quote metal storm here

391
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,920
somewhat but

392
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,360
i've broken into a lot of banks i've

393
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,680
broken into a lot of

394
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,800
you know startups as well and it's never

395
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,279
ever been

396
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,639
for tls or ssl issues and this is

397
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,480
fundamentally a problem

398
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,959
you know they're you know they might be

399
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,760
targeting web applications and

400
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:23,279
misconfigurations

401
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,519
as indicating a report and that's what

402
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,200
we should be actually focusing on

403
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,120
so the issue here is if you have a look

404
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,800
at that that screenshot there

405
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,800
is this is what happens in a

406
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:36,319
vulnerability management process

407
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:39,120
the the internal team gets inundated

408
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,480
with all these issues and i'd like to

409
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,079
kind of have a look into

410
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,560
some time maybe how many of these

411
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,920
breaches were because the analysts or

412
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,839
the security engineering team spent a

413
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,680
lot of their time

414
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:52,320
triaging and fixing issues that weren't

415
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,319
really issues

416
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,639
so what's the solution for makes the

417
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,120
neighbor

418
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,560
if if we kind of go about it potentially

419
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,680
from a compliance river model

420
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:07,199
and go down the path path that all cars

421
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,399
must have some kind of security controls

422
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:11,199
will we all be driving around

423
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:14,320
bulletproof vehicles

424
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:17,519
will we all be having to put additional

425
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,480
locks on our cars as well to ensure that

426
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:21,600
our valuables

427
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,920
are stored and and are safe maybe we'll

428
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,839
just

429
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,040
chain them up to a tree and make sure

430
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,199
that you know

431
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,279
the wheel the car doesn't get stolen as

432
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,079
as well as our other valuables inside it

433
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,839
as well

434
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:35,040
or do we actually need to consider

435
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:36,880
things a little bit more broadly

436
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,279
so what's the solution potentially from

437
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:40,639
a compliance driven approach

438
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,839
and that could be potentially a threat

439
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,880
driven approach which i'm about to go

440
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,480
into

441
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,000
and i kind of like to take a bit of a

442
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,839
side note around

443
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,279
having uh some time and actually

444
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:52,240
investigating this

445
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,760
and researching this presentation uh i'm

446
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,320
not trying to pick on any vendors here i

447
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,760
think they

448
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,680
they definitely do solve a lot of

449
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,240
problems by having a lot of really good

450
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,800
tools

451
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,480
and a lot of really good fixes but i

452
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,880
think

453
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,399
there are a lot of mixed messages and

454
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,079
potentially some of those messages are

455
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,120
ultimately not really helping

456
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:13,120
us as an industry and potentially their

457
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,959
clients actually uplifting

458
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,720
uh their security posture so some of the

459
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,079
messages and they'll paraphrase i want

460
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,360
to kind of

461
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:23,680
uh pick on any specific vendors here but

462
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,880
one of them stated you know how do you

463
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,359
stop information

464
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,480
security incidents the answer is

465
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,759
understandable

466
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,160
find out everything you need to know to

467
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,680
protect your organization from breaches

468
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,560
by implementing the ice between

469
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:38,160
surveillance

470
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,800
27 0001 standard perhaps you need more

471
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,759
penetration testing uh to find all the

472
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,399
vulnerabilities

473
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,959
perhaps need a bug bank program what

474
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,680
about a web application firewall

475
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,279
and i've personally been in the room

476
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,800
where something like that has been said

477
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:55,839
in the past where

478
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:56,399
post assessments the a vendor indicated

479
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,759
that

480
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,759
all their problems could be solved by

481
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,040
implementing a web application firewall

482
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:04,240
and we all know that that's

483
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,519
fundamentally not not entirely accurate

484
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,680
or there might be some kind of scare

485
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,120
tactics you know you could be liable for

486
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,680
a hundred thousand dollars a month if

487
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:14,160
you're found to be non-compliant

488
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,519
and another little story i kind of say

489
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,680
that um

490
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,880
i shout to a friend of mine in industry

491
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,199
appear

492
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,079
and he was indicating around a red team

493
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,680
who recently did

494
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,599
and like all red teamers you know my

495
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:27,279
previous role as the red teamer

496
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,720
uh you get quite excited about it

497
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,320
because they're really really fun

498
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,399
breaking into places and getting paid

499
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,320
for it so he was describing

500
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,680
this red team and i was querying him and

501
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,000
all the ins and outs what was your

502
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,680
vector

503
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,839
of attack how did you get in what you do

504
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,199
laterally move how did you bypass these

505
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:43,279
controls and all those kind of things

506
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:46,319
right to kind of learn off that

507
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:48,880
and ultimately what was done was the

508
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,720
implantation of a physical device into

509
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,439
an organization

510
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:55,519
and i was curious like how how planted

511
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:57,040
device did you query it there or did you

512
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:58,639
kind of you know

513
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,680
ask someone to to plug it in or

514
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,720
something like that by social

515
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:03,040
engineering it means

516
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,079
and the result was no physically broken

517
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,678
okay

518
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,599
and in my mind i'm thinking that's

519
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,319
really cool and a really cool story for

520
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,918
the pub

521
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:12,559
you know i have plenty of stories around

522
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,120
how i broke in to many places physically

523
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,000
and

524
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:17,198
bypass security or jump to turn style or

525
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,919
whatever

526
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,319
but ultimately what's the threat model

527
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,199
like

528
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,480
who is actually likely to break into an

529
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,919
organization

530
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,599
which unless you're the government

531
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,200
unless you're really holding really top

532
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:32,480
secret stuff for

533
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,840
you know uh or potentially a a vaccine

534
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,080
for covert 19

535
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:39,280
that the real threats are probably not

536
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,600
going to be from a physical approach

537
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,678
so i kind of like to kind of move into

538
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,280
what the threat driven model approach is

539
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,799
and maybe relate it to something that we

540
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,360
might all be kind of used to at the

541
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,960
moment or familiar with rather

542
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,199
so lockheed mart have a really good

543
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:54,160
white paper and the link is down bottom

544
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,080
of the slide there so

545
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,240
hopefully you can see that and the talk

546
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,760
has and this book has components of i

547
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,320
didn't kind of rip off all their

548
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:03,600
all their really hard work and i do

549
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,200
thoroughly encourage you to

550
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,000
have a look through and have a think

551
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:11,120
about what their approach is and if it's

552
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,200
appropriate for your for your um company

553
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,799
but here we have a typical approach you

554
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,960
have security on the left

555
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:18,720
you have like this is representative of

556
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,640
most businesses

557
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,000
you have operations response security on

558
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,039
the left you have architecture

559
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,400
engineering

560
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,480
on the right and then you have this

561
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,080
massive wall between the two

562
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,240
where you just get problems kind of

563
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,799
thrown from one side of the fence to the

564
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,320
other

565
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:36,480
and this might look very very familiar

566
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,600
it took me far too long to create that

567
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,200
animation

568
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,039
but essentially what happens is it have

569
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,000
this ping-pong effect or pong effect

570
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,520
rather if i want to use

571
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,600
the the um the reference correctly

572
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,879
and you have the problem kind of thrown

573
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,879
back and forth so

574
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,480
there's a security assessment because we

575
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,200
have to do compliance let's throw it

576
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,039
over there

577
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,039
it's an engineering problem fix up your

578
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,520
problems and then it comes back for the

579
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,039
next

580
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,440
financial round of testing the next

581
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,520
quarter the next year two years later

582
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:04,960
and that kind of that's what we see time

583
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,960
and time again and so

584
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,480
it's a never-ending process and at the

585
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,799
same time what could

586
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,520
potentially happen is ultimately someone

587
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:16,559
makes a mistake someone misses something

588
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,039
and you have an incident so let's have a

589
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,000
look at

590
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:21,600
the potential driven approach right and

591
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,799
this is what we want to do

592
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:26,559
is move the barriers outside and join

593
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,760
the two teams together

594
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:31,600
so what we want to do is have on the

595
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,720
left hand side you have some very very

596
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:35,600
gifted

597
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,039
highly specialized highly motivated you

598
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,600
know secured people with

599
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,320
you know incredible backgrounds and

600
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,199
these people

601
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,918
they want to do is do security stuff do

602
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,039
cyber

603
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,400
stuff and what we really need is to

604
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:51,360
listen to these people

605
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,120
and a lot of the best kind of

606
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:56,879
intelligence and the best kind of

607
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,799
security um advice you're going to get

608
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,480
is most likely from internal security

609
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,520
effect they know they know the layout of

610
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,360
the land right

611
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,280
so what we need to do and these people

612
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,799
are plugged in to what's going on in the

613
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,879
community they attend conferences

614
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,639
like also like all the other conferences

615
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,000
around the world we'll go on virtual now

616
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,440
as well so it makes it a lot easier to

617
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,720
attend a lot more and get access to a

618
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,240
lot more knowledge

619
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,840
they know the threat landscape they know

620
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,559
what's happening out there

621
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,918
they know the latest you know attack

622
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,678
that's targeting a lot of the domain

623
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,520
controllers at the moment right

624
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,120
so they can inform the architecture and

625
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,960
engineering team saying hey this is

626
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,320
this is what we're seeing this is what

627
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,960
we're seeing out there

628
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,240
and this is and then the architecture

629
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,600
team rather can

630
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:39,120
take that information in feed that into

631
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:42,080
the design process

632
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,280
work with the engineering team uplift

633
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:47,120
the

634
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:49,120
the tools and the infrastructures code

635
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,559
or even the legacy applications into

636
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,360
what's actually

637
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,799
most likely to target them and then feed

638
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,840
that back with new patterns and

639
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,080
architecture so

640
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,158
ultimately what you do is you uplift the

641
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,600
security posture by having a more

642
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:03,919
informed decision of

643
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,039
who is actually likely to target you how

644
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:06,559
they're likely to target you where

645
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,280
they're likely to target you

646
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,639
instead of just bouncing that ball back

647
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,918
and forth from a compliance driven

648
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,120
approach

649
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:19,200
all right so back to our

650
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:21,199
example or our analogy rather how can we

651
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,480
use this in a practical sense right and

652
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,159
i like to kind of use

653
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:25,520
and this is why this analogy is perfect

654
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,159
and i feel sorry for my

655
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,520
neighbor but i'm definitely glad that i

656
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,600
knew the story

657
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,720
uh so if we kind of approach it from a

658
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,320
threat-driven approach

659
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,080
and this is something that you all be

660
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,678
very familiar with we have insurance

661
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,960
companies and members of the public all

662
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,880
complaining to

663
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,120
law enforcement and government officials

664
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,360
saying hey this is an increased

665
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:47,280
problem this is happening you know we're

666
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,360
seeing it in the infosec world we're

667
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,480
getting breached this is happening

668
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,080
and the end result is there's vandalism

669
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,280
there's additional costs there's people

670
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,960
being out of pocket

671
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,480
you know insurance companies having to

672
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,080
pay out of their pocket people having to

673
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,760
pay out of their pocket

674
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,120
and then ultimately it's dollar property

675
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:05,600
which kind of fuels the

676
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,479
the the crime gains that might be around

677
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,480
right

678
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,840
and the police take that information on

679
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,159
and they say okay well let's build up a

680
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,158
map

681
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:13,760
where's this happening when is it

682
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:17,280
happening and then what you get

683
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,919
they have an idea and understanding of

684
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:21,600
hey we know the threat landscape we know

685
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:24,799
the crime that's going on

686
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,399
around the communities and we can build

687
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,960
up little hot spots and say well you

688
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,880
know what

689
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,400
this area of melbourne my area of

690
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,720
melbourne this crime

691
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,320
is actually quite prevalent so why don't

692
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,600
we do something about it and we've seen

693
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,879
this in real world

694
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,120
right we've seen all these signs

695
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,960
floating around saying hey make sure

696
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,239
when you step out of your vehicle you

697
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,520
lock up your car

698
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,320
and take all your vault all your

699
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,799
valuables

700
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,240
with you or at least hide them right so

701
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,520
you can lock your car take your keys

702
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,799
hide your stuff

703
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,879
or fill your purse with decoy angry bees

704
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,960
and ultimately you know we need to go

705
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,840
back to that compliance example and say

706
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,240
well

707
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,720
you know all cars must have these

708
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,640
controls is a very blanket approach

709
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,080
right so why don't we just highlight the

710
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,960
areas that we know

711
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,280
are most likely to get targeted and then

712
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,120
it

713
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,440
implements some kind of threat driven

714
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,639
approach to security physical security

715
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:20,159
in this example

716
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:22,080
and maybe cyber security in our example

717
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,919
so this is a very clever use of for

718
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,360
intelligence and just as a

719
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:29,919
as a side note my mother neighbor um

720
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,479
is a trades person and he has a u and he

721
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,640
had the

722
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,400
his tools stolen off the back of his you

723
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,039
and there's a lot of works going on

724
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,720
around my area currently and you know

725
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:40,400
whenever i see a worker out there i'll

726
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,279
say hey just a head's up mate

727
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,559
um there are people targeting traders at

728
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,320
the moment they're stealing tools

729
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,600
just just just be mindful of that you

730
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:49,678
know of not having

731
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,199
extremely valuable tools out in the wild

732
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,960
or out on the tray of your

733
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,880
of your u and they say thanks not to

734
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,799
kind of move on

735
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,400
it's kind of moving back to the overall

736
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,000
threat room approach and i do

737
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:02,080
strongly encourage you to have a read of

738
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,760
that white paper i've kind of taken bits

739
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,720
and pieces from it and kind of

740
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,158
concatenated with

741
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,400
things that i've seen and that i've kind

742
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,440
of experienced and it isn't just a

743
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,679
security problem

744
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:13,440
it's it's something it's it's not a

745
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,039
compliance problem either it's something

746
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,919
that we needed that everyone needs to

747
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,520
consider

748
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:19,279
more broadly as well and it's

749
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,320
architecture teams that's internal teams

750
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,159
i know i'm

751
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:24,559
you know beating the drum that we're all

752
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:26,720
kind of trying to beat all the time but

753
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,678
hey it's not just it's not just us that

754
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,000
needs to kind of

755
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,960
do all these things but what you need to

756
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:34,000
do

757
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,840
as an internal uh team

758
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,840
and one that's responsible for defending

759
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,120
your businesses and your

760
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:42,879
organizations is have a look at

761
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,199
what is the mission like fundamentally

762
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,960
what are you trying to achieve

763
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,960
right there maybe might be various

764
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,360
companies so you might be in finance you

765
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,120
have

766
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,879
certain things you want to ensure that

767
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,320
they don't don't happen

768
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,960
and this is what i did when i was in the

769
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,039
consultancy world on the offensive

770
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,000
side of things is i frequently asked

771
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,559
whenever we were

772
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,799
engaged to perform an assessment what is

773
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,678
the worst case scenario

774
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,918
have you had incidents in the past you

775
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:11,279
know

776
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:14,159
who is likely to target you do know

777
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:15,520
or do you don't know and companies

778
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,559
potentially know these things because

779
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,400
they've had incidents

780
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,080
they've had either operational incidents

781
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,279
or security incidents but there's always

782
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,360
been this level of

783
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:25,600
was that operational incidence a ddos

784
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,678
attack or something else right

785
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,639
um and this is what really drives that

786
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,039
conversation

787
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,080
for you to help identify the very very

788
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:35,200
important points

789
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,720
around the how and the why of a

790
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,240
potential threat actor you really need

791
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,039
to know those points

792
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,080
and then ultimately what you want to do

793
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,879
is

794
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,320
move into address the other aspects of

795
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:46,960
it and there have been times where i've

796
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,960
been

797
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,640
you know on site at a client or talking

798
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,400
to one of my clients or one of my team

799
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,039
members or colleagues or peers in the

800
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,640
field

801
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,960
have been talking to clients and they

802
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,559
all say and you're probably all going to

803
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,960
say i've said that before

804
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,918
i don't touch that system we know it's

805
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,919
vulnerable

806
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,039
uh we don't want to test it we might

807
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,200
fall over

808
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:08,559
uh or it's like yeah we just know it's

809
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,799
been around forever it's going to get

810
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:13,840
decommissioned in 6 months 12 months

811
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:15,039
however long that is the problem that is

812
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,240
fundamentally a problem because that

813
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:19,200
addresses the why

814
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,080
or the where rather so where are threat

815
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,559
actors

816
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,600
likely to target you that is where

817
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,840
you're going to get popped

818
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:27,199
or compromised you're not going to get

819
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,840
compromised

820
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,039
by you know pen testing the latest and

821
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,480
greatest

822
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,080
implementation of something that you

823
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,000
have and

824
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,279
ultimately you have to have it driven as

825
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,440
a as a threat

826
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:40,720
model right so someone's internally

827
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,520
they're most likely going to compromise

828
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,880
and go down there

829
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,879
they're the easiest course

830
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,400
so the process around it should be

831
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,840
around continuous feedback you think you

832
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,559
should be working

833
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,120
together because ultimately you've had

834
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,960
historically you've had compliance

835
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:59,120
pulling you to this direction and you've

836
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,559
had you know the security aspect of

837
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,520
things pulling you in that direction of

838
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:06,240
what you need to do

839
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:08,559
to secure your organization

840
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,000
so i like to kind of go through a little

841
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:12,080
bit of a process

842
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,679
i've got a little bit of time left so

843
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:17,279
ultimately what you want to do

844
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:19,279
is develop a package that's known good

845
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,679
right put that to the side develop an

846
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:23,840
application that uses a package

847
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:26,000
put some security controls around assess

848
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,399
it go through a threat model any aspect

849
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,279
or

850
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:30,080
exercise that applications are known in

851
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,520
good state

852
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,439
but then an operating system that

853
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,080
operating system will be in a good state

854
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,240
after you go through

855
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,559
the same process as well and then you go

856
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:41,279
down to the network level and repeat

857
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,760
then you have to decide a a package

858
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,279
that's on an

859
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,720
application that's on an operating

860
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:46,000
system that's in a network that's all in

861
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,440
a good state

862
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,120
so the end result is that your

863
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,600
contribution

864
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,799
to that it infrastructure or to the

865
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,799
ecosystem

866
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,879
is going to be a lot less because you're

867
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,360
already introducing it into an ecosystem

868
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,399
that's

869
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,399
already in a good state

870
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:07,360
so with all that said

871
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,960
what are the what are some of the the

872
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,000
key takeaways

873
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,679
and chatting to some friends and

874
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,399
colleagues and peers in the industry

875
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,080
around this

876
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:20,239
specific topic and try to get their

877
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,678
understanding of the issue and and their

878
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,760
perspective as well

879
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,039
and one of them said something very apt

880
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,480
says no attacker

881
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,120
will view the compliance tick on your

882
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:30,880
website and move to another target

883
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,479
just like no attacker is going to look

884
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,240
at your laptop on the front seat

885
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,240
and potentially not break the window and

886
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,640
steal it

887
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,240
and we've seen this from many breaches

888
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,240
right it's increasing

889
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,080
the the compliance increase the attack

890
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,840
bridge is a complete uh

891
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,320
increasing and they're probably just not

892
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,320
going to stop

893
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,799
and how much visibility does your

894
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,840
compliance actually provide this is the

895
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,120
question you really need to

896
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,320
fundamentally ask

897
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,399
and i'm not saying we're going to change

898
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,000
it overnight saying hey

899
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:02,000
push back i'm not going to do iso

900
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,600
anymore i'm just saying have a think

901
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,919
about these things

902
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,678
and we need to really unders we need to

903
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:09,679
really ask the question whether or not

904
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,679
compliance is actually addressing

905
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:13,600
security risk of the organization like

906
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,840
who's actually likely to target the

907
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,639
company or it's just the check box

908
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,639
approach that

909
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:20,960
is really providing a potential false

910
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,200
sense of security

911
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,440
ultimately what you need to do is just

912
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,679
go further than just tick in that box

913
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,279
work with your vendors if you do

914
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,159
outsource your security

915
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,520
work with them and push them to to

916
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,080
uplift your security as

917
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,879
a result as well and what you really

918
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,000
want to do

919
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,919
is don't

920
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,760
stop at the ceiling push for what's next

921
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,679
like again work with the vendors

922
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,960
compliance does have its place to get me

923
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,679
around i'm not trying to say we should

924
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,559
abolish

925
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,679
all sorts of compliance but just have a

926
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,440
security

927
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,080
conversation and it should not stop

928
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,760
there the other point i'd like to

929
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:00,080
like to say is you should really invest

930
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:03,600
in in your people or your heroes

931
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:06,799
because most likely they ultimately know

932
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,320
exactly where the threats are and

933
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,720
just coming from an experience

934
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,678
perspective of the amount of systems

935
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,919
i've talked to

936
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:15,120
and i'll say hey if you're pen testing

937
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,039
have a look at that

938
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,239
i've been asking for that for 12 months

939
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:21,440
for 18 months for

940
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,200
24 months and ultimately nothing changes

941
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,200
until you get that report

942
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,760
that says there's a compliance risk

943
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:30,480
because you know this is not fixed

944
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:31,120
and i've seen a few presentations today

945
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,960
and

946
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,559
we're all kind of in the same go in the

947
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,080
same direction where you need to invest

948
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:38,240
in your people

949
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,520
because they do possess that very very

950
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:41,840
specific mindset

951
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:43,120
they do have a very specific approach

952
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,439
and these people

953
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,959
all invest a lot of their time and

954
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,840
energy into this area

955
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,360
of cybersecurity that we're all in and

956
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,678
they live and breathe it

957
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,080
right and we need to also invite people

958
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,760
that are in the non-security area into

959
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,879
forums like this and get them involved

960
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:03,440
into the discussion

961
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:06,000
as well thank you very much

962
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,279
um i'd like to have just a special

963
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,559
thanks to some of the people that kind

964
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,799
of helped me in the past

965
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:13,200
week or so to kind of get this thing

966
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:13,200
started

967
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,279
great stuff lucas thank you very much

968
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:19,039
people are loving it i saw on the chat

969
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,840
they in particular like the animated

970
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,519
pong

971
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,959
powerpoint you said a lot of time

972
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,519
getting that together how long did that

973
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,360
take to uh

974
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,360
i had to youtube how how to do

975
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,320
powerpoints appropriately for

976
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:33,600
security professionals and oh you want

977
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,840
to see that animation again

978
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,600
um so yeah it took far too long it was

979
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,320
like an hour or two of just like what

980
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,918
went this thing

981
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,639
anyway i'm not i'm not good at

982
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,240
powerpoints one one quick question

983
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,640
this this position you've got here

984
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,240
wanted to raise the ceiling and move

985
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,840
beyond mere compliance is this a

986
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,440
distinctly

987
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:53,760
minority view or do you think a lot of

988
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,519
your security brothers and sisters are

989
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:57,760
on the same page as you

990
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:00,000
i think everyone's on the same page but

991
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,240
like i had in that slide before of that

992
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:04,080
twitter screenshot everyone's just

993
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,360
inundated with a lot of that stuff

994
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,439
coming through

995
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:09,600
right they're just so bogged down and to

996
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,679
be honest if you only have budget

997
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:13,840
for one person to look at security for

998
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,399
you for your organization which might be

999
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:18,320
two three four thousand people

1000
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:19,600
and that person all of a sudden has to

1001
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,399
address all of

1002
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,439
those risks or perceived risks from a

1003
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,959
compliance standpoint

1004
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:26,880
they're not actually fundamentally

1005
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,519
addressed fundamentally addressing a lot

1006
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,880
of

1007
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,640
the risks that are actually going to be

1008
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,320
facing a lot of these these

1009
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,000
environments and businesses

1010
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,840
bring up the single question we got most

1011
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,039
on the q a got upvoted to four total

1012
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:42,320
votes it's uh

1013

1036
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,320
the time call like i'm on breakfast

1037
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,159
ready i don't know why

1038
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:31,439
i'm loving the chat i'm loving some of

1039
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,120
the stuff i'm seeing there

1040
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,640
ben for example noticed i was wearing a

1041
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:35,518
different shirt to what i was in the

1042
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,880
morning session

1043
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,799
and on the chat line he contributed

1044
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,640
costume change this is almost as

1045
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:42,399
exciting as eurovision

1046
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,559
and ben then followed that up with quote

1047
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:47,600
i'll take a shot if he manages

1048
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:50,480
a key change and quite now ben

1049
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,760
i would never encourage drinking during

1050
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
keynote sessions but ben if you're

1051
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:56,399
listening

1052
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,320
here is your key change

1053
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,799
i'm doing this out of a friend's office

1054
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:04,158
in a meeting room i just saw a very

1055
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,158
strange look from the woman at reception

1056
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,759

1057
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,760
