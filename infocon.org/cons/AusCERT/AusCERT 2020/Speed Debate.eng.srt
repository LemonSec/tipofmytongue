4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,479
time to have some

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,719
issues uh with the technology entirely

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,400
at my end put my hand up my apologies

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,080

first of all always a popular part of

10
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,799
the conference

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,960
virtual real wherever is the capture

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,400
the flag activities got a couple of

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,880
awards to give away here before our

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,279
final

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,558
speed debate to close it off 2020. so to

16
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,880
kick off the capture of the flag

17
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:36,079
my pleasure to call to the virtual stage

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,480
from context

19
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:39,760
jared take it away jared hey all

20
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,040
hopefully everything's coming through

21
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,519
nice and clearly

22
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,879
uh usually these days most people go

23
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,079
back and call me kelso

24
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,000
that's how i am on pretty much all the

25
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,399
social media sorts of things however

26
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,239
is what it is um i'm a security

27
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,840
consultant over at context information

28
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,839
security we're now part of

29
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,160
accenture sorry the accenture security

30
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,600
group we're a consulting company

31
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,279
that cert we're primarily a consulting

32
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,040
company that does penetration testing

33
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,640
uh through to red team engagements

34
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,560
however i'm sure most people

35
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,680
aren't interested in all of the salesy

36
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,880
stuff and that sort of thing we're more

37
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,560
interested to see how things went with

38
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:15,280
capture the flag

39
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,400
so last year we brought along a small

40
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,159
smart village with

41
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,439
hackable light controllers and traffic

42
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,040
management systems

43
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,960
unfortunately due to the whole covid

44
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,400
situation we've had to reduce the spec

45
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,000
of what we could do this year

46
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,439
primarily due to the remote nature of

47
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,159
the conference and things on those lines

48
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,758
however

49
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,759
that hasn't reduced the fierce

50
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,439
competition that we've seen during this

51
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,280
year's capture the flag

52
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:39,119
with the ultimate winners being decided

53
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,600
within the last few hours of competing

54
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,640
in third place we have a team uh we have

55
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,079
team swillet

56
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,520
with a healthy score of 771. they joined

57
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,398
into the competition late yesterday

58
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,000
afternoon

59
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,759
and spent a lot of time working the

60
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,680
cryptography challenges which

61
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,280
i'm for one had a lot of difficulty with

62
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,640
when we were play testing them all to

63
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,640
begin with

64
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,000
in second place we had with an early

65
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,079
lead we had team

66
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,280
team of one with a score of 1041 points

67
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,440
they burst into the lead early

68
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,599
very late in the competition they worked

69
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,200
hard and held strong for a long time

70
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,280
with the points that they don't

71
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,519
however ultimately there can only be one

72
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,680
winner and in first place with a score

73
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,120
of 1341 points

74
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,959
we have team uq cyber squad this team of

75
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,319
two stayed quiet until the last few

76
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,400
hours of the competition

77
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,760
where they stormed into a head in a

78
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,760
small amount of time

79
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,079
they managed to win the smells uh win

80
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,599
themselves a small bag of hacker goodies

81
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,959
which in this case contains a few

82
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,599
devices such as a

83
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,120
alpha wireless card an ubertruth one and

84
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,399

126
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,319
are about to

127
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,200
rip into it you can vote we will post

128
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,839
the topic

129
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,518
in the q and a section you can upvote

130
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,400
affirmative or negative

131
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,080
for that topic strictly as in with

132
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,439
asking a q a during a session you can

133
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,000
vote very early in the debate if you

134
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,439
want

135
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,360
you can in fact then if you voted

136
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,880
affirmative early on change your mind

137
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,320
and give a vote to negative

138
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,159
you can only vote once for any

139
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,519
proposition however so therefore the

140
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,240
most you can do is change your mind and

141
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,160
cancel even

142
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,919
just wait till near the end okay they'll

143
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,720
be relayed back to me by the miracle of

144
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,440
technology

145
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,919
and if not i'll just say who i thought

146
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,960
won

147
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:33,359
regardless our first topic that cvss or

148
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,280
c

149
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,360
z should go to a rank higher than 10.

150
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,320
i have been saying this for so long not

151
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,360
to influence you

152
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:46,400
okay colby mandy and still

153
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:50,160
will be the affirmative eric david and

154
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,758
phil will take the negative colby if you

155
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,919
are ready my hairy friend

156
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:56,479
take it away that cbss should go to a

157
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,758
rank higher than 10.

158
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,880
yeah um it definitely should go higher

159
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,199
than 10.

160
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,199
uh if you've kind of been around the

161
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,680
same place that i've been

162
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,880
which is the planet earth pretty much

163
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,840
everything has been

164
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,360
rock a tent these past few months and

165
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,919
it's just kind of like

166
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,600
my nephew whenever he sees something

167
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,198
it's the coolest thing ever

168
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,880
and in the same way that every time

169
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,520
there's a vulnerability it's always

170
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,680
the most vulnerable thing ever i think

171
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,639
we need to bump it up higher

172
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,720
11 would be cool you could go all the

173
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,800
way to 100 but

174
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,400
genuine reaction of whenever i see a 10

175
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,000
is

176
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:41,520
oh but you know if i went to 11

177
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,520
maybe you'd get a little bit of these

178
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:50,960
so i can't see a timer but

179
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:53,120
yeah higher than 10.

180
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,159
thank you so much colby that range of

181
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,639
facial emotion

182
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,000
oh an absolute sort of force try and

183
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:01,360
rebut that over to you

184
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,360
eric pinkerton hey so

185
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,880
11. i've just realized colby where i

186
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,560
recognize you from you were the bass

187
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,800
player in spinal tap that's why it's

188
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:12,720
going to go to 11 right it's one louder

189
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:14,720
look i'm old enough to remember cvss 1.0

190
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,800
went to all intents and purposes it

191
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,720
basically got sorted into three buckets

192
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,759
we had low we had medium and that was

193
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,080
and we had high

194
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,680
and we did just fine with that then some

195
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,520
academics got involved and

196
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,280
let's assume some reefers got passed

197
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,520
around and we kind of went from one to

198
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,559
two to three now we're on 3.1

199
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:35,120
we have buckets in that standard this

200
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,080
sort of non and low and medium and high

201
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,759
and critical

202
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,520
we've got a category of risk that we've

203
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,280
called none well

204
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,880
what is the point of that i've got root

205
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,919
but now i can get root

206
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,680
the whole thing is so complex and i seem

207
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,000
to recall bruce schneier waffling on

208
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,160
about

209
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
complexity being the enemy of security

210
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,759
so no no let's not have more than ten

211
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,840
let's go back to having three

212
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,599
and they need to be defined on the

213
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,880
desired reaction that these things

214
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,319
should elicit

215
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,000
one meh two yeah okay

216
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,360
i'll get on to that right after lunch

217
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,800
and three what

218
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,160
hold my sandwich thank you very much

219
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:13,759
eric okay

220
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,720
now appearing just on audio no video but

221
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,560
listen to the words they're gonna be

222
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,560
powerful mandy turner take it away

223
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,360
unmute myself then adam had a tech

224
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,360
problem okay so the common vulnerability

225
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,160
scoring system uses a basis metric of 0

226
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,759
to 10

227
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,680
with 10 being the highest but it really

228
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,680
should go higher some vulnerabilities

229
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,520
are so easily exploitable that they do

230
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,039
some full-on bad stuff and hinky things

231
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,359
to systems so they should be ranked at

232
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,400
least

233
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,919
up to 11 as young colby said 11 is used

234
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,080
to indicate a maximum level

235
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,680
is not a new concept in the world it's

236
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,400
time for vulnerability ratings to get on

237
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,280
board with that

238
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,840
for example the baldwin loco company in

239
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,239
1947 used 11 on the console dials to

240
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,280
mark

241
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,680
maximum speed it was not 10 my people it

242
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,919
was

243
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,199
11. in formula one racing one of the

244
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,240
teams uses the phase

245
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,879
mode 11 to tell their drivers to go full

246
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,759
power full throttle for them is not my

247
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,960
10 peeps

248
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,120
but mode 11. in 2016 the astronomer

249
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:11,520
christoph sonic described the brightest

250
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,160
object in the universe as being turned

251
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,440
up to

252
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,599
11 the stars are in 11 my people and as

253
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,000
my friend eric from the opposition said

254
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,159
let's not forget the 1984 movie this is

255
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,520
spinal tap with the volume dialing right

256
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,360
up to 11.

257
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,680
and not to mention my favorite guitars

258
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,520
ever les paul designed gibsons that have

259
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:32,560
a switch going up to 11

260
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,199
2d note maximum let's learn from the

261
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,000
past

262
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,760
10 is not the maximum peeps the maximum

263
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,479
rating has to be 11.

264
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,640
so the vulnerability system their rating

265
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,399
scheme should go higher than 10.

266
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,160
okay thank you thank you very much mandy

267
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,680
that sounded dangerously close to

268
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,240
research from mine that's your first

269
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,920
warning

270
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,480
okay our video on the negative david

271
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:56,160
john take it away david

272
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,839
yeah so the problem with this reason

273
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,439
about 11 is why do we even have a base

274
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,600
10 system in the first place why do we

275
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,120
use decimals the basis of our numeric

276
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,880
systems and that's ubiquitous across

277
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,519
humanity and cultures it's because we

278
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,720
have

279
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,640
10 of these 10 digits 10 fingers

280
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,160
and the idea that we have more than that

281
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,399
is somewhat concerning to me

282
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,399
if everything's going to 11 people might

283
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,519
want to sign up to ancestry.com and see

284
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,160
if there's something weird going on in

285
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,000
the family tree

286
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,600
well thank you very much david a few

287
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,120
ancient babylonians might disagree with

288
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,160
you but i loved it okay to bring it home

289
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,600
for the affirmative

290
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,000
still gary and what have you got for us

291
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,000
my friend

292
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,680
well adam of course cvss rankings should

293
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,760
go to numbers higher than 10

294
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,040
it's obvious my learner colleagues have

295
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,880
already presented

296
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,760
ample reasons for it but let me add one

297
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,600
more patriotism

298
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,279
covert 19 has caused massive

299
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,000
unemployment all over the world here in

300
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,080
australia

301
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,760
the effective unemployment rate is now

302
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,760
47

303
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:59,439
and youth unemployment is now at an

304
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:01,920
all-time high of 128

305
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,000
this cannot be allowed to continue

306
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,760
changed the cvss system

307
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,040
and there's a huge amount of work to be

308
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,000
done every single

309
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,439
vulnerability will have to be re-scored

310
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,600
jobs for everyone

311
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,839
profits for consultants and while we're

312
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,800
at it we can add in some more important

313
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:19,040
factors to

314
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,640
roll into the rankings such as how cool

315
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,760
is this hack

316
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:26,880
is there a logo and most importantly

317
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:28,480
how many cybers has it got upscale a

318
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,040
cvss system my friends

319
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:32,959
do it for our young people do it for

320
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:35,439
australia

321
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,640
thank you very much still i was hoping

322
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,440
someone would say do it for australia

323
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,120
and we got there

324
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,640
and yes as the father of two young kids

325
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,480
the thought of 126

326
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,839
youth unemployment does scare me to wrap

327
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:47,200
this up for the negative take it away

328
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:50,160
phil kernick thanks adam look

329
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,880
the the the affirmative have been using

330
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,760
reason

331
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,360
and logic and thoughts like the typical

332
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,800
bloody academics they are

333
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,720
that they want to come up with an idea

334
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,079
that's theoretically proper that's going

335
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,959
to work effectively but here's what i'm

336
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:02,239
going to tell you

337
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,079
none of your bastards are going to patch

338
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,959
anyway i don't care whether the cbs

339
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,920
score is 3

340
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,680
or 6 or 9 or 10 or 11. you're still not

341
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,959
going to patch so you might as well just

342
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:16,880
ignore the whole damn system

343
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,399
thank you very much phil short and sweet

344

00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,519
affirmative or negative you've got 30

347
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,480
seconds to jump in there

348
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:29,839
and we'll give you the result of this

349
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,839

351
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,920
and the first debate has been won

352
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,040

on to topic number two

356
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,479
ladies and gentlemen security and

357
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,320
privacy are mutually exclusive

358
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,880
you can't be secure and have your

359
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,680
privacy too brian mandy and david will

360
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:04,560
affirm

361
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,079
jeff still and mike will negate take it

362
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,719
away kick it off welcome to the speed

363
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:11,760
debate

364
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:13,279
brian haye

365

367
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:23,120
okay what a crock of [ __ ] is the motion

368
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,279
of my esteemed opposition that security

369
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,160
and privacy can be anything but mutually

370
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,560
exclusive

371
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,439
these numbnuts will tell you anything

372
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,760
let me quote

373
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,600
the dizzy heights of asd if you're

374
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,560
connected to the internet you're already

375
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,519
compromised

376
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:39,040
privacy does not exist it's a fallacy it

377
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,000
can't exist if you're part of the

378
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,839
internet

379
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,160
privacy is an exercise in risk

380
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,240
management life is an exercise in risk

381
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,279
management driving a car is an exercise

382
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,360
in risk management

383
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:52,240
you want to save 1200 australian lives

384
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,600
every year ban motor vehicles see

385
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,399
no one's going to do that we're going to

386
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,600
manage the risk security is an exercise

387
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,600
in risk management

388
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,959
security today and tomorrow is more and

389
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,600
more about biometrics

390
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,319
your identity your identity is your key

391
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,240
therefore how

392
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,480
if you can't use your key and therefore

393
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,600
compromise to some extent your identity

394
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:13,680
slash your privacy where you gonna go

395
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,800
if you want to be secure and you do want

396
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,399
your privacy

397
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,519
easy turn off the internet thank you

398
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,800
very much brian

399
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,959
jeff your chance to lead off the

400
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,479
negative take it away

401
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:26,880
security and privacy are mutually

402
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,920
exclusive totally

403
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,519
not you're kidding me right okay

404
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,639
sorry for the affirmative i feel so sad

405
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,360
for you you've got to lose in case i'm

406
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:37,440
going to do a ned simpson on you

407
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,800
okay seriously being private is not

408
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,519
being secure look

409
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:44,399
privacy venn diagram circle security of

410
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:44,399
iron diagram cycle

411
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:51,279
i've just been pac-man's okay uh look

412
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,959
um security elements are pretty much

413
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,360
confidentiality integrity and

414
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:57,279
availability

415
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,519
confidentiality privacy come on baby

416
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,519
uh tell that to the group of uh

417
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,000
besamotos reveal their secrets and uh

418
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,160
protect

419
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,680
our own you know there's a couple people

420
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:07,040
who do have that moto reveal their

421
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,439
secrets and protect our own

422
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,560
anyway um ah come on there has to be

423
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,399
another interpretation

424
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,399
it's too easy for us to win come on this

425
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:18,000
this is give away to the negative side

426
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:19,440
um uh chair entity whoever you are

427
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,880
can we give the brownie points to

428
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,920
affirmative no okay no problems we'll

429
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,439
try to figure out look

430
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,120
god perhaps there's something in there

431
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,160
if people are being private then society

432
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,880
is less secure

433
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,880
haha chair entity i'll take those ready

434
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:34,160
points back from affirmative

435
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,160
look um if you've got um

436
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,600
if you have the village that knows

437
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,120
everything then perhaps the village can

438
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,519
protect you you don't have privacy but

439
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,680
you have

440
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:43,440
uh you have security but then again what

441
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,719
happens if those secrets go away

442
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:48,320
and it gets compromised then you get

443
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,079
to have to be coached to do something

444
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,440
that you don't want to do in other words

445
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,439
you're no longer secure

446
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:54,480
you gave away your privacy you gave away

447
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,680
to security

448
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,959
i'm sorry we win

449
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,638
thank you very much there jeff venn

450
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,239
diagram and dancing i loved it but don't

451
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,639
worry with chair or entity

452
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,320
just call me sir okay mandy turner back

453
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,279
to you to take the affirmative please

454
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:10,720
mandy hey so i really do think we should

455
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,480
give jeff a point for the pac-man

456
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,880
reference that was pretty cool

457
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,160
but let's go beyond the whole cybers and

458
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,480
look at security as a whole

459
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,279
so we've got cctv public surveillance

460
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:21,279
technology

461
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,880
it's capturing images of you picking

462
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:25,120
your nose and cheating on your diet with

463
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,240
a donor

464
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,639
it's privacy invading technology that in

465
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,320
2013 led to boston marathon bombing

466
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,399
suspects being identified

467
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,000
so people were more secure in the end

468
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:39,279
because of

469
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,959
privacy being invaded the cctv does

470
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,759
invade your privacy but gives you more

471
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,479
security

472
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,759
cctv is a security mechanism and part of

473
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,959
crime prevention through environmental

474
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,880
design

475
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,719
it looks at all the things that you do

476
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,240
there are cameras everywhere big brother

477
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,000
is definitely watching you but you are

478
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:56,639
more secure for it

479
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,480
cctv is a security mechanism it's

480
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,839
invading your privacy but because it

481
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,880
invades your privacy

482
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,480
we have a more secure world thank you so

483
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,160
much mandy to continue the case

484
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,480
for the negative security privacy are

485
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,680
mutually exclusive you can't be secure

486
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,120
and have your privacy too

487
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,439
here to disagree take it away

488
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,480
stuargarian

489
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,279
thank you sir sir i want you to imagine

490
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,560
me

491
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:23,519
naked in my bedroom right

492
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,319
sir yes look i know i know but stay with

493
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,680
me

494
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:30,160
it's all okay because i have curtains

495
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,880
i protect my privacy with curtains

496
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,519
sometimes

497
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:35,120
underpants as well but in this case it's

498
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,240
just the curtains but here's the thing

499
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,240
about curtains

500
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,600
they have to be fastened to the top of

501
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,440
the window

502
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:46,399
securely right my bedroom privacy is

503
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,519
intimately intimately intertwined with

504
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,160
the security of

505
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:51,600
my curtains otherwise it'd be curtains

506
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,360
for my privacy

507
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,040
and also for your sense of moral

508
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:56,880
well-being now

509
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,880
substitute my private parts with your

510
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,800
medical records and banking details

511
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:02,399
my underpants with your passwords and

512
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,198
two-factor authentication

513
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,400
and my curtains with a firewall or as it

514
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:19,839
should really be called

515
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:19,839
a cyber curtain it's obvious really

516
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,000
so the problem with privacy and security

517
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,320
going hand in hand

518
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,679
is that you want to implement security

519
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,639
in a way that's private you have to do

520
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,799
it yourself

521
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,480
i remember i actually once foolishly

522
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,639
tried to engage richard stallman

523
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,799
true story engaged richardson stormwind

524
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,559
to give a presentation in brisbane

525
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,918
and he runs his own email server takes

526
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,840
48 hours to respond

527
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:53,280
etc etc has this whole protocol because

528
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:55,760
he won't put anything in the cloud

529
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,840
won't allow you to do it but your that's

530
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,960
richard storman right so he's capable of

531
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,000
running these systems

532
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,600
himself what about people these days uh

533
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,120
there's a great bit from a stand-up

534
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,840
comedian where he says if you line up

535
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:09,280
every single person uh in line from the

536
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,039
smartest person in the world to the

537
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,799
stupidest person in the world and you go

538
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,720
to the person right in the middle

539
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,320
they're going to be a gibbering [ __ ]

540
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,280
can that person implement security

541
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,520
themselves

542
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,960
no they have to delegate it to greater

543
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,200
minds to smarter people

544
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,720
to google to amazon to big brother they

545
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,240
can think for you don't try and think

546
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,320
for yourself

547
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,919
thank you so much david we are back on

548

00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,120

550
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:41,360

00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,200
thank you very much adam so young

552
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,039
rudiger knows that he shouldn't use his

553
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,720
real birthday when he signs up for the

554
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,520
rewards program at the coffee shop near

555
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,760
his office

556
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,440
he knows that he must only enable his

557
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,799
webcam when he needs it for that

558
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,480
important zoom meeting

559
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,240
and in his home office he's put up a

560
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,840
screen in front of the bookcase so that

561
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,960
all his clients can't see his collection

562
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,559
of doctor who books

563
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,240
that might give away too much personal

564
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,720
info about his hobbies

565
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,320
radiga is a good citizen he follows the

566
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,520
advice from our fabulous e-safety

567
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,000
commissioner

568
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,200
he has completed all of his online cyber

569
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,640
security training modules in his

570
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,280
workplace and he said

571
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,919
no thanks bob i won't use your answer

572
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,280
cheat see

573
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,600
to go straight to the security

574
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,399
assessment i'll review the whole course

575
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,959
content

576
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,720
he's secure and he's private too

577
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,720
thank you so much mike the debate is

578
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,240
done and does to go to the q a section

579
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,840
now and vote and while you're voting can

580
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,360
i just quickly clarify

581
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,120
i had a question someone asked me very

582
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,799
directly that white towel i was using

583
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,199
after stig's reference to nudity

584
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,080
was purely to wipe away tears ladies and

585
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,400
gentlemen

586
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,080
tears you've got 15 seconds to get your

587
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:53,840
votes in

588
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:53,840
i don't want to know i do

589
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,919
i think he had to stab himself in the

590
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,919
eye to get that image out of his head

591
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,480
now now now now i'm waiting for the

592
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,480
confirmation of the result

593
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,240
landslide

594
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,799
so that would work whole lot better if

595
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,919
there was a separate q a item for each

596
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,440
question wouldn't it and

597
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,039
you wouldn't have to do sums in your

598
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,559
head adam i

599
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,879
and i can't even see it unfortunately

600
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:34,960
due to the technical issues

601
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,960
120 for negative 37 for affirmative ah

602
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,039
that includes the other question doesn't

603
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,039
it

604
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,520
123 negative 38 affirmative yeah

605
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,840
but it includes the first question i'm

606
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,120
being told the negative has won

607
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:50,559
convincingly uh i might pad for a couple

608
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,760
of seconds if someone wants to remove

609
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,360
affirmative and negative

610
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,440
one a section and then put it back in

611
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,199
again to make sure we don't accidentally

612
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,880
double up on the count but i'm calling

613
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,039
this negative that's the way we roll

614
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,640

like

639
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,480
that's either like a coffee or a

640
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,240
lamborghini but

641
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,559

tray we can get this we can get a real

643

00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,440
affirmative just

00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,480
let's face it

654
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,439

655
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,080

that uh just like you

706
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,000

707
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,760
internet

708
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,159
and traded and mashed into collections

709
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,919
and if you are high enough on the social

710
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,919
status then you can be included in two

711
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,720
databases in which uh the papers are

712
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,799
published and

713
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,000
and where the rich can say oh okay on

714
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,000
which database are you

715
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,440

thank you very much jeff he comes with

721
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,840
his own sound effects i love it mandy

722
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,760
you're on the negative this time over to

723
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,720
you mandy turner thanks for reminding me

724
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,520
i had a bit of a problem now i thought

725
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,600
it was affirmative

726
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,760
okay no sorry we won't give in to

727
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,639
extortionists we will not negotiate with

728
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,240
criminals

729
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,960
and i want to know why they're asking

730
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:41,039
for bitcoin monero's harder to trace

731
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,039
we are not going to pay the ransom if we

732
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,760
pay we'll identify ourselves as people

733
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,158
that pay

734
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,120
we are not people that pay and we don't

735
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,559
want the

736
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,239
question unlocked anyway because it'll

737
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:51,678
probably be really hard and it's even

738
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,720
worse if it's a really hard question

739
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,360
like go back to that

740
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,360
thing about cv s stuff don't want that

741
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:59,360
so no i'm not unlocking it anyway

742
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,039
and if we did pay that bitcoin the

743
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,479
criminals will take our money and fly

744
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,600
off to the soon-to-be republic of

745
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,840
barbados

746
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,600
post covert holidays and we'll never

747
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:09,439
have our question decrypted

748
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,120
there's also no guarantee that the

749
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,799
encryption algorithm will

750
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,320
work properly and the question will

751
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:16,480
never be recovered properly

752
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:18,480
and if it is it won't make sense to us

753
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,440
so if no one ever pays that ransom

754
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,440
we'll all be better off

755
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,279
thank you very much mandy to close the

756
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:29,360
debate for

757
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:32,919
the affirmative eric pinkerton

758
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:36,678
eric okay right hang on

759
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:40,480
0.05 bitcoin is

760
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:41,679
746 dollars now it's 2020 let's face it

761
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,640
what else are you going to spend that

762
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:46,799
money on how much artisanal gin flavored

763
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,279
hand sanitizer and novelty hoodies can

764
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,320
you get

765
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:51,840
for for 723

766
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,600
let me tell you something those russian

767
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,439
criminals need that money because in the

768
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,959
evenings they go out to nightclubs and

769
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,640
give that money straight to the russian

770
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,640
ladies who work in those nightclubs

771
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,559
and those ladies have literally nothing

772
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,840
to wear and do you know how cold it gets

773
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,520
in that part of the world

774
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,279
tell me this have you got a backup of

775
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,520
that question that doesn't matter

776
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,960
because if you don't pay

777
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:12,480
704 dollars within the next two days

778
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,200
it's going to get leaked on the dark web

779
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,120
soon anyway

780
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:16,240
and everyone will see the question so

781
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,799
vote affirmative

782
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,919
and pay up your tight asses it's 20 20.

783
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,320
people are paying 10

784
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,200
000 on ebay for rare furry ushies for

785
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,360
god's sake

786
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,679
it's only 686 dollars if you pay in the

787
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:29,918
next 20 seconds

788
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,880
what a decent humanitarian you are just

789
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:32,640
caring about

790
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:34,640
cold russian women thank you so much

791
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:38,080
eric an emotional tour to force

792
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,000
still wrap it up for us thank you sir

793
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,320
the the question i have for you ladies

794
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:44,799
and gentlemen is exactly how much of a c

795
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,918
word do you want to be and by c word of

796
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,879
course i mean

797
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,520
criminal okay your thing has been

798
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,720
encrypted

799
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,480
and you really don't want it to be

800
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,760
because you've been a careless c word

801
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:56,320
the other kind

802
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,120
who doesn't have a backup well done you

803
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,080
that's probably

804
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:02,479
criminal negligence right there so now

805
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:04,158
you propose to pay these other criminals

806
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,400
you actually want to incite these

807
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:08,320
criminals to further act they're doing

808
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,720
cyber things people and as you know

809
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,360
everything cyber is terrorism you are

810
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,960
planning

811
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:17,840
to fund acts of terrorism

812
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:19,200
even worse though you plan to pay them

813
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,080
in bitcoin

814
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,919
really bitcoin is a crime against

815
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,000
humanity not only because everyone

816
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,320
involved should be in jail but because

817
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,960
to pay your

818
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,600
0.05 bitcoin you'll burn off more fossil

819
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,360

820
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:39,039

00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,960

dive in there and upvote either negative

828
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,520

830
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,879

vulnerabilities

838
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:17,600

against jeff mike and eric brian take it

840
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:21,439
away please

841
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,039
a crock of [ __ ] that programmers don't

842
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,279
cause vulnerabilities

843
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,799
if you want something cocked up give it

844
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,760
to a programmer

845
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:31,440
but let's not be too harsh anyone any

846
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,879
person can stuff it up

847
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,640
programmers don't have a mortgage on

848
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,159
that privilege it's part of human nature

849
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,640
to stuff things up

850
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,000
code is fundamentally static unless you

851
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:42,240
make it dynamic

852
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
but isn't that a simple self-generating

853
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,399
version of static and who wrote that

854
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,760
a programmer they see themselves as the

855
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,678
parents of creation

856
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,039
and like most things that are created

857
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:53,039
they're far from perfect

858
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,158
so they again can't hide from their

859
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,919
responsibilities

860
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,760
this is not a chicken and egg scenario

861
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,640
where we have to figure out what comes

862
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,559
first

863
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,640
we know when it comes to coding who gave

864
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,960
birth to that little palette of genius

865
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,559
i rest my case and just a disclaimer no

866
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,080
programmers were injured or abused in

867
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:11,120
the making of the submission

868
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,080
thank you very much brian okay jeff over

869
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,799
to you to lead

870
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,840
off the negative take it away jeff blame

871
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,679
the people why don't you

872
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,120
actually yes i will blame the people i

873
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,919
will blame not the programmers but the

874
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:22,158
engineers

875
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,440
and it is t you i almost said something

876
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:25,200
bad in cantonese i'm sorry but that's

877
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:28,080
okay it's just french for yogurt

878
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,760
you know engineers too get your acts

879
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,158
together you think you can do crypto

880
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,879
you have a goddess web five minutes of

881
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,399
wide

882
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,480
equivalent protection thank you very

883
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,760
much engineers frush

884
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,600
you had an opportunity to separate

885
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:41,200
instructions and data and then you had

886
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,158
too much beer and toggle party and then

887
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,039
you gave us the new

888
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:46,640
machine fantastic lovely okay well uh

889
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,919
and then you it took us five generations

890
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,440
of programming language to get finally

891
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,279
right well kind of not really

892
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,320
okay c c sharp c c c plus c plus plus c

893
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:56,320
sharp

894
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,840
and did it get better no if there was a

895
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,279
language that could precisely tell verbs

896
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,840
and objects in exactly the way that it

897
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,520
needs to be

898
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,199
that problems would go away i think i

899
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,679
can tell i think i'll call it

900
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,360
latin plus plus latin sharp okay oh no

901
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,600
wait people need to use it

902
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,199
and not everybody knows latin i think

903
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,600
i'll call it esperanto sharp

904
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,640
lovely oh don't worry i'm an engineer

905
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,360
don't worry it's okay

906
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:19,360
it'll go away thank you so much jeff

907
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,120
here making his fourth and final

908
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:22,080
appearance in the 2020 on cert speed

909
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,399
debate take it away

910
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,399
still

911
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,559
thank you sir look i have another

912
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:31,200
question for you ladies and gentlemen

913
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,720
who created programming languages

914
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,360
programmers that's who

915
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,080
jeff who just spoke is just plain wrong

916
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,320
even if you

917
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,000
accept his ludicrous position the

918
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:41,360
programming languages themselves somehow

919
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
cause the vulnerabilities

920
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:46,240
who created those tools well the very

921
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,240
tools that make vulnerabilities possible

922
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,120
were created by those other tools

923
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,120
the programmers that's who programmers

924
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,080
deliberately created programming

925
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:56,080
languages

926
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,360
they deliberately created so many

927
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,480
programming languages that it's

928
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,158
impossible to learn

929
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,240
any of them thoroughly and as soon as

930
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:03,440
one language becomes popular they invent

931
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,200
another one

932
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,279
why aren't we writing iphone apps in

933
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,279
cobol i ask you

934
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,720
all this could be solved however if

935
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:14,000
every program was written

936
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:16,240
in perl if programmers made a correct

937
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,840
choice and chose the only correct

938
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,480
flawless and simple to comprehend

939
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,320
language by which i obviously mean pearl

940
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,240
then vulnerabilities would vanish

941
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,320
overnight that programmers

942
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,480
choose not to do this though is an

943
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:32,399
indictment on the entire

944
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:34,159
so-called profession thank you thank you

945
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:35,439
so much still i know once you want to

946
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,039
hear jokes like hey

947
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,640
why aren't we writing iphone apps in

948
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,960
cobol

949
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,480
i'm doing the oscar speed debate okay to

950
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,120
carry it on for the negative take it

951
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,880
away

952
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:48,320
mike thank you sir now i don't even know

953
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:50,159
where to start with that so i'm going to

954
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,399
tell a story instead so

955
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:53,279
so young jane went to university she

956
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:54,879
studied i.t

957
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,279
she received honours for her four years

958
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,240
of hard work she's an absolute wizard

959
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:01,840
programming

960
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,600
in pearl in her new job in the graduate

961
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,158
program her manager assigned her to a

962
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,678
team

963
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,240
and she started working on a portion of

964
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,960
her project but of course her manager

965
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,960
had made

966
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,000
unrealistic promises to the client

967
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,600
delivery team

968
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,159
now jane is under pressure to deliver

969
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,080
her part of the project faster

970
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,519
so in her haste she forgot to bounce

971
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,120
check something and

972
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,440
you know the project was completed on

973
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:24,000
time the company's client database was

974
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,840
hacked

975
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,039
and id care had to step in and help

976
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,959
their customers and

977
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,279
no this company wasn't an assert member

978
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,080
by the way so that jane's now working at

979
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,720
oscert where we value security overall

980
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,879
else

981
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,600
programmers don't cause vulnerabilities

982
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,080
managers do

983
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,600
okay thank you very much mike to wrap up

984
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,399
the argument for the affirmative i'm

985
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,678
throwing to you now

986
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:49,600
phil kernig take it away phil thanks

987
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,880
vince

988
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:55,840
so hi uh my name's phil

989
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,640
and i'm a programmer it's been a number

990
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,199
of years

991
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:00,240
since i've written the line of code and

992
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,320
i really want to

993
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,840
i feel the need to automate i really

994
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,639
want to get back on the code

995
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,080
but every time i do i [ __ ] up every time

996
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,840
i do i write a vulnerability

997
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:11,120
every time i do something screws up and

998
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,799
then i lose my chip

999
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,039
i've got my eight year chip of not

1000
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:15,519
writing any code and i haven't screwed

1001
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,000
up

1002
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:19,279
but if i do i will and as we know here

1003
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,279
at programmers anonymous

1004
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,399
we don't blame the booth sorry the drugs

1005
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,440
sorry the code

1006
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:25,840
we blame ourselves we take

1007
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:29,360
responsibility

1008
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:31,039
it's the programmers it's not the code

1009
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,639
stay strong brother stay strong phil

1010
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:33,919
remember you're only one key stroke away

1011
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,440
from falling back in

1012
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,120
eric close it out for the negative

1013
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,919
please

1014
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,120
okay so programmers are people and those

1015
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,120
that you that know me

1016
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,120
will know that my entire philosophy for

1017
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:46,799
cyber security can be distilled into

1018
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,120
three simple contexts

1019
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:51,200
simple concepts cyber security is not

1020
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,559
about the cia triad or people process

1021
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,960
technology and all of that

1022
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,678
cybersecurity comes down to three things

1023
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,640
people

1024
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,720
are [ __ ] you laugh but consider this

1025
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:03,039
there are three types of shitty people

1026
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:04,559
people who are evil people who are lazy

1027
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,399
and people who make mistakes

1028
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,840
and if you draw a venn diagram of those

1029
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:09,679
three personality types

1030
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,040
computer programmers fit nicely in the

1031
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,480
intersection of all three

1032
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,239
and if you've ever done any coding

1033
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,520
yourself and i work in infosec so i'm

1034
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:16,959
going to judge you if you haven't

1035
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,800
when you hit the compile button for the

1036
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,240
first time you realize that programmers

1037
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,079
who write the programming languages

1038
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,839
are the most evil lazy inept shitty

1039
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,280
people there are so by voting

1040
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,040
affirmative you're absolving those

1041
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:28,159
sandal wearing beady bastards of their

1042
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,159
heinous crimes

1043
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,440
now the more astute ones amongst you and

1044
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,599
the people on my panel

1045
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,679
will have realized that by now i may

1046
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,200
have mistakenly just argued against my

1047
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,040
own team's assigned position

1048
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:41,199
but what you haven't factored in is that

1049
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,879
i was too lazy to fix it and too evil to

1050
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,638
care so i rest my case

1051
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,319
so vote negative anyway because

1052
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,960
computers do what you damn well tell

1053
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,359
them to do

1054
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,960
not what you bloody want them to do okay

1055
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,078
thank you very much erica i think wants

1056
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,599
us to vote for

1057
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:55,440
i'm not sure but it's over to you now go

1058
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:58,880
to the q a box vote for you

1059
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:03,839
for the if you if you if you agreed with

1060
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:03,839
eric you've i don't know

1061
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,040
we need another pole which is which is

1062
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,560
better pearl or cobalt

1063
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,480
i'm being told the winner in this one is

1064
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,119
the affirmative congratulations brian

1065
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,920
still

1066
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:21,200
and phil and uh congratulations eric

1067
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,960
because

1068
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,560
i think you sort of had a moral victory

1069
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,440
there anyway okay

1070
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,240
let's move on to topic five username and

1071
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,200
password

1072
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,919
are two factors and therefore count as

1073
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,720
two

1074
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,640
factor authentication ryan colby and

1075
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,040
phil against mandy mike and david take

1076
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,040
it away

1077
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:48,160
brian

1078
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:49,520
all the time i've been saying what a

1079
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,399
crock of [ __ ] and you think i was saying

1080
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,920
what a crock of [ __ ]

1081
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:54,640
in actual fact i was saying what a crock

1082
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,280
of [ __ ] can you people not count

1083
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,040
one plus one equals two why is it

1084
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,079
security people have this never-ending

1085
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,160
desire to make

1086
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,760
simple things more complicated there is

1087
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,759
a reason we've migrated

1088
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,680
to multi-factor authentication because

1089
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,400
it needs to be more than username plus

1090
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:11,520
password

1091
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,079
more than two-factor authentication is a

1092
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,119
username

1093
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:16,320
and authentication yes they call it an

1094
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:18,000
identity

1095
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,760
the username has to be checked and

1096
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,560
validated by the system in order to be

1097
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,359
allowed

1098
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,560
access is that not a process of

1099
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:28,160
authentication

1100
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:29,680
that's one one one the password two has

1101
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,759
to be validated in conjunction with the

1102
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:34,000
username it authenticates

1103
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,200
that's two now we have two factors of

1104
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,839
authentication

1105
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,399
i reiterate one plus one equals two case

1106
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:41,839
dismissed

1107
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,520
thank you very much brian i can announce

1108
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:45,200
exclusively brian's personal fashion

1109
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,119
range will be available through the old

1110
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,040
cert website at the conclusion

1111
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,880
of this conference mandy take it up for

1112
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:53,040
the negative please

1113
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,480
okay sadly i don't have a wonderful

1114
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,320
shirt like you there brian but i

1115
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:59,119
wouldn't mind it that's pretty cool

1116
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,040
go brian okay sorry we're on the wrong

1117
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:03,760
side not supposed to say go brian

1118
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:05,200
username and password are actually two

1119
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,119
factors yes they are

1120
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,040
but they're only one factor of

1121
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:11,520
authentication

1122
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,440
username and password is single factor

1123
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:15,119
like the dragon is at your door and has

1124
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,520
the key to your house

1125
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:18,880
your door is your username the key is

1126
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,800
your password

1127
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,480
but if it's 2fa there's an extra layer

1128
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,880
of protection for example

1129
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:26,720
the dragon is now at your front door it

1130
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,560
has the key to your house

1131
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:29,520
it doesn't have a posable thumb so the

1132
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,279
dragon actually is going to have

1133
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,320
problems with the key anyway

1134
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:35,359
but you have a moat around your house so

1135
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,720
that's your other factor of

1136
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:39,119
authentication

1137
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,200
and there's piranhas in there which

1138
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,800
actually makes it another factorable

1139
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,560
indication and i am completely lost

1140
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:47,359
because it's been a really long day okay

1141
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,799
so two-factor authentication is more

1142
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:50,880
than username and password

1143
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,240
the dragon is at the door to your house

1144
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:54,000
but it can't get past

1145
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,479
because there is a moat filled with

1146
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,000
piranhas two factor requires two

1147
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:59,920
different security authentication

1148
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,839
methods not just your username

1149
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:03,520
username and password is single factor

1150
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,078
authentication the password is only the

1151
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,800
the

1152
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:08,800
only authenticator there two-factor

1153
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,680
authentication is the piranha-filled

1154
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,000
moat

1155
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,240
plus the key to the house and opposable

1156
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,960
thumbs being able to use it

1157
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:18,319
so although using our password are two

1158
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,960
things they are not

1159
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:23,040
two security factors because there are

1160
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,720
no piranhas

1161
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,640
thank you very much mandy evolutionary

1162
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:28,399
biology meets game of thrones okay

1163
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,640
colby take it up with the affirmative

1164
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,359
please my friend over to you

1165
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:35,200
um that metaphor is as my good friend

1166
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:37,520
brian would say a crock of [ __ ]

1167
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,480
because there isn't just one door you're

1168
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,640
in a hallway

1169
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,079
of tens of millions of doors he's not

1170
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,560
even gonna find your door

1171
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:45,359
no one even knows what my password is

1172
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,880
it's

1173
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:48,720
it's not my email address don't worry

1174
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,359
about it but

1175
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,560
you know people always say that a second

1176
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:55,040
factor is something you have

1177
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,799
and a password or something you know

1178
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,640
well i say to that if you know what your

1179
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,480
password is you're an idiot

1180
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,920
you're not using a password manager

1181
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,280
everyone should be using a password

1182
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,839
manager

1183
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,480
and that dragon is never ever going to

1184
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,480
find my door

1185
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:14,480
thank you very much colby okay mike

1186
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,520
you're going to take it up for the

1187
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,800
negative now please

1188
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:23,119
fire a way thank you

1189
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:25,680
sir so young bobby is in school

1190
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,760
his mum and dad regularly review the

1191
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,879
e-safety commissioner's advice

1192
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,800
and supervise bobby's internet play time

1193
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,760
now one of the pieces of advice is to

1194
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,000
enable multi-factor authentication

1195
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,680
on services so bobby's parents have done

1196
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,520
that for facebook or

1197
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:43,279
whatever the heck it is that kids use

1198
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:45,599
these days i've got no idea

1199
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,400
bobby's parents know that a username and

1200
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:48,480
a password

1201
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,760
aren't two different factors because

1202
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,480
they're both pieces

1203
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,760
of text they know that a true second

1204
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,119
factor is a different

1205
00:39:53,760 --> 00:40:00,000
form so here's the problem

1206
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:01,760
collective online view whatever a

1207
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:03,040
collection of online viewers is i don't

1208
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,440
know what the collective noun is for

1209
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,640
that

1210
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,280
we need to start calling it multi-factor

1211
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,560
auth

1212
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:13,760
not 2fa to help all the other citizens

1213
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:15,040
understand how to be safe online thank

1214
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,520

1215

speed debate this year comes now

1219
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,280
far away phil i think the question

1220
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:28,319
doesn't make any sense

1221
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:31,119
2f i've looked up fa final approval

1222

assurance none of these have anything to

1226
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,400
do with user names or passwords or any

1227
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,720
it doesn't come into it

1228
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:43,680

1236
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,359
have

1237
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:02,640
two factors when they're the same thing

1238
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:05,279
admin the username

1239
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:08,078
and admin the password they're one thing

1240
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,079

enabling the webcam is the next step in

1261
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,000
the capture

1262
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:49,760
arms race enabling the webcam is the

1263
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,520
next step in the capture

1264
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,200
arms race jeff eric and mike against

1265
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:56,560
brian david and colby

1266
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,160
take it away please jeff totally it's in

1267
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,759
the arms race look uh yeah i want to

1268
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,520
take you to 20 minutes in the future

1269
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:03,920
i'm not sure but i'm trying to give you

1270
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,480
the idea of the actual head okay

1271
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,240
um that it could actually be deep faked

1272
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,839
okay you've got matt you got there

1273
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:11,279
and then you've got uh the fact that it

1274
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,640
can be totally faked

1275
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,319
if it's going to be on a facial

1276
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:16,319
recognition now if

1277
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,920
if it's a facial recognition it's got to

1278
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:19,119
have some kind of leeway right because

1279
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,319
it has to recognize you when you're

1280
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,240
early in the morning

1281
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,680
late at night when you're happy when

1282
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,200
you're not so happy okay

1283
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,040
when you're up 3 am making slides for

1284
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,040
the next conference anyway um

1285
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,960
have you heard of photographs perhaps

1286
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:33,040
recollecting and making a fake

1287
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,720
head after photographs i'll google that

1288
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:36,480
for you no problems

1289
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,680
gesture recognition perhaps it doesn't

1290
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,640
matter as long as you've got the head

1291
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,560
it's okay

1292
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,799
think of what and isn't it possible for

1293
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,560
to get our pictures from your webcam

1294
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,240
think about it can supervillains

1295
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,359
actually do that i'll give you

1296
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:49,839
you don't have to google that for you

1297
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:53,200
i'll tell you interpreter session

1298

very simple tools we need something more

1311
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,640
complex

1312
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,000
capture lets real people in and keep

1313
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:36,799
spots out

1314
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,880
just like a wall forget all firewalls

1315
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,280

be able to fly over it

1320
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:50,880
my firewall will kill all viruses you

1321
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,319
just inject disinfectant directly into

1322
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,079
the ethernet cable

1323
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:56,560
that's the blue one at the back right

1324
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:57,839
yeah and all viruses are killed

1325
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,640
instantly

1326
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:01,920
remember don't be a chump and put your

1327
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,279
head up your rump

1328
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:07,520
by doing a dump on donald trump

1329
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:10,160
and salute to assert for making security

1330

my friend over to you eric for the

1334
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,920
affirmative

1335
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,680
i like to wonder how he's going to get

1336
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:23,680
that beer over his wall

1337
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:25,520
um so i did some research on this and it

1338
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,720
turns out that capture solves three of

1339
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:29,599
the most important

1340
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:31,279
problems facing humankind today one it

1341
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:32,079
lets us reassure google that we're not

1342
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,920
robots

1343
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:35,280
two it helps google to find all the

1344
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:36,000
buses and the stop signs and the

1345
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:38,319
bicycles and

1346
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:40,160
three most importantly it offers us that

1347
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:41,759
much needed reassurance that we are not

1348
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,359
in these robots

1349
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:44,960
if you're like me then you feel a little

1350
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:47,040
bit of pride each time you pass one of

1351
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:48,720
those i am not a robot tests

1352
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:50,400
the problem is that the way we defeat

1353
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,078
captchas is to configure our bots to

1354
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,240
farm the request to real humans in a

1355
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:54,800
third world using jeff bezos mechanical

1356
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,479
turk

1357
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,160
so now humans are effectively just

1358
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:58,960
supplying training data to artificial

1359
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,720
intelligence

1360
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,240
and in doing so teaching the robots to

1361
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,680
solve these problems themselves

1362
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:05,359
which means that google is becoming

1363
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:07,440
sentient and skynet will be seen

1364
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:08,799
soon able to catalogue all of the fire

1365
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,640
hydrants on its own

1366
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,400
and the only way to stave off this

1367
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:13,759
inevitable future dystopia

1368
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,760
is to peel off that little bit of

1369
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:17,599
electrical tape over your camera pop on

1370
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:18,960
your webcam and complete a series of

1371
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,040
easy activities like

1372
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,160
placing a finger on your nose or winking

1373
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,240
at the webcam

1374
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,680
interspersed with tasks that real humans

1375
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,839
cannot perform such as

1376
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:29,440
licking your elbow or raising both of

1377
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:31,599
your eyebrows independently or

1378
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,160
remembering to turn off zoom hey turn

1379
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:36,960
off your your mute on zoom hey

1380
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,279
okay thank you very much eric to wrap it

1381
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,280
up

1382
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:42,160
for his efforts today david second

1383
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:43,920
speaker for the negative take it away

1384
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:45,200
yeah i'm not convinced that video is the

1385
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,560
next way to go and capture because the

1386
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,680
whole point is something that you just

1387
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,759
can't easily get

1388
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:51,598
a computer to do or can't easily

1389
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,680
outsource videos have done this has

1390
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:55,040
anybody ever seen big man tyrone

1391
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,879
this is a guy who's made millions of

1392
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:59,119
dollars on the simple concept that you

1393
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,800
write a string of characters of words

1394
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,640
and you pay per word and he sends you a

1395
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,920
video of him saying it true story he'll

1396
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,400
even wear a suit or whatever you tell

1397
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,160
him to

1398
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:07,520
and he's made big business out of this

1399
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,319
now you don't think amazon's gonna

1400
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,680
capture

1401
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:11,279
catch on to this you don't think they're

1402
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:12,000
gonna have you know big tyrone as a

1403
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,520
service

1404
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,960
and be able to get whatever video you

1405
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,720
want done i don't think it's going to

1406
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:18,720
scale it's an arms race that you can't

1407
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,160
win definitely not with video

1408
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,919
okay thank you very much for your

1409
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:23,759
evidence today david mike bring it home

1410
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:27,599
for the affirmative please

1411
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,760
thank you sir so young veronica

1412
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,040
loves to go out partying it's been quite

1413
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,240
tough for her these last eight months or

1414
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,839
so because she hasn't been able to do

1415
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,319
that but surely better times are ahead

1416
00:46:33,839 --> 00:46:35,759
anyway

1417
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:37,920
when she goes out to her favorite

1418
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:39,520
nightclub they scan her driver's license

1419
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:41,359
and they take her photo at the door

1420
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,880
but veronica's a good citizen and the

1421
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,839
club's never had to send that data to

1422
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:45,680
the police for anything

1423
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:47,680
so she's quite used to it so when

1424
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,879
veronica signed up for the mailing list

1425
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:50,879
for her

1426
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,480
third sunday of the month book club she

1427
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:54,560
wasn't at all surprised when the page

1428
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:56,880
asked her to pose for her webcam

1429
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:58,400
and prove that she was a real person it

1430
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:02,000
didn't work though

1431
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:06,640
it asked her to try it again and again

1432
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:09,839
eventually she held up a picture of her

1433
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:10,240
her doggy and the ai engine in capture

1434
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:12,319
said

1435
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:14,799
thank you real person detected and all

1436
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:14,800
was well

1437
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:20,800
thank you mike okay to wrap it up for

1438
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:21,440
us all seeking his first win of the

1439
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:24,880
afternoon

1440
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:27,200
take it away colby way to rub it in

1441
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,200
um

1442
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,240
turning on a webcam is definitely not

1443
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:35,440
the next step in the arms race

1444
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:38,078
it's stupid like you in a face i can get

1445
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:42,000
you a face by the end of the afternoon

1446
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:44,160
like it means nothing anyone could do

1447
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,760
anyone behind the screen plus if you've

1448
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,200
been to this conference you'll see about

1449
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,559
half the people here don't even have a

1450
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,919
webcam

1451
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:52,800
and there was to perfectly sum up this

1452
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,520
whole thing

1453
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:59,040
there was a great scholar who once said

1454
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:00,960
this is a total crock of [ __ ]

1455
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,079
thank you very much colby there we have

1456

1458
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:08,319
webcam is the next step

1459
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,279
in the capture arms race do you vote for

1460
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:12,160
the affirmative

1461
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:14,400
jeff eric and mike on the negative brian

1462

1463
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,680
right now our final vote for the day

1464
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,680
this will determine

1465
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:24,079
our winners this afternoon it has been

1466
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:28,439
given to

1467
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:31,760
the negative that's colby

1468

of the uh the air cannon that says

1471
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,960
they're gonna put a zero

1472
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,880
there i'll get that and zoom in there

1473

1476
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,558
colby

1477
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:51,040
got across the line there at the end and

1478
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:53,040
picked up a win congratulations that

1479
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:53,920
means we have out of a possible four

1480
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:58,720
wins

1481
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:58,720
jeff colby

1482
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:06,160
eric all on one

1483
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:07,440
win congratulations add them together

1484
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,558
you still want to have won every debate

1485
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:11,920
that's the way it goes

1486
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:15,200
on two points we have brian mandy

1487
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:18,720
and mike leaving us

1488
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:19,919
on three points a three-way tie between

1489
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:23,118
still

1490
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:24,880
david and phil this is where it falls to

1491
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:25,760
me a very very very difficult decision

1492
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,640
to make

1493
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,440
phil as far as i can recall going back

1494
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,839
over

1495
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,040
the tapes you didn't call me sir once so

1496
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:36,640
you're out my friend

1497
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,960
that leaves us david and uh and uh david

1498
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:40,319
and

1499
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:43,680
phil sorry david and still who were both

1500
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:44,000
yep david didn't really call me sir that

1501
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,399
i can

1502
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,839
