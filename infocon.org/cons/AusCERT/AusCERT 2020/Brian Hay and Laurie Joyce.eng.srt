8
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,520
fantastic

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:23,198
so brian so brian hey apm

10
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,039
has a rare blend of cyber security

11
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,199
skills and business attributes

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,800
not considered a thought leader in the

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,960
world of cyber security

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,360
he learned its craft from non-technical

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,760
demands of how the industry

16
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,880
rather from focusing on the activity of

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,960
crime and

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,320
and for criminals is a very different

19
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,640
point to

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,760
myself for example and then we have lori

21
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,800
as well so laurie's

22
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,280
um got a very long career in

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,640
in information security at around 30

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,600
years or so and 16 years in

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,239
counterterrorism

26
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,680
so i'm sure they'll be very very

27
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:57,120
interesting stories over at beer

28
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,719
sometime

29
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,718
he was the security manager for the

30
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,640
blood service at the time of the data

31
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,640
breach that occurred in 2016

32
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,119
and has been involved in all aspects of

33
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:10,000
the remediation activities that resulted

34
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,360
from the from several security reviews

35
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,400
in its aftermath

36
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,479
as well as development and cyber

37
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,799
security roadmap and strategy

38
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:19,119
uh that continues to evolve as we all

39
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,840
know south security is a

40
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,200
evolving kind of beast and um i'm sure

41
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,479
laurie and brighton are doing a

42
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,000
fantastic job at it so

43
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,080
without further ado i'd like to

44
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,360
introduce the next two speakers who will

45
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,759

46
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,880
cross

47
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,680
blood service and the data breach

48
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,880
uh that they started in 2016 so more of

49
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,240
a case study so thank you very much guys

50
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,759
thanks lucas thank you

now mate um do you realize

52
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,520
that we are probably the oldest two

53
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,840
people and also

54
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,600
yeah yeah you know i bet you by about 10

55
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,520
years

56
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,360
nearly a century and a half between us

57
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,079
how tragic is that okay

58
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,119
so okay we want to talk about the um the

59
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:05,199
australian red cross

60
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,880
blood service data breach now australian

61
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,720
red cross lifeblood

62
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,720
and i think they were going to play a

63
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,680
video for us at the beginning if the

64
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,440
control

65
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,440
console could activate that

66
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,440
firstly can i thank you all very much

67
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,720
for being here today

68
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,120
so why are we here we are here to

69
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:32,239
apologize to our valued donors

70
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,480
for a data security issue as an

71
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,560
organisation we are deeply disappointed

72
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,799
to even be in the position of having to

73
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,560
do this

74
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,959
on the 26th of october we learned

75
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,720
that a file containing donor information

76
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,599
which was located on a development

77
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,359
website was left unsecured by a

78
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:55,040
contracted third party

79
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:58,800
who develops and maintains our website

80
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,959
the issue occurred due to human error

81
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,480
consequently this file was accessed by a

82
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:06,560
person outside of our organisation

83
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,679
this was brought to our attention by oz

84
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:13,120
search our cyber security experts

85
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,879
and advisors who immediately shut down

86
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,480
access to the file as an organization we

87
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,920
are still in the process of completing

88
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,840
our investigation

89
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,839
and we have engaged forensic experts to

90
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,599
help us with this

91
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:29,360
we are also taking guidance from the

92
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,359
australian cyber security centre

93
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,959
the file was a backup of web-based

94
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,959
inquiry forms

95
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,879
that are submitted to donateblood.com.au

96
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,319
and by people making appointments to

97
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,798
give blood

98
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,599
it also included the names of our team

99
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,440
groups

100
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,518
who work together in the team donation

101
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:51,280
programs

102
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:54,480
the backup file contained 550 000

103
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:58,720
people who completed a web form

104
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:01,840
to access a donation between 2010

105
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:03,599
and 2016.

106
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,879
the type of information included in

107
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,280
these files include

108
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:11,200
name address and personal details

109
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,280
personal details that come about from

110
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,879
completing our short questionnaire

111
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,560
which is a bit like a gateway to see

112
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,880
whether people can go ahead to donate

113
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,880
blood

114
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,880
may 26th september 2016 it all evolved

115
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,360
occurred what was your position at this

116
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,360
time with uh red cross

117
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,479
uh i was the ict security compliance

118
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,479
manager um

119
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,599
up until a month before i'd been the

120
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,960
single security block in the

121
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,280
organisation

122
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,000
and we had um one who may even be online

123
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,119
today who

124
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,360
joined shortly before the uh

125
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,040
breach occurred and the team's grown

126
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,160
significantly since then for all sorts

127
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,080
of reasons but we'll get

128
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,639
into that a little bit later on so so

129
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,840
what basically happened

130
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,280
uh well as shelly said um a vendor that

131
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,400
was looking after our website was

132
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,758
setting up a new

133
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,520
uat environment and they took a copy of

134
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,479
the database that was attached

135
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,159
to those um web forms dropped it on a

136
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,758
web facing server

137
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,199
rather than the database server behind

138
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,199
the firewall excuse me you're right

139
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,840
and it sat there um untouched for six

140
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,840
weeks

141
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,119
until the day before on the 25th of

142
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,479
october and look i always say young

143
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,600
bloke in the netherlands but i don't

144
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,719
know whether it was a bloke or

145
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,080
whether he's young or whether he's

146
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,120
actually really in the netherlands but

147
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:34,240
um

148
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,520
someone was uh scanning the the world

149
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,280
wide web for

150
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:43,440
database files and stumbled across it

151
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,679
he then told when he viewed what it was

152
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,840
realised it was australian and got in

153
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:51,360
contact with troy hunter at the time

154
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,679
to tell him about it troy then

155
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,400
uh partially downloaded the the file and

156
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,479
found his own

157
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,919
and his wife's name on it who have both

158
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,318
been blood donors

159
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:02,400
um and then uh set about trying to

160
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,759
contact us to tell us what had happened

161
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,198
um my wife and i were building a new

162
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,160
house so we were we were in rental

163
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,680
premises

164
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:12,240
and i couldn't plug the phone in beside

165
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:14,960
the bed so i was plugged into the uh

166
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,840
um powerpoint in the end i don't know if

167
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,239
we should go into

168
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:22,880
you know i'm not sure what the rating is

169
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,360
i guess the point is mate i um i had

170
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,759
lots of

171
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,039
missed phone calls and messages uh on

172
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,600
that tuesday night and

173
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,599
um thomas king who was with the oscar at

174
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,039
the time was trying to contact me

175
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,880
uh and wasn't able to until the

176
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,440
following morning so

177
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,280
we played a bit of phone tag from about

178
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,719
uh you know

179
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,840
i didn't try and call him at five

180
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,120
o'clock in the morning i waited till it

181
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,280
was seven which is

182
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,560
an hour earlier up in your neck the

183
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,799
woods in brisbane

184
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,160
um and we eventually uh made contact at

185
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,199
nine o'clock on the on the wednesday

186
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,960
morning so

187
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,639
things kicked off in earnest then so i

188
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,080
think it's pretty impressive to me that

189
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,599
you know oscar had a role to play in

190
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,639
this but what i liked is the fact

191
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:03,919
that the if you you sit back and

192
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:06,639
think about it is that the

193
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,318
cyber security community is a global

194
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,840
community that does look after each

195
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,199
other and it's about building that sort

196
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,080
of ecosystem of

197
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,080
of trusted entities and obviously ozcert

198
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,000
were part of that for you

199
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,039
oh absolutely yeah i mean we we've

200
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,479
obviously had a long-standing

201
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,240
relationship with him

202
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,360
um i don't know how thomas did it but he

203
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:27,599
managed to get the uh ip range

204
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,400
blocked on the tuesday night so we we

205
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:31,120
knew at

206
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,400
um on the wednesday morning that there

207
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,919
was no further access

208
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,280
uh able to be gained to the database at

209
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,359
that stage

210
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,719
um what we didn't know at the time was

211
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,800
what it was

212
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,240
i mean shelley said two days later in

213
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,680
the press conference that it was

214
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,520
the web forms but at the time all we

215
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,000
knew was that there was something like

216
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:54,560
1.3 1.4 million lines

217
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,400
on the database of of people um and

218
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,680
uh you know it's that sort of sphincter

219
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,520
moment at the time because you think

220
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,000
that

221
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,960
someone's actually got or gained access

222
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,919
into our network

223
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,840
inside and taken stuff out as it turned

224
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,280
out it wasn't that um

225
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,799
but it took us probably an hour and a

226
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,198
half to two hours to determine that that

227
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,520
was the case on the wednesday morning

228
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,400
so it all goes to it all goes to crap

229
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,479
you've got a

230
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,039
situation that you know you called it

231
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,318
the sphincter moment

232
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,240
you've got to respond you've got to

233
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,520
isolate and contain what were the first

234
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,560
steps you put in place how did the

235
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,479
organization

236
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,759
you and the organization sort of react

237
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:34,479
to this to this news

238
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,120
yeah well i mean obviously we knew that

239
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,959
the um

240
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,640
the database had been taken by at least

241
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:41,199
one person at that stage

242
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,479
and partially by troy as well what we

243
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,360
didn't know was whether it had gotten

244
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:45,440
any further

245
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,440
out so i mean the first thing we did was

246
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,480
set up a war room within the ict

247
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,080
division to

248
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,600
to start to work the problem and

249
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,200
determine

250
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,440
uh the forensics and took us a little

251
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,040
while to work out what had been taken

252
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,640
to start with and the nature of the

253
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,160
information that was contained in the

254
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,560
database

255
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,480
there was also a crisis management team

256
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:08,880
set up a a separate work room

257
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,560
a war room with the executive team

258
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,240
to start working from the other angles

259
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,160
required there's lots of

260
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,760
liaison required with our stakeholders

261
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,040
the national blood authority

262
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,120
various health departments around the

263
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:21,599
country

264
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,320
australian federal police etc et cetera

265
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,600
so

266
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,120
um you know it's not just an ict issue

267
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,120
when these things happen i know

268
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,720
we say that all the time it's a whole of

269
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:32,240
organization issue

270
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,279
um when you do have a breach and you've

271
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,320
got to respond as a whole of

272
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,279
organisation

273
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,480
lots of stuff around um communications

274
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,839
and things and you know

275
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,959
um uh consideration is to if we go

276
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:44,320
public with it and there was

277
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,160
never any thought that we wouldn't go

278
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,959
public and tell people what happened

279
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,519
um but when and how um was the best way

280
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:55,199
to do that was we're all considerations

281
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:58,640
but our one um driving

282
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:00,800
uh i guess tenant was that um

283
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,360
if if people lose trust in us as an

284
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,199
organization people stop giving blood

285
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,040
and the consequences of that is that

286
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,839
people died so

287
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:11,439
you know we we were very concerned about

288
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,399
what impact it would have on the blood

289
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,399
supply so and

290
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,760
and was our driving so reputation

291
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,200
management must have been a critical

292
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,680
issue for you

293
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,640
huge um i said people stop walking in

294
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,599
the door

295
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,199
um consequences that people die and and

296
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,560
you know we needed to manage that

297
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,240
um uh properly as well so um you know

298
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,599
i saw a comment there that was good to

299
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,200
see an apology and

300
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,480
there was never any um consideration

301
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,079
given to the fact that we wouldn't go

302
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,880
public with it we're very conscious of

303
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,519
that

304
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,120
um we have a lot of good will across the

305
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,399
entire community and and we wanted to

306
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,720
maintain that as best

307
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,320
we possibly could um but there was a

308
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:51,519
fear that we didn't know how people

309
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,800
would react so the just to recap

310
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,200
you you've got to respond to the

311
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,120
situation you notify all the all the

312
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,440
senior members of the executive

313
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,120
you establish a war room you're starting

314
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,560
to build strategies around notifying

315
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,320
stakeholders you mentioned that you're

316
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:06,160
starting to look at the forensics just

317
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,920
trying to ascertain get all the

318
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,959
information together to look at

319
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,160
where you are to then ascertain

320
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:16,000
i assume where you want to go now you

321
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,519
didn't know the database so i

322
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,680
i heard something that you actually have

323
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,959
to rebuild start rebuilding the database

324
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,680
so you can actually

325
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,719
get some answers yeah we did we we

326
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,479
didn't know where to come from

327
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,680
originally and once once we determined

328
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,240
that it was

329
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,359
that collection of web forms from from

330
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,600
the website

331
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,279
we then had to understand what um

332
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,480
personally identifiable information may

333
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,399
have been collected in those

334
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,959
those forms and therefore what was

335
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,959
exposed

336
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,600
so look as part of that um we had an

337
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,120
independent risk assessment done

338
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,640
by id care on the nature of the

339
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,240
information um

340
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,800
that assessment came back that there was

341
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,560
a low risk of future direct

342
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,399
harm to people as a result of it and

343
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:59,279
that was largely because

344
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,760
um it might have been only one element

345
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,600
um

346
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,760
associated with the web form so

347
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,519
basically if you wanted to give blood

348
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,120
you could log on to the website at that

349
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,440
stage and you could run through the

350
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,279
eligibility criteria

351
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,480
and and then that would trigger an email

352
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,600
off to our contact center

353
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,200
and they would call you back um

354
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,720
so some of the questions on those

355
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,240
eligibility forms were

356
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,160
you know have you had sex with uh sex

357
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,600
workers in the in the in the previous

358
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,319
few months have you had a tattoo have

359
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,880
you been

360
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,959
unwell what we found out when we

361
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,720
reconstructed the database was that the

362
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:31,199
order of those questions had changed

363
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:35,279
over

364
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:37,760
over time and therefore if you'd said

365
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,000
yes to the fact that you'd been

366
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,120
unwell in the previous two weeks at one

367
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,040
stage uh

368
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,800
it may have meant that you it appeared

369
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:46,959
that you were saying yes to having sex

370
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:52,079
with sex workers for example

371
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:53,760
um so uh when we rebuilt it it looked

372
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,599
like that latter question had a at a

373
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,480
positive response rate of 98

374
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,279
or something ridiculous like that so um

375
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,040
you know it was just uh

376
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,560
but we we had to understand that you

377
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,240
know we had to understand what uh

378
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,160
what people people's details like so

379
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,200
it's awesome so you've mentioned

380
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,000
something before and

381
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:14,240
shelley gave that press release and did

382
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,480
an excellent job two days later

383
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,320
how important was it for you to take

384
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,519
time to plan and prepare before

385
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,880
executing that

386
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,880
public-facing response

387
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,319
uh it was huge like um shelly said uh

388
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,680
with

389
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,560
1.3 million lines of entries on the

390
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,160
database 550 000 unique identities we

391
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,959
had to tell everyone what was going on

392
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,240
and

393
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,079
and lots of the information in that

394
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,920
database was style some of it was up to

395
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,599
sort of eight to ten years old so

396
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,959
um you know people people moved

397
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,560
addresses or

398
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,839
or changed phone numbers or changed

399
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,040
email addresses and so we had to

400
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:50,800
determine um

401
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,160
who we were going to tell and how we

402
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,399
were going to tell them and

403
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,600
and the decision was made that all of

404
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,360
our donors needed to be

405
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,760
notified um and that's a huge exercise

406
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,199
even sending out sms's which which

407
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,399
started as shelley was

408
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:08,800
um was uh giving the press conference

409
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:10,480
um and a limit of sort of seventy

410
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,839
thousand an hour it took us

411
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,680
the best part of twelve hours to get

412
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,959
sms's out to everyone wow

413
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,399
um so we contacted everyone by by sms

414
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,479
those who we had

415
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:23,120
um mobile phone numbers for and and the

416
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:25,600
rest where we had um

417
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:27,040
uh email addresses and obviously went

418
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:28,720
out through our social media to tell

419
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,680
people as well now you and i both know

420
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,920
from our past

421
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,800
lives that when you have a major

422
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,680
incident

423
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,479
the biggest pain in the neck is senior

424
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,638
management

425
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,240
constantly wanting to know what's going

426
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,000
on and insisting upon

427
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,199
sit reps or situation reports and the

428
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,320
like and i'm not saying that happened

429
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:47,359
here but

430
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,639
in our past lives and entitled

431
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,320
everyone who's never done an exercise

432
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,639
mate will know that that's that's an

433
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,959
issue

434
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:54,480
but um look honestly um how did you

435
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,760
manage that though how did you measure

436
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,760
because anyone out there that goes

437
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,760
through a major incident it knows

438
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,760
you must expect that is going to happen

439
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,319
how did you manage it at this time

440
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,760
um we we had the two war rooms set up on

441
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,360
on separate floors

442
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,800
um so there's a lot of going up and down

443
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,240
stairs there's only one floor between us

444
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,279
so it wasn't too bad

445
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,680
um and it's it's a matter of defining

446
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,519
your

447
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,719
your roles and responsibilities quite

448
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,600
clearly

449
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:21,199
right from the get-go so um you have

450
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,639
gophers you need to go for the run run

451
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,160
between the two you need to answer the

452
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,959
questions as they come up

453
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,000
um and you need to be able to give um

454
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,199
sit reps

455
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,720
when they're required so it was it was a

456
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,680
matter having those clearly defined

457
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,040
roles

458
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,199
um look we we'd had um

459
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,199
uh numerous crisis management team

460
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,519
exercises

461
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,639
not necessarily around cyber incidents

462
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,880
but

463
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:49,040
those roles were clearly defined and it

464
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:52,480
worked worked really well

465
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,480
you know i don't think anyone

466
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,839
you don't necessarily have the answers

467
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,040
at your fingertips every time a

468
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,199
question's asked

469
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,279
um but you can go away and find them and

470
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,719
and we made sure that there was that

471
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,399
single point of contact between the

472
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,199
rooms rather than having different

473
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,959
people answered

474
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,800
answer questions at different times so

475
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,920
that that's that's really important when

476
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,880
you're trying to

477
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:15,439
manage a crisis so communications is

478
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,600
critical right in times of crises

479
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,360
yeah and if you reflect back now with a

480
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,959
retrospective sort of view

481
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,639
where you're comfortable that you manage

482
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:26,079
the internal external comms

483
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:28,560
pretty well uh yes we were

484
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,599
and i guess that's been reflected in in

485
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:33,040
uh you know

486
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,759
people using us as a sort of a

487
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,599
a um best practice case study in in

488
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:40,000
terms of how to respond to a crisis

489
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,320
um it's not to say that we didn't make

490
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,040
changes along the way either because

491
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,240
um i touched on that uh risk assessment

492
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,680
we had done

493
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,360
uh independently we didn't want to do it

494
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,839
internally we got an independent person

495
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,600
in the

496
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:55,440
or group to look at um potential impact

497
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,720
of the release of the information

498
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:02,560
um but even there uh

499
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,880
it became evident so we had on on the um

500
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,760
after friday so the the communications

501
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,439
team

502
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,039
uh were managing social media

503
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,640
we we had a number of scripts already

504
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,879
written for people to

505
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,919
to give back um if people ring in with

506
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,799
questions

507
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:20,160
um but overnight on the friday night by

508
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,879
the time we came back in on saturday

509
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,240
morning

510
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,480
we had around about three thousand

511
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,240
inquiries that we had to respond to

512
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,240
um so we had to go back to the drawing

513
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,520
board there too

514
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,960
understanding them what people's

515
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,879
concerns were and the types of questions

516
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,320
that were coming we went back and and

517
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,360
recreated the scripts so that our

518
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,399
contact center

519
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:40,159
had stuff that they could tell people um

520
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,000
it also became evident that whilst there

521
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,679
was some low risk

522
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,000
information for many people there are

523
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,919
certain classes or cohorts of people for

524
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,200
for which that information is is is

525
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:51,760
really critical

526
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,400
um law enforcement uh defence force

527
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,440
personnel

528
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,440
and what their address is out in the

529
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:58,880
public um so

530
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,440
so we had to then uh put a a strategy in

531
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:04,400
place where we could handle those people

532
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,679
separately if if required and um and and

533
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,360
these are the issues of course if you

534
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,799
have lose information the data breach

535
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,000
you've got to think multiple wise well

536
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,760
whose information is

537
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,160
what are those impacts on those them as

538
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,840
persons and as individuals and

539
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,440
of course not just their organizations

540
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,678
now you must have been

541
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,480
and the team everyone is going a

542
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,120
critical mass

543
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,520
a thousand mile an hour the hours must

544
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,840
have been

545
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,120
long and arduous how how would you

546
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,959
recommend some what

547
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,479
would your advice be to others that go

548
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:33,600
through this scenario

549
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,799
just to cope from a personal perspective

550
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,439
yeah when everyone wants to work the

551
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,799
room

552
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,160
you know you you don't want to go home

553
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,080
and go to sleep you want to you want to

554
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,160
see it through to it to the end but

555
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,439
obviously there are long hours those

556
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,559
first few days

557
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,799
whilst we're trying to pull stuff

558
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:50,799
together and understand uh how

559
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,799
how widely the data may have been

560
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:55,679
released and who else had access to it

561
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,799
um so they were long hours but you've

562
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,400
got to manage your team

563
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:00,000
properly you've got to you've got to

564
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,760
make sure um

565
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,120
if someone's been there for 8 or 10

566
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,919
hours tap them on the shoulder and say

567
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,439
go home yeah

568
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,120
and have someone else ready to step into

569
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,120
their shoes so um

570
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:11,360
that's really important because fatigue

571
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:13,760
over a number of days does sit in

572
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,280
um you don't make good decisions when

573
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,559
you're fatigued

574
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,399
so you got to make sure that you've got

575
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:20,879
the right people on

576
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,400
on the floor that can make proper

577
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,760
decisions and

578
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,520
and do the stuff that needs to be done

579
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:28,480
without being too tired how did this

580
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,960
affect staff morale

581
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,960
look um

582
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:35,520
there wasn't a great effect on staff

583
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:38,880
morale at all i mean one of the

584
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,879
one of the things that we were really

585
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,799
really wanted to make sure was that

586
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,320
stuff didn't leak before we were ready

587
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:47,918
to go public with it

588
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:50,159
and and everyone across the two floors

589
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,000
knew something was going on

590
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,760
but no one knew other than those that

591
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,559
were actually working the problem

592
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,360
uh knew knew what it was about so um i i

593
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,280
was really

594
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:01,039
proud of everyone for that for keeping

595
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,080
it uh close to the chest and

596
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:05,440
and um that was a really important thing

597
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,799
because we did we didn't want to lose

598
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,600
control of it either

599
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:11,440
we had to make sure that um given that

600
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:14,639
our concerns about the blood supply

601
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,039
that we were able to um release it at a

602
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,960
time

603
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,799
and with the right information to tell

604
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,280
people to um

605
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,879
sure you're the security manager you

606
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,918
just have an incident

607
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,600
and you know it's a lot of pressure

608
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:29,840
did it ever go through your mind that

609
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,199
your job could be on the line

610
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:36,158
oh it does yeah i mean um i've been safe

611
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,679
from a previous role mate so

612
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:39,280
at the top of my game too almighty but

613
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:41,440
that's another story for another day

614
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,440
um

615
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:48,240
you can google me you'll find out what

616
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,840
it's about look

617
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,720
uh yes it does um

618
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:57,120
but it it wasn't a real fear and a real

619
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,919
fear in the sense that my job was ever

620
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,678
under any any real threat um we had

621
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,120
tremendous support and not just me but

622
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:05,600
the entire team

623
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,280
from the executive and the board um

624
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,399
that's it actually if i could interrupt

625
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,799
you on that point

626
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,080
and i'm going to we own we only have 13

627
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,039
minutes left so i'm going to belt you

628
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,799
around the ears a little bit

629
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:18,640
it's gone so um you just mentioned that

630
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,559
you had great support by the executive

631
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,480
management now from a

632
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:23,918
position where you're going forward to

633
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,960
trying to get through

634
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:30,320
strategies budget resources

635
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:32,240
did it change the attitude of executive

636
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,918
management sort of take cyber security a

637
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,960
little bit more serious uh

638
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:38,400
after this well look we we had a new

639
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,840
chief executive and a new chairman of

640
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,000
the board that had arrived within

641
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,000
within the previous six months and there

642
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,400
was already a greater focus on

643
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,000
on security you know we had a had a

644
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,360
budget we had a security improvement

645
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,880
program that was underway and had been

646
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:53,918
going for a couple of years

647
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:55,360
um this accelerated things enormously

648
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,960
you know we didn't have a team that

649
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,479
could do everything that was needed to

650
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,720
be done so we had to ramp up

651
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,600
quite significantly and we had probably

652
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,960
about an extra 20 people at a time to

653
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,399
actually start to

654
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,960
to do some of the things that were

655
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,679
required to be done now

656
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,360
this was a third-party breach but the

657
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,039
board was very keen to ensure that

658
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,879
everything we had in place internally

659
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:18,559
was robust enough to protect us

660
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,640
as much as we possibly can get be

661
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:22,559
protected so there were a number of

662
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,760
reviews that were started and they they

663
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:26,720
commenced

664
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,120
um on the monday after the the event

665
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,000
where

666
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,840
we um we had our internal auditors in to

667
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,400
to do a review of the incident itself

668
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,039
and how we

669
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,039
had handled that um and that was uh

670
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,640
nursing young we had pwc come in and do

671
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,240
a review of um

672
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,840
end-to-end review of security so they

673
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,120
looked at everything from policies and

674
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,199
processes through

675
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,559
the tool sets we had the the bums we had

676
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,880
on seat

677
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,840
um and of course the private

678
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,640
commissioner also launched an

679
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,360
investigation

680
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,240
uh a month or so later so on that point

681
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,320
let's just

682
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:59,679
if we can 30 seconds on it how much of

683
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:03,280
an impact was the privacy commissioner

684
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,720
um i i guess the the main impact was on

685
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,840
the enforceable undertaking and what

686
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:09,120
what we needed to do

687
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:10,959
to satisfy that and and we were we were

688
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,360
criticized for two points one was we

689
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:15,840
kept information beyond its use by date

690
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,039
um so those web forms once they the

691
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,158
email been triggered to the contact

692
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:19,600
center there's no need to keep the

693
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,919
information anymore

694
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,360
um and the second part was on our vendor

695
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:24,159
management because this was a

696
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,639
third-party

697
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,600
breach effectively um so we had to put

698
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,360
things in place

699
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,639
uh subsequent to that to make sure that

700
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,240
we we do

701
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:34,080
uh regular information security

702
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,600
assessments on the vendors that are

703
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,000
managing stuff on our behalf

704
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,879
in fear of isolating and annoying all

705
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,760
the vendors

706
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,880
bender management how was it an

707
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,440
advantage or a

708
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,960
pain in the neck during this process

709
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,240
would did you have vendors saying hey

710
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,640
listen you've had a breach we can help

711
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,559
you

712
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,840
we've got this amazing product it's

713
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,520
actually going to do everything for you

714
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,399
it's going to increase your iq

715
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,639
improve you know the color of your hair

716
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,360
yeah

717
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,559
two parts firstly um we had tremendous

718
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,799
support from precedent

719
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,678
with a company that that were breached

720
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:07,279
um they

721
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:09,039
they had nothing from us they gave us

722
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,600
all the support we

723
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:13,120
were required to do the investigation

724
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,520
and make sure that uh you know

725
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,799
we knew what had happened um but yeah i

726
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,960
mean the phone rings off the hook

727
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,840
yeah did you find that a little bit of

728
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,039
offensive because hang on

729
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,399
i don't want to be annoyed with this

730
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,679
i've got a critical insulin we've got to

731
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,960
manage and you're trying to sell me

732
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:30,320
something

733
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:31,520
no i didn't because we had to work our

734
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,799
contacts anyway to get

735
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,520
get some of the the um stuff that we

736
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,960
needed

737
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,720
done i mean we didn't have forensic

738
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,320
experts on staff so

739
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,799
you know i had to engage with someone

740
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,960
who had a previous relationship with

741
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,320
to do the analysis of the of the web

742
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,360
server and find out how many times it

743
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,879
had been touched and

744
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,639
and who got hold of it um which

745
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,880
incidentally we haven't touched on but

746
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,480
there was only those two two occasions

747
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,799
so it sat there for six months

748
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,000
uh six six weeks without being touched

749
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,879
at all and then our friend in the

750
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,320
netherlands

751
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,679
and troy were the only two people that

752
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,559
had actually downloaded and that would

753
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:07,840
have been a hell of a relief

754
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,760
absolutely um uh and whilst we we took

755
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,039
their word for that um we got an unknown

756
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,400
person in the netherlands telling us

757
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:16,400
that he deleted the database um

758
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,159
he saw himself as a bit of a white hat

759
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,720
that wanted to

760
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,600
build a bit of a reputation of his own

761
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,039
as a good guy

762
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:27,120
and we then had to put in place some

763
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:28,799
dark web monitoring to make sure that it

764
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:31,520
didn't pop up elsewhere the

765
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,879
unknown boxes so i mean so again we

766
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,080
didn't have on staff we needed to be

767
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,520
able to engage with people

768
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,879
so obviously intelligence and bringing

769
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,639
that critical mass of the right

770
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,640
information to us aid in the

771
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,240
critical decision-making process was

772
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,520
something that was

773
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,559
would have been so important to you at

774
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:49,440
the time yeah absolutely i said um

775
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:51,918
you know we we were taking people at the

776
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,600
word to a degree

777
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,279
but you still need to be able to to

778
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:57,918
ensure that what they're telling you is

779
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,520
is right as much as possible and you

780
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:03,360
know what it's like i mean

781
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:03,840
um this data when it when when it is

782
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,678
taken

783
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:11,199
has most value as soon as it's taken

784
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:14,000
so as it ages it has less value so

785
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,200
um if someone does exfoliate information

786
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,880
from anyone they're going to want to get

787
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,840
it on the on the dark market as soon as

788
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:19,200
possible and

789
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,279
and sell it as soon as possible before

790
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,919
it gets replicated and sin

791
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:24,799
the value decreases we've got eight

792
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,679
minutes left

793
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:29,279
and i want to focus most of this time on

794
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,080
lessons learned

795
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:33,840
um what were some of the key lessons

796
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,720
reflecting back going through that that

797
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:40,559
you would share or provide advice to

798
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,559
our participants listening on this

799
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,240
um well obviously you need support or

800
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,480
you bought an executive team and

801
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,760
and that's critical it has to be uh top

802
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,440
down support um

803
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,879
and we were very lucky and still have

804
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,559
that um

805
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,919
still doing quite you know quite a lot

806
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,440
of investment into

807
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:59,760
uh security across the board as well um

808
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,760
get control of your shadow i.t and we

809
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:05,039
say that time and time and time again we

810
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,440
didn't know that database even existed

811
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,640
we previously had a uh an on staff

812
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,640
webmaster who

813
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,679
who knew all that stuff and they were

814
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,279
made redundant and we

815
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,720
were replaced a few years prior to the

816
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,799
event um

817
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,240
so you know we put controls in place now

818
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,440
that uh we know

819
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,679
where stuff flows out of the

820
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:23,679
organization who's got got hold of it

821
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,640
review your cyber security or cyber

822
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:31,039
incident response plans regularly in

823
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,720
your crisis management plans

824
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:33,919
exercise exercise exercise you make

825
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,320
mistakes in an exercise it doesn't

826
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:38,720
matter at the end of the day

827
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,879
and another point to that which we've

828
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,240
talked about many times before brian is

829
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,600
is you need to understand your threat

830
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,960
environment as well so you need to

831
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,840
understand

832
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,600
who who may want to attack you and why

833
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,600
and what those attack vectors are

834
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,959
and then exercise appropriately with

835
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,080
with that in mind

836
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,039
um manager vendors we've got a situation

837
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:59,120
in place now where

838
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,080
we do biennial assessments of of

839
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,120
everyone who

840
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,279
who handles pii um

841
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,120
uh or or we bring that forward in the

842
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,279
event that a contract's up for a

843
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:10,879
renewal or there's been some incident

844
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,919
associated with them or the industry

845
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,640
they work in

846
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,360
um so you've got to do that and you know

847
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,799
um

848
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,479
privacy commissioner expects that from

849
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,760
everyone as well yeah

850
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,919
um so as part of that you need to know

851
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,158
what the privacy commissioner says is

852
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,240
reasonable steps in managing vendors and

853
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,760
and protecting that private information

854
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,799
as well could we extend that term

855
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,960
managing vendors to

856
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:35,360
because i'm a big advocate of uh

857
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,840
communities of trust and ecosystems of

858
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,158
trust

859
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:40,000
so and using that vendor network because

860
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,080
i've got access to the latest global

861
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,480
intelligence i've got incredible tools

862
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:46,080
skill sets such as forensics do you find

863
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,360
bringing some of them in that you trust

864
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,879
and actually make them part of the

865
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,879
solution which was critical to your

866
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:54,080
success

867
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,760
uh yes it was uh look i think um

868
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,360
uh the environment in australia has

869
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,399
changed a lot in that four years as well

870
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,158
um

871
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,520
so the australian cyber security centers

872
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,720
and the joint cyber security

873
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,879
centers around the country now they've

874
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,480
been set up are doing a great job in

875
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,000
bringing people together

876
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,159
i think we've still got a long way to go

877
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,880
in in setting up those trusted

878
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:15,279
information sharing networks

879
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,399
some verticals do it better than others

880
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,360
you know the banks have been doing it

881
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,760
for years

882
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:21,918
and doing a really good job of it health

883
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:26,399
is still way behind because there's

884
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:29,360
there's a um a difference between

885
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:30,799
public health um institutions big big

886
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,760
public hospitals and stuff like that in

887
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,279
the private

888
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:36,480
uh health networks and things like that

889
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,039
too lack of sharing information between

890
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,000
them is

891
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:41,120
is still a problem in my view but uh is

892
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,960
getting better

893
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,399
um and i think the uh the federal

894
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,840
government response to

895
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,439
you know the latest strategy that

896
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,240
they've put out um

897
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:51,919
does put a big um focus on on being able

898
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,320
to share that intelligence and

899
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,679
and share that information you know

900
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,039
nothing beats being able to pick up a

901
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:58,880
phone and talk to someone about stuff

902
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,960
absolutely

903
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,240
how response ready was the business when

904
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,840
you reflect now

905
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,760
compared to how you would be ready now

906
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:08,000
how back then

907
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,960
how response ready was the business look

908
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,399
i thought i

909
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:14,159
think we did pretty well um uh we

910
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,678
we are much better now i might have much

911
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:18,880
more capability in in

912
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:22,080
um in i guess

913
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,360
having incidents flagged earlier

914
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,439
you know that sat there for six weeks

915
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,959
without us knowing about it um if the

916
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:28,320
guy in the netherlands hadn't found it

917
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:32,399
we probably still

918
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:35,760
could be sitting out there today um so

919
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:39,678
how important is people and culture

920
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:41,200
huge huge um uh if if people don't

921
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:42,559
understand where they're likely to get

922
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,480
targeted

923
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:45,918
um they're gonna get targeted and

924
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,600
stuff's gonna leak out

925
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,440
um they're gonna keep click on bad links

926
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:53,360
in emails they're gonna be fished

927
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:54,960
um so i mean we've got a huge as you

928
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,279
well know brian you you're working with

929
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:59,360
us on it um now we've got a huge uh

930
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:02,559
emphasis on being able to upskill our

931
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:05,360
people in recognizing threats

932
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:05,760
when they occur now and and and having

933
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,240
the

934
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,600
the not so much the courage but the the

935
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,440
um

936
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,279
the desire to actually report them when

937
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,720
they see bad stuff so

938
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,720
we've done a lot of work in that space

939
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,000
still a lot a lot more to

940
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,480
do but um has to be a huge focus for

941
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,840
everyone

942
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,519
mate i'm going we've only got a couple

943
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:25,600
of minutes left and i want to

944
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,039
just change course for a moment and just

945
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,918
you know if someone wanted to ask a

946
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,960
question at the

947
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:32,320
the end that would be great but a very

948
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,000
important question is how are

949
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:36,240
australia's blood stocks holding up

950
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,240
today

951
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:43,600
ah look um we're at our highest levels

952
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:47,200
uh since about 2007 i think um

953
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,719
even with covert and so uh look we've

954
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,480
got a lot of great

955
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,399
uh goodwill that we've built up over the

956
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,760
years with with our donors and there's

957
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:57,199
probably many of them

958
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:59,279
in the room today as well so um

959
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,880
it's really important that people uh

960
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:03,919
still put their hand up and give blood

961
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,440
um lifeblood's business has changed

962
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:07,279
enormously over the last few years as

963
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,559
well a huge emphasis on on

964
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:11,600
on plasma collections now um moved into

965
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,840
milk making and

966
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:15,439
organ donation and poo banking is coming

967
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:19,039
up shortly so

968
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:19,039
keep your eye out for that um

969
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:27,679
um gut microbiome

970
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,918
different different yeah

971
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,720
yeah so um so anyone out there who's

972
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,519
never made a

973
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,080
blood donation please think about doing

974
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,519
it and

975
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,760
and making that contribution to this

976
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,399
australian country absolutely

977
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:42,240
um you know like like with many

978
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,199
organizations with the supply chain

979
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,200
issues now we

980
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,039
we still import a bit of our plasma we'd

981
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,120
like to get to the stage where

982
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,720
um that's not necessary and we're moving

983
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,799
towards that we've got uh

984
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:54,480
discussions with government about how

985
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,879
that might occur over the next few years

986
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,279
but

987
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,080
you look um we had a free kick with this

988
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:00,559
data breach

989
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,600
um we didn't see a drop off in in blood

990
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,080
supply

991
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,199
um we don't want another one because we

992
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:07,199
don't want to see it happen but

993
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,240
i told me if it's true i heard a rumor

994
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,640
that you

995
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:12,000
folk you and the team and the executive

996
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:14,480
at australian red cross

997
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,480
now lifeblood did such an amazing job

998
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,600
you increased your donor numbers

999
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:21,519
post the event

1000
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,519
yeah look it's interesting it's the same

1001
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,679
that happens with most um

1002
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,760
natural disasters and stuff too we do

1003
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:29,919
get an influx of people that

1004
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,760
want to put their hand up and and and

1005
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:33,440
give i said

1006
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,879
our donor panel now is higher than it's

1007
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,880
been for you know

1008
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,000
more than a decade so we're really

1009
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,159
grateful to everyone

1010
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:43,039
who who is uh giving blood and continues

1011
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:45,760
to do that on a regular basis so

1012
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,799
but just on behalf of the queensland

to how important it is and

1023
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,519
i'd encourage everyone out there if you

1025
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,040
contribution

of your blood please do so because it is

1027

life-changing and it's life-saving

1028
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:18,399
but in the ever-growing complexity of of

1029
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:20,159
the of cyber crime and that's how it

1030
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,679
becomes more sophisticated with the

1031
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,280
driving of organized crime nation

1032
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,040
sponsored attacks

1033
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,560
what you've shared with us today is the

1034
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,079
insight of how we need to be more

1035
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,759
resilient how we need to build those

1036
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,720
trusted ecosystems how we need to

1037
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:33,119
actually

1038
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:35,118
fully appreciate the threat of the

1039
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:37,200
attack that it is real and it can happen

1040
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:39,119
accidentally as it did with you

1041
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,719
and forthright and honest and and

1042
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,119
transparent in your response and you're

1043
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,879
not

1044
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,560
australians have a great capacity to

1045
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,480
understand and forgive and

1046
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,599
uh some of the lessons i took from you

1047
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,800
is you know

1048
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:53,440
that um the third party processing

1049
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,159
the get understanding your partnership

1050
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,918
with the

1051
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,320
privacy commissioner and understanding

1052
00:34:55,918 --> 00:35:01,440
what is required and how you can improve

1053
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:02,400
um so thank you so much for your time

1054
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,480
and the

1055
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,760
preparedness of australian red cross

1056
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,440
lifeblood to

1057
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:09,359
be full and frankie today and share it

1058
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,760
so i'm just i'm going to hand

1059
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,960
over the last words to you to say this

1060
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,160
if there was something you just want to

1061
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,560
tell the audience what they should do

1062
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,560
that'd be great

1063
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,920
well look the the final thing is don't

1064
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,680
leave it till you have a breach to

1065
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,800
understand what resources you may

1066
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,720
require

1067
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,839
so you know we don't all have people

1068
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,399
sitting around twittering their thumbs

1069
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:28,640
waiting for

1070
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,920
these things to happen so you need to

1071
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,118
build relationships with other

1072
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,800
organizations

1073
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:34,800
but you call on the event that something

1074
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,520
does go wrong and you need them and do

1075
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,280
it early

1076
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:38,560
well thank you very much lori really

1077
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,880
appreciate it

1078
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,320
you lucas thanks brother thank you brian

1079
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,839
and laurie that was absolutely fantastic

1080
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,680
i really enjoyed hearing the candid

1081
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:47,359
conversation around data breaches and

1082
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,720
thank you very much for being so open

1083
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:50,560
and honest about

1084
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,240
some of the some of the issues and some

1085
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:53,599
of the concerns that you had during it

1086
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:55,040
there were a number of questions

1087
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:56,480
unfortunately we don't have enough time

1088
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,119
because we're going to move into lunch

1089
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,400
now

1090
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,839
but um i'll i will kind of ask

1091
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,079
one question that kind of got the most

1092
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,759
updates it was around having a ir plan

1093
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,839
or playbook covering this this

1094
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,440
kind of scenario was that was that in

1095
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:11,520
place prior to the breach

1096
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,760
and also is that in place potentially

1097
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:15,599
now as a result

1098
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,119
uh it is it is in place now we've got

1099
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,079
playbooks around a number of different

1100
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:21,440
scenarios

1101
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:24,320
you know data breach ransomware

1102
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:25,359
phishing exercise all sorts of things so

1103
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,960
but the key is

1104
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,799
understand your threats and make sure

1105
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,119
that your playbooks are up to date

1106
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,680
and change as required because i think

1107
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:36,800
you know threats change all the time

1108
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,839
absolutely um right so there were a few

1109
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,400
other questions so

1110
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:41,759
