1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,240
all right folks sorry about that

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,400
i am back and i'm going to have to do

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,840
this without slides because technology

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,880
just doesn't like me today

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,920
uh it is actually 10 36 here in the pm

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,880
in canada

7
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,960
so hello from canada my name is dave

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,799
lewis i am a global advisory cso with

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,840
dual security which is now part of cisco

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,800
systems

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,560
and with the security field being what

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,400
it is i mean i have been very fortunate

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,400
that i have had all sorts of different

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,159
roles over the course of years

15
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,680
and along the lines i've learned a lot

16
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,879
of lessons

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,640
one of them is learning how to do a

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,239
presentation without my slide deck and

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,360
yes i will make these slides available

20
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,199
afterwards

21
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,960
so first and foremost how we see

22
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,800
ourselves is we see ourselves in the

23
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,920
security profession in many ways as a

24
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,440
superhero

25
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,960
and the idea here is we are champions

26
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,599
for protecting our environments

27
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,239
protecting

28
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,879
our families protecting people at large

29
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,078
and

30
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,000
we tend not to look at things

31
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,440
quite the same way now for obvious

32
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,600
reasons where

33
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,199
what we used to see as our adversary has

34
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,640
sort of morphed where we're now working

35
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,158
from home and we have to deal with our

36
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,080
kids crawling all over us and all sort

37
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,760
of interesting things like that

38
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,200
and it's really made things very

39
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,680
interesting

40
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,200
so with the idea here of we can be zero

41
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,520
trust heroes is

42
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,520
an interesting notion in that or that we

43
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,200
are all zero zero test heroes is that we

44
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,439
are all contributing

45
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,960
to this and in a lot to a large extent

46
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,600
be by virtue of the way we are

47
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,240
protecting our organizations

48
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,360
but no security story is good without an

49
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,839
origin story

50
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,680
um and much like any hero we always hear

51
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,680
about the origin story so if we go back

52
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,960
in time we look at different types of

53
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,520
malicious software that we've had to

54
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,798
contin

55
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,920
contend with as defenders from brain in

56
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,159
1986

57
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,159
right through to uh the computer aids

58
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,079
virus which was actually a cd that was

59
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,079
delivered and then you had to send cash

60
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,798
i think it was 189 dollars to

61
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,479
a po box somewhere in the united states

62
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,320
and then jumping through 206 with

63
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,479
archivists and then fake av

64
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,600
wind lockers crydex and crypto locker

65
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,360
and so on

66
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,439
and there's been no shortage of

67
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,280
malicious software that has gone along

68
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,359
the way

69
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,800
and then we got into you know the

70
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,480
2014-2015 era of dealing with drydex and

71
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,319
dealing with this where it was stealing

72
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,359
information from your system from

73
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,799
screenshots and injections and form

74
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,720
grabbing and things like this all of

75
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,200
this was heavily using

76
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,520
um you know leveraging the account of

77
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:31,760
the user that was logged in

78
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,920
now we jump into 2016 we go right

79
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,679
through and we look at how drydex

80
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,079
actually accounted for roughly 50

81
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,200
of all financial ransomware so we've

82
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,760
gone from the

83
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,040
the aids virus such that it was back in

84
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,720
1989 and

85
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,560
with the cd being distributed and you

86
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,720
had to put that in and send money

87
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,480
to drynex which was actually doing this

88
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,879
as a service

89
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,079
by may 2016 as for the fbi they was

90
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,920
dealing with about a hundred thousand

91
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,000
attacks a day and infecting roughly you

92
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,079
know three to five thousand computers

93
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,920
and this really started racking up the

94
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,040
cost you know 10 million in estimated

95
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,799
losses at that point in time

96
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,040
so as a defender what are you to do

97
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,920
well we have to look at the different

98
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,079
types of things

99
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,760
that we can do in order to better

100
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,040
protect our environments

101
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,640
when we're dealing with things like

102
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,239
email phishing and social engineering

103
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,920
which the attackers will use in order to

104
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,519
gain access to your systems

105
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,119
the attacks of we once had the one where

106
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,799
it's like oh yes you send your money to

107
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,080
a po box and yes

108
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,000
we'll make everything all right but

109
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,599
we'll send you the key to now

110
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,120
where you actually have to spend a

111
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,079
certain amount of bitcoin and hopefully

112
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,760
you'll get a key that'll

113
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,599
unlock your system but if you wait long

114
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,120
enough you can usually get the key

115
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,159
provided to you through one of the good

116
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,840
certs out there

117
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,079
or a researcher that is of a positive

118
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,599
bent

119
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,280
now these applications will try

120
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,679
primarily target local apps for the most

121
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,920
part

122
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,840
which are usually slower to patch and

123
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,399
the attacks will go far and wide with

124
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,120
more and more access problems

125
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:01,280
and the risk is evolving when we look at

126
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,439
it in various types of reports like

127
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,760
the dbir and so on where we're looking

128
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,000
at you know the users and the devices

129
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,359
and how they are being breached

130
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,360
most of the data breaches according to

131
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,120
the latest dbir was 81

132
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:15,439
of the breaches involved compromise

133
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,880
credentials now for devices we were

134
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,959
looking at about 70

135
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,320
of devices involved in data breaches

136
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,960
were compromised

137
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,759
and this was um this is a number that

138
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:27,440
stays relatively high year over year

139
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,000
so how are we going to do a better job

140
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,400
of this well we have to look at other

141
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,639
things

142
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,599
other ways of doing authentication

143
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,759
passwords are

144
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,880
something that really tend to complicate

145
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,160
matters

146
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,479
in many many ways we've been dealing

147
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,560
with passwords since about 1962 when

148
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,400
mit rolled them out for one of their

149
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,000
applications there in order to protect a

150
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,679
student's compute time

151
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:54,240
and this has

152
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,600
really been something that should have

153
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,840
just been a temporary

154
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,360
measure and i'm sure that you're going

155
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,198
to love my cat dancing in the background

156
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,039
so i apologize for that i didn't think i

157
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,360
had him in the room

158
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,479
but as we're going along we have to look

159
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,400
at a better way to do things so we're

160
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,240
moving away from passwords to

161
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,440
biometrics we're looking for push

162
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,000
technology

163
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:15,199
using wearables or biometrics or

164
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,440
hardware tokens

165
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:18,320
there are all sorts of ways to do things

166
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,600
better

167
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,759
and when you're doing this you want to

168
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,680
make sure that you are having a solution

169
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,560
and a zero trust solution that is

170
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,000
where you are protecting your system um

171
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,160
using

172
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,759
that something that will check your os

173
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,039
level on your system you're taking the

174
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,520
patching checking the current

175
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:36,960
uh you know is the face id enabled is

176
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,680
there a screen lock

177
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,280
because this is where we need to start

178
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,759
going we have to do a better job of

179
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:46,880
securing our mobile devices

180
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:48,400
so question for you if i went around the

181
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,080
virtual room and i can't really tell how

182
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,440
many people are in here right now

183
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,199
but if i went around the room and i

184
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,280
asked everyone what is love

185
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:57,280
i can guarantee you i'll get a different

186
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,479
answer from every single person

187
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,198
zero trust has really evolved into that

188
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,919
as a as a way of looking at it because

189
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,479
people have

190
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:08,479
different answers for that the idea here

191
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,758
is zero trust is about reducing risk in

192
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,359
your organization

193
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,880
and with any organization where you're

194
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:14,400
dealing in a certain type of effects you

195
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,319
you really want to look at how you can

196
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,960
reduce the risk you have to deal with

197
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,000
less fires to put out and when you're

198
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,599
looking at zero trust you're

199
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,919
dealing with you know everything is on

200
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,919
fire

201
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,880
and i'm glad to see that your kitten is

202
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,840
now tapping the screen this is actually

203
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,919
kind of cool

204
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,400
um i wish i could say i trained him to

205
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,799
do that but he's just jumping in

206
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,239
so when we look at zero tests the idea

207
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,960
here is that everything's on fire

208
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,680
everything

209
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,440
is a point of contention we want to make

210
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,400
sure that we are securing our

211
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,560
environment

212
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,318
in a way that you only granting access

213
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,720
where it's absolutely needed

214
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,880
because things are going to go wrong

215
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,240
necessarily always a malicious actor

216
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,560
sometimes it's a case of

217
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,599
code that worked well in pr and

218
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,080
development

219
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,400
didn't go well into production that that

220
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,400
happens far too often

221
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,159
as a security practitioner we often feel

222
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,758
like we are sitting on a chair

223
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,280
being rocketed across in front of a

224
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,960
moving train and this is a real

225
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,239
frustration

226
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:13,280
so back in about 2003 2004 we were

227
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,199
dealing with

228
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,280
a paper that was put out by the jericho

229
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,880
forum now this particular paper we

230
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,479
talked about deep perimeterization

231
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,800
this was really the forerunner to what

232
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,800
was later called zero trust and that was

233
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,319
a term coined by an analyst at forrester

234
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,560
in 2010

235
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,319
and i have a lot of conversations with

236
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,560
cso roundtables about this

237
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,400
and more often than not they say oh this

238
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,400
is just a buzzword

239
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,318
yes and no it's a buzzword in that it

240
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,318
got people to pay attention

241
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:41,680
but zero trust is about reducing risk

242
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,960
and getting back to dealing with the

243
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,319
core fundamentals

244
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,239
now i can't stop looking at my cat geez

245
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:50,080
and we go through time we look at there

246
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,440
are better ways to do things as we go

247
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:54,159
through it and because the i.t

248
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,759
landscape has shifted and it's even more

249
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,080
prevalent in this current age

250
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,280
with the pandemic where almost every

251
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,359
company out there in the world

252
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,679
has some sort of a remote workforce in

253
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,240
some capacity

254
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,879
we have to look at from a zero trust

255
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,400
perspective

256
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,479
we have to look at we're enabling

257
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,479
multi-cloud access as an example

258
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,159
we have to enable byod because there are

259
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,599
systems out there system sorry companies

260
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,360
out there that just didn't have the

261
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,319
hardware available to them

262
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,120
in order to supply their staff to be

263
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,280
remote

264
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,319
i spoke with one company in southeast

265
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,159
asia

266
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,599
he literally didn't have enough laptops

267
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,759
for their call center so they took

268
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,318
all the desktops off the desk and sent

269
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,318
the mother

270
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,440
out there and sent them and sent them on

271
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,519
with them

272
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,039
so the idea here is really about breach

273
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,599
prevention we want to make sure that

274
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,080
copper

275
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,919
compromised credentials are not a

276
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,760
currency and we have to take that away

277
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:47,680
from them

278
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,200
yes if i can train the cat i can tame my

279
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:52,079
network that's a good point

280
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,959
um and and phishing is a real problem as

281
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,640
well because

282
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,079
if we look at it from the perspective of

283
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,120
something as simple as multi-factor

284
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,360
authentication

285
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,240
we're then nullifying so many of these

286
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,839
attacks where

287
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,360
the attacker will try to breach a

288
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,720
website as an example they get user

289
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,160
names and passwords but if they can't

290
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,920
get the other factors

291
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,279
they're not going to be able to leverage

292
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,519
that for their own

293
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,320
end so we used to look at the

294
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,839
traditional

295
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,360
perimeter as i have a firewall

296
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,760
everything is fine

297
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,040
well let's be honest everything was not

298
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,279
fine and

299
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,360
we have to switch to talking about it

300
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,600
from a zero trust perspective where

301
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,399
anywhere an access decision is being

302
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,640
made

303
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,640
is where our perimeter is today

304
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:35,200
when we want to talk about establishing

305
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,360
zero trust we have to look at it through

306
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,680
a tiered approach first off you want to

307
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:42,399
confirm all your user identities

308
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,279
you want to gain access visibility you

309
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,760
want to ensure

310
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,600
device security and then you want to

311
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,439
enforce contextual access policies you

312
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,839
know user device combinations

313
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,440
and then ultimately you want to talk

314
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,519
about you know securing all

315
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,640
access to your applications so for

316
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:58,320
example if you have an

317
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,240
if you're based in sydney and you have

318
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,160
an application that you are using for

319
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,360
doing your business that is web enabled

320
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,000
you don't want to have some random

321
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,880
canadian

322
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,240
and his cat uh connecting to your system

323
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,760
and uh

324
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,920
logging in and checking your email

325
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,519
simply because he found a password

326
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:16,160
thank you penelope yes who knows needs

327
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:20,160
slides when you have a cat

328
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,000
oh dear you don't simply trust something

329
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,439
because it's inside your firewall

330
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,120
years ago i was working for an

331
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,839
organization where we had a penetration

332
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,519
test done

333
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,760
and when we were looking through the

334
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,680
results the cio looked at me and said

335
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,680
it's okay we have a firewall we trust

336
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:36,319
everybody on the inside

337
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,760
and in retrospect that was actually not

338
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,360
a good thing because we found that there

339
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,880
were at least two people on staff that

340
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,120
we should not have been trusting because

341
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,560
they were up to a nefarious end

342
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:46,320
these are the kind of things you want to

343
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,800
trust but verify you want to be able to

344
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,600
track

345
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,120
everything now we all like to be

346
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,680
environmentally friendly

347
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:57,440
but reusing passwords is not a good idea

348
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,920
so in previous organizations that i

349
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,600
worked at we did a lot of research into

350
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,880
compromised websites and the attackers

351
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,240
what they would like to do is they'd get

352
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,279
the usernames and passwords and then

353
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,279
replay them

354
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,360
against other sites trying to escalate

355
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,360
their privilege

356
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,480
so reusing passwords is absolutely not a

357
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,200
good idea

358
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,279
now rather than vilifying the users

359
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,440
which actually never works

360
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,640
it's quite counterproductive you want to

361
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,040
talk about

362
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,079
you know enabling them to do their job

363
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,160
better you want to talk about

364
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:28,560
democratizing security giving them

365
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,560
tools that are going to make it easier

366
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,518
for them to get their job done safely

367
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,640
and securely

368
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,839
you don't want to give them tools

369
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:39,279
written by engineers for engineers

370
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:41,360
now for example in monty python

371
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:42,880
movies you had you know good king arthur

372
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,000
coming up to the castle wall and trying

373
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,000
to gain access

374
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
and think about it like this if you say

375
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,320
oh yes my password is x

376
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,440
and they would say no go away or i taunt

377
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,920
you again

378
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,920
this really is the way it should be from

379
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,839
a multi-factor authentication approach

380
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,680
just because you have found the key

381
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,040
under the mat in front of your house

382
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,959
doesn't mean that the person coming

383
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:05,199
through the front door is necessarily

384
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,199
you

385
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,560
so before i ever got into computer

386
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,480
security i actually was doing a degree

387
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,560
in archaeology of all things

388
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,839
long story for another time hopefully

389
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,638
one day i'll actually be

390
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:19,440
in person assert that would be kind of

391
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,959
lovely

392
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,360
but one of the stories that i learned

393
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:25,839
from my time at that point

394
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,839
um

395
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,680
one of my favorite thank you mandy one

396
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,200
of my uh

397
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,279
favorite things at that time was a

398
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,360
lesson about the sack of rome

399
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,720
so in 410ad and i do tell this

400
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,160
particular story a lot because i think

401
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,880
it's rather poignant

402
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,639
the visigoths attacked the city and they

403
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,639
surrounded it and they waited

404
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,639
until the romans ran out of food and

405
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,920
water eventually the romans couldn't

406
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,120
take it anymore and they just threw open

407
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,160
the gates and they

408
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:54,639
the city was sacked the attackers

409
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,959
used their own paradigm against them

410
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:59,839
they were able to leverage their

411
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,479
antiquated perimeter approach against

412
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,880
them

413
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,639
so the idea of we have a firewall we

414
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,320
have a castle wall we have a moat

415
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,639
is really a deprecated notion that it's

416
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,600
demonstrably so for almost 2000 years

417
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,680
now

418
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,040
somehow we missed that particular lesson

419
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,560
from history

420
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,920
but the real lesson there is that

421
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:21,359
castles simply don't scale

422
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:23,360
pardon me so here in canada we like to

423
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,959
go for hikes a lot because well we can't

424
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,639
actually go anywhere because we're all

425
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,719
locked down

426
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,880
but one of the jokes that we would

427
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,560
always say is if you went out for a hike

428
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,079
you always wanted to be a little bit

429
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,959
faster than a hiker behind

430
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:39,279
you just in case a bear came along but

431
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,719
nowadays from a computer security type

432
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,680
of approach we're looking at it there

433
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,560
are bears

434
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:46,239
everywhere there's enough to go around

435
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,800
so we have to be

436
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,920
more diligent about our security

437
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,160
approach

438
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,399
we don't want to be the flaming sort of

439
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,839
justice running around saying how do we

440
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:59,760
get to know

441
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,760
and yes blessed are the acl makers

442
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,880
the idea of the the original way that

443
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,240
people would look at infosec

444
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,160
professionals was you know they're

445
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,320
always trying to tell us no

446
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,240
when realistically that is a deprecated

447
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,000
notion that we as security practitioners

448
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,600
have gotten to the point where we are

449
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,079
there to enable the business

450
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,680
to do things in a safe and secure manner

451
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:22,560
we don't want to just you know

452
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,160
fill their usb ports with epoxy and

453
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,439
encase their computer and cement and

454
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,519
drop it in the lake

455
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,600
that is not going to serve anybody's

456
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:33,040
better interests now

457
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,279
basically we were you know the

458
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,399
department of no it was came from

459
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,839
a place of you know purpose we thought

460
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,680
we were doing the right thing

461
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,480
and as with everything over time it

462
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,239
evolves now data breaches are something

463
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,880
that is near and dear to my heart and

464
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,519
these are

465
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,639
kind of things that just keep on going

466
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:53,199
now aws

467
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:55,040
s3 buckets for those of you don't know

468
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,399
please look it up it's a data repository

469
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,199
you can spin up with a

470
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:59,519
web browser these are excellent tools

471
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,399
but

472
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,399
if you go to set one of these up it says

473
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,839
in big bold print it says do not make

474
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,880
this public unless you know what you're

475
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:10,000
doing

476
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:12,880
i'm paraphrasing of course but

477
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
if you do that then anybody can find

478
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,519
this there's all sorts of different

479
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,120
scanning tools that can actually look

480
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,279
for these particular tools

481
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,600
or particular repositories rather and

482
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:23,680
they can gain access to your data

483
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,040
and this is the kind of thing where the

484
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,079
people that are typically spinning up

485
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:29,120
these buckets are

486
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:32,160
not necessarily security practitioners

487
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,480
it's more of a case of they didn't know

488
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:36,880
what the potential damage could be it's

489
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:40,880
incumbent upon us to do a better job of

490
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:43,040
educating folks on a wider scale

491
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,880
because the perimeter that we think we

492
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,759
have is actually quite porous when we

493
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,560
talk about https traffic vpns rdp

494
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:52,000
dns email what have you all of these

495
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,880
things are traversing our

496
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,959
perimeters in the traditional sense i go

497
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:59,360
back very much to talk about what

498
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:01,518
my boss wendy nather said the perimeter

499
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,480
is anywhere an access decision is being

500
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,320
made

501
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,839
and this is very very important so much

502
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,199
so that i repeat it in this talk more

503
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,639
than once

504
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,959
because the new perimeter we're dealing

505
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,959
with remote employees we're dealing with

506
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,040
hybrid clouds cloud applications

507
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,719
personal devices mobile devices

508
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,959
vendors and contractors everybody

509
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:21,120
connecting into our network

510
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,719
now with the zero trust model we are

511
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,480
looking at it from the perspective of

512
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,839
dealing with the workplace the workforce

513
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,000
and the workload

514
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,959
or more succinctly trusted users trusted

515
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,320
devices and

516
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,800
every application within your

517
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:34,880
organization

518
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,040
so back in 2012 i started tracking

519
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:38,880
database breaches

520
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,240
as a hobby apparently i have strange

521
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,279
hobbies but this is one of the things i

522
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,680
was doing

523
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,360
and that particular summer which i

524
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,800
labeled the summer of breach for some

525
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,040
particular reason

526
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,959
the biggest data breach at that time was

527
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,240
and a half million records

528
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:57,040
that pales in comparison to what we see

529
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,040
in today

530
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,040
yes the uh the cat did over the

531
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,800
department of no and he's moved on to

532
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,799
the other part of the basement here

533
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,959
um and the problem is with these data

534
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,799
breaches is anybody can have them these

535
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,360
days it literally could happen to anyone

536
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,199
like this

537
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,879
uh particular frame grab that you'll see

538
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,880
when i distribute the slides

539
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,559
is i was uh working for a company where

540
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,439
one of our sites was compromised and

541
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,199
they were a crew called the rootbeer sec

542
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:23,439
put up a new page for us and we were

543
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,559
just so happy about that

544
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:28,000
but this was a problem because this was

545
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:29,039
a system that should have been taken

546
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,559
offline

547
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,919
we had spoken with the group that was

548
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,360
responsible for it and they said yes

549
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:36,960
we'll take it offline

550
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,639
and unfortunately that did not happen

551
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,880
and i don't blame them for that i blame

552
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,120
myself and my own team because we didn't

553
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,320
close that particular loop

554
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,639
it was all meant with the best

555
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,360
intentions but unfortunately the road to

556
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:51,039
hell is paved with that

557
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,559
now if we look on sites like information

558
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,440
as beautiful.net we see

559
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:57,200
that data breaches are nothing new they

560
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,520
have been going on for a long time if we

561
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,280
go back about four years we see

562
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,039
just a whole host of them and we're

563
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,120
looking at orders of magnitude of 80

564
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,320
million to 76 million 191 million

565
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,399
records

566
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,678
and then we flash forward to more

567
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,400
recently

568
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,240
the website informationbeautiful.net

569
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:17,440
which does data visualization

570
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,240
they couldn't finish vij yep

571
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,559
try that again they couldn't fit all of

572
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,640
the

573
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:25,440
information onto the web page anymore so

574
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:28,880
much so that they had to re-jig

575
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:29,200
things they had to re-uh re-envision how

576
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,600
the

577
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,400
data was going to be presented this is a

578
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,000
real problem

579
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,679
so this led me to start wondering what

580
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,240
kind of ports are open

581
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:42,080
in australia as an example so as of

582
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,640
yesterday we were looking at

583
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,678
just about 6.3 million ports that were

584
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,520
open

585
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,960
that in of itself is not a big deal you

586
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,879
need them open order to get business

587
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,679
done but you can be sure that a subset

588
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,640
of them

589
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:56,400
will have security issues now as i

590
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,160
scroll through them

591
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,080
i found that there was 58 systems that

592
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,960
were online that were susceptible to

593
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:03,760
eternal blue

594
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,840
for compromise there was just under 3

595
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,840
000 systems that were still vulnerable

596
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,159
to heartbleed and that's been what five

597
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,600
plus years now

598
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:15,200
and there was also uh 1294 systems that

599
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,799
were vulnerable to the blue keep

600
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,120
vulnerability

601
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,280
so what does all that mean it means we

602
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:24,959
have to constantly be iterating through

603
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:26,879
and looking at the systems that we have

604
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,960
towards the facing towards the internet

605
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,240
sorry it's late here and i'm tripping on

606
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,080
my tongue

607
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,360
we want to go through and look at a

608
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,000
trusted access security

609
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,879
value proposition and how xero trust is

610
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,840
going to help

611
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,160
we want to make sure that we're

612
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,720
devaluing stolen credentials we want to

613
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,480
remove

614
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,559
low hanging fruit like easily patched

615
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,919
systems and when i say easily patched i

616
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,520
mean something that should have been

617
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,880
patched a while ago there's no such

618
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,360
thing as just patch it

619
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,799
it's never ever that simple regression

620
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,439
testing and all the rest of those fun

621
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,080
things

622
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,559
that people on the social media tend to

623
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,000
think oh

624
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,080
just magically patch it and it all goes

625
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,600
away it's never that easy

626
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,678
but you want to be able to complement

627
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,000
complement complicate lateral movement

628
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,080
through

629
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,679
an organization because you don't want

630
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:12,240
to make the attacker's job

631
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:13,840
easier now back in 2003 2004 time frame

632
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,280
one of the conversations i was having in

633
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,879
the place that i was working at that

634
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,799
time was talking about how we can make

635
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,480
all laptops desktops and systems as

636
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:23,039
bastion hosts

637
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:25,440
i did not realize at that time that i

638
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:27,679
was talking about a zero trust type of

639
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,679
perspective

640
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,760
and this was very interesting in of

641
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,600
itself because

642
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,960
i actually survived that meeting just

643
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,080
barely because the

644
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,919
system admins that would have been

645
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,799
responsible for patching and maintaining

646
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,960
all those systems

647
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,200
damn near ran me out of the room and

648
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,000
thankfully i escaped they're

649
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,360
quite unscathed but here we are in you

650
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,919
know 2020 as

651
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,879
insane as this year has been but zero

652
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,400
trust is a real viable option

653
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,320
now when we're talking about patching

654
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,159
systems in order to get our business

655
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,039
done or setting them up

656
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,640
we move from the dmz to the soft chewy

657
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,320
center in an organization

658
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,840
and what i mean by that is i've been in

659
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,399
several organizations over the years

660
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,959
where

661
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,640
all the effort would be put into

662
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,919
patching and hardening the systems that

663
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,240
were internet facing

664
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:15,120
but the back end systems typically would

665
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:17,280
not be

666
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,520
receiving the same amount of care and

667
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,840
feeding which had always struck me as

668
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,120
odd in one particular case i found

669
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,320
systems that were in

670
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:29,840
a dmz that were

671
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:32,320
i kid you not had full installs of the

672
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:34,320
microsoft office suite and i asked why

673
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,200
are these systems running a microsoft

674
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,480
office suite

675
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,240
and they said oh we had the license for

676
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,080
it so we thought we put it on there and

677
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,799
says you just managed to expand your

678
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,520
attack

679
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,879
your attack profile there we want to

680
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,360
make sure that we're having a sensible

681
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,440
discussion

682
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,280
on how to patch these systems just

683
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,520
because they're on the internal network

684
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:54,639
doesn't mean they're not susceptible to

685
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,320
issues when we're talking about zero

686
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,520
trust we're talking about

687
00:21:56,320 --> 00:22:00,799
you know things like multi-factor

688
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:03,840
authentication network zone segmentation

689
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:06,960
asset inventories for users and devices

690
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,959
and every time we do something in a zero

691
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,760
trust framework we want to make sure we

692
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,559
are going through

693
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,400
as a game of increments never try to

694
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,918
boil the ocean and do everything at once

695
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,640
because azir

696
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,400
is literally going to take you years you

697
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,760
would absolutely be a hero if you could

698
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,080
pull it off in a year but

699
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,520
let's be realistic about this we still

700
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,000
have to be able to do business and keep

701
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,120
the lights

702
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,039
on so if you're going to look at

703
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:36,080
heading towards dealing with a um

704
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:36,080
zero trust approach

705
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:43,760
parties as they um

706
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,760
sorry i'm going to look at this

707
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,480
yes olivier oliver um

708
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,000
i apologize if i misspelled your name or

709
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,000
mispronounced your name uh

710
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,440
internal threats are absolutely key but

711
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,159
you want to determine your priorities

712
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,559
within your organizations to make sure

713
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:00,320
that you are approaching this in a way

714
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:02,879
that makes sense for your business

715
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,720
easy way to do it to get started is

716
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,240
obviating the use for static passwords

717
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,760
alone you want to look at

718
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,520
rolling out multi-factor authentication

719
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,120
is one particular example

720
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,960
because this will reduce the risk in

721
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,360
your organization

722
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,880
because if your systems are attacked and

723
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,918
compromised

724
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,120
how do you know that the system

725
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,679
the accounts that are being used to

726
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:25,360
access your networks are actually in

727
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,159
fact the ones that are supposed to be

728
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,000
there

729
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,080
now by all accounts when you read about

730
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
data breaches in various reports

731
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,918
there's usually a mean time of about 200

732
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,600
days before an organization realizes

733
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:37,280
it's been breached

734
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,280
think of the amount of damage an

735
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,320
attacker could do with a legitimate set

736
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,600
of credentials

737
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,799
in that space of time let alone in a day

738
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,480
these are the kind of things we want to

739
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:48,000
make sure that we're taking that off the

740
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,799
table and making it harder for the

741
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,840
attackers

742
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,840
to do their job

743
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,039
now we want to look at security best

744
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,879
practices and

745
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,400
i always have a tongue-in-cheek when i

746
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,440
hear that term because who's actually

747
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,200
practicing but

748
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,360
realistically you want to be verifying

749
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,200
your users verifying your devices

750
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,039
and protecting every application that

751
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,000
you need in order to get business done

752
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,000
in your organization

753
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,760
you want to also look at devices with

754
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,440
poor security hygiene

755
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,039
you want to be able to say that when a

756
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,440
device is connecting to your network

757
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,240
either by vpn or through a network

758
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,000
gateway

759
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,520
that you are checking them to make sure

760
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,440
that they are patched to current or n

761
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,960
minus one or whatever your risk appetite

762
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,799
is in your organization

763
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,000
before they can attach the cloud

764
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:33,760
applications that you need

765
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,360
or the on-premise applications you need

766
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:37,279
in order to get business done

767
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,320
you don't want to be introducing any

768
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:42,080
extra problems into the organization

769
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,439
now with zero trust access you can look

770
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,520
at it for example as

771
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,720
the user makes a request to access an

772
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,320
application

773
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,919
first you have to check using

774
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,439
multi-factor authentication to ensure

775
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,320
that yes they are the person that they

776
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,159
say they are

777
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:55,840
you want to evaluate the trustworthiness

778
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,880
of the user device and its security

779
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,480
posture

780
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,080
then you want to enforce the policies

781
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,200
that pertain to that user device

782
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,039
combination

783
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,799
and enable a secure connection at that

784
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:06,240
point to the application

785
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:10,000
you just want to make sure that you're

786
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,000
reducing the risk to your organization

787
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,720
so when you're looking at doing zero

788
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,520
trust you want to look at it from a

789
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,840
perspective of

790
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,600
how can i get started where where can i

791
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,199
go you want to have a shopping list

792
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,879
you want to have an asset inventory you

793
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,159
want to look at user management

794
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,520
you want to make sure you have device

795
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,400
management through uniform security

796
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,039
policies

797
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,720
defined repeatable processes are a big

798
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:30,400
win internally to your organization

799
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,159
because you can do this yourself

800
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,760
you don't need a vendor to do this part

801
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,640
for you this is something that'll help

802
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,240
reduce

803
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,760
rates of incidents within your own

804
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,279
organization

805
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,440
and then when you're collecting all the

806
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:43,279
data from your xero trust your logging

807
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,440
all the rest of it you can look for user

808
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:47,279
and entity behavior analytics

809
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,799
and then one of the key ones is network

810
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,080
zone segmentation

811
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,559
now this is something that should have

812
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,439
been done for the last 30 odd years

813
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:58,080
but let's be honest not everybody does a

814
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:59,440
really good job of this

815
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,799
now when i went through and looked at

816
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,559
all those ports earlier that i was

817
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,879
talking about the 6.3 million ports that

818
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,600
are

819
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,279
listening in australia alone i found

820
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,158
that there was a subset of them

821
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,600
running ssh that i just randomly picked

822
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,480
a few of them and i found one in

823
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,639
particular

824
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,400
had one two three four about 10

825
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,760
different severe vulnerabilities that

826
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,600
were affecting it

827
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,200
now think of that if that was in an

828
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:23,439
enterprise

829
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,400
that could potentially lead to very

830
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,559
serious issues

831
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:28,240
on down the road so you want to make

832
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,760
sure that you are not making it easier

833
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,159
for the attacker by patching the current

834
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,679
or n

835
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,240
minus one and you want to make sure that

836
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:36,480
you are encrypting all the traffic

837
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,440
you want to encrypt data at rest data in

838
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,080
flight

839
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,600
and we have to look at doing things in a

840
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:43,678
better fashion

841
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,320
what's a better way forward how about

842
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:49,279
using an open standard like webauthn

843
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,039
if you haven't read this one w3c has put

844
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,240
out a open standard it was ratified

845
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:55,039
about a year ago

846
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:55,919
and this is a way to move even further

847
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,520
down the line

848
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,039
away from static passwords to a

849
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,960
passwordless future

850
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,879
and this is something that is viable

851
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,360
today where you are able to log into

852
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,200
your

853
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,879
smartphone use the local device

854
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,960
authentication then he completes

855
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,640
your connection to whatever website you

856
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,320
are trying to protect

857
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,400
if you do nothing else today other than

858
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,480
check out duo.com at cisco.com

859
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,799
um make sure that you look up web

860
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:20,000
authent it is an open standard it is not

861
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:23,840
a vendory thing

862
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,120
at all so as i only have a few minutes

863
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,399
left i'm going to take a time take a

864
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,080
moment here to

865
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:30,158
go back and sum up what we're talking

866
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,918
about here when you're looking at doing

867
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,600
zero trust it's about reducing

868
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:35,520
risk in your organization and

869
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,639
fundamentally reducing the costs in your

870
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,240
organization

871
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,159
you want to assume that your network is

872
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:41,840
hostile at all times but you want to

873
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,000
establish a trust engine

874
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,279
you want to reduce the threat surface

875
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,200
and continually

876
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:49,760
validate the authorization you want to

877
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,200
keep it as simple as possible

878
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,320
now i gave you a shopping list earlier

879
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,600
and i'm going to go back over real

880
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,840
quickly here you want to build your

881
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,719
asset inventory of both users and

882
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,480
devices

883
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,720
you want to get a solid hold on user

884
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:03,039
management you don't want to have

885
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,000
a user account in your organization that

886
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:06,399
has been

887
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,919
active for 10 years but that person has

888
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,559
not been part of your company for 10

889
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,679
years

890
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,678
these are the kind of things that

891
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,360
unfortunately happen far too often you

892
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:14,720
want to be able to know what is on your

893
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:17,120
network

894
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,080
to find repeatable processes are a very

895
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,279
very good thing

896
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:23,199
for any organization to help reduce risk

897
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,720
fundamentally and reduce the rates of

898
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,240
incidence

899
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,240
you want to look at user and entity

900
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,399
behavior analytics from the

901
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,240
data that you're collecting and please

902
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:34,559
please please network zone segmentation

903
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,720
is a key thing you want to be able to

904
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:38,158
secure the workplace the workload and

905
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,399
the workforce

906
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:42,240
xero trust is an easy way to get you

907
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:45,360
started for your superhero

908
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:46,640
role you want a reduction in risk a

909
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,559
reduction in costs

910
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:50,399
and an improvement of sleep

911
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,600
fundamentally what's not to love at that

912
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:54,158
point

913
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,760
so as odd as it has to do give a talk

914
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:57,679
without slides and it's not the first

915
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,120
time i've had to do this in my career

916
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,039
