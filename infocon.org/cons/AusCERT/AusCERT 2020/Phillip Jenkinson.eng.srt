37
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,680
um okay so i was asked to speak on

38
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,720
on this subject this subject is very

39
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,759
dear to

40
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:35,360
my heart um um

41
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,200
i'll just give you an understanding of

42
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,840
where this where this drive comes from

43
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,600
because it is

44
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,960
it is a little bit unusual for a

45
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,280
non-indigenous man

46
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,479
to be as passionate about this as i am

47
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,759
um

48
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,600
about two years ago my dad um

49
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,200
passed away he was married to my mum for

50
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,479
56 years

51
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,799
um he he he um

52
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,320
produced three beautiful boys and we all

53
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,640
stayed out of jail so i think he's

54
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,240
done a very good job there um but for

55
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,240
all the wonderful things that he

56
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,478
he was he was also a smoker um and so

57
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,280
it came to no surprise that uh dad

58
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,680
passed away from

59
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,520
stage four lung cancer uh about two

60
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,200
years ago and one of the things that dad

61
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:18,640
drove home to the three boys

62
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,079
um was this concept of legacy sun

63
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,679
leave the world in a better place than

64
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,400
when you found it and

65
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,000
and um you know i was really passionate

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,000
about it security i've been involved in

67
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,239
the industry for 10 years

68
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,680
uh and and like you know an event where

69
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,360
something is cataclysmic as a parent

70
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,040
passing away it really

71
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,120
caused me to stop and just have a little

72
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,040
bit of a 70 check and introspection what

73
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,160
i was doing in the industry and why

74
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,920
you know a way i could be responsible of

75
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,400
creating a positive legacy

76
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,920
and i started on this journey of um it

77
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,160
was just before the world cup

78
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,238
and we started on the journey of of

79
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:55,440
being able to rattle off with

80
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,760
relative uninterruption um notable

81
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,280
first nations sporting stars right and

82
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,120
it was it was across the it was across

83
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,440
the board it wasn't just rugby union

84
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,280
it's kirby beale uh it was it was rugby

85
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,000
league it was afl was tennis and it was

86
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,319
you know you start

87
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,400
looking into it there's horse racing and

88
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,000
there's darts champions

89
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,680
then i started to extrapolate that out

90
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,920
and looked at music and

91
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,440
activism and politics and education and

92
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,518
war

93
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,800
and i could find instances of really

94
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,959
really cool

95
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,720
first nations not just at a at a

96
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,680
representation but at the international

97
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,200
standard

98
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,799
and then i came to look at my own

99
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,359
industry

100
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,400
um and i was really ashamed to say that

101
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,680
after 10 years

102
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,519
of working in in it security i'm both

103
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,080
from a vendor and a reseller

104
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,599
and having touched some fairly large

105
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,440
accounts in federal and state government

106
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,280
that i couldn't name

107
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,519
an indigenous pentester or first nation

108
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,920
stock manager uh laurie i know you're on

109
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,799
the

110
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,200
uh on the call i hope what i tell you

111
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,159
you can

112
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,280
identify with i couldn't name until uh

113
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,560
finding laurie

114
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,319
an indigenous seeso um let alone a cio

115
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,080
and i thought that

116
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,518
thankfully my ignorance was being lifted

117
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,879
and now i can

118
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,879
name um and identify men and women

119
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,720
who identify as being first nations in

120
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,120
us in our sector i just think there

121
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:17,199
needs to be more of them i think that

122
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:20,079
our society and our our industry

123
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,840
needs to work harder at producing these

124
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,520
role models so with that as a as a

125
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,000
backdrop of to why i'm talking about

126
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,000
what i'm

127
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,160
talking about then i'll uh i'll crack on

128
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,520
so in keeping with the theme

129
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,360
uh kryptonite for me is is barriers to

130
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:34,639
indigenous inclusion diversity and i.t

131
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,000
security

132
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,919
i'm going to keep it short and sharp and

133
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,320
punchy i'm going to i'm going to limit

134
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,320
it to

135
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,840
to nine slides so rather than listen to

136
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,880
gender and just read off my powerpoints

137
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,560
there's going to be lots of

138
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,639
lots of talking i'm going to try and

139
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,840
keep my eye on the on the chat screen so

140
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,880
if there is a question

141
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,198
please um type it in or if you allow me

142
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
to

143
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,400
to rattle through this i'll answer all

144
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,199
the questions uh

145
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,960
at the end of the um at the end of the

146
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,199
presentation so

147
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,638
what does one ask you you men and women

148
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,160
on the on the call

149
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,160
like do you guys think that we have a

150
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,520
problem i mean i certainly do but but

151
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,960
i've done a bit of research on this i

152
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,560
certainly don't have all the answers but

153
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,280
i've got some answers and i wanted to

154
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,639
ask you

155
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,719
um if we had a problem and a way that

156
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,320
i've articulated this in the past is

157
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,680
just to ask yourself this question

158
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,360
right and i'll get you to do it

159
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,960
virtually but

160
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,479
could you just stop for a moment and

161
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,479
think of an indigenous

162
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,000
all right that you can name and picture

163
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,679
the face

164
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,880
and for those of you who can't think of

165
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,479
an indigenous sports style i'll just

166
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:37,919
throw a name out there ash barney

167
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,599
or or anthony mundine or jonathan

168
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,000
thurston okay so now we've got

169
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,600
that picture of that that smiling face

170
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,039
in our brain

171
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,000
so i'm going to virtually ask you to put

172
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,520
both hands in the air and say right

173
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,120
now keep your hands in the air if you

174
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,080
can think of an indigenous man or woman

175
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,560
who you've worked with

176
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,960
in it who identifies as being first

177
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,960
nations

178
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,400
and i'd ask you everyone on the court to

179
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,039
ask themselves the same question

180
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,318
except now if we can think of it being

181
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,639
the dart

182
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,840
during being the bullseye ask yourself

183
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,400
this how many

184
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,000
um men and women have you bumped into in

185
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,400
your career or even in the last 12

186
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,479
months

187
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,239
that have identified as being first

188
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,758
nations in it security

189
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,680
and and i think and i'm happy to be

190
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,800
challenged on this but i think that the

191
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,520
answers will be

192
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,280
will be in single digits if not zero and

193
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,680
and so i think that there is a problem

194
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,359
um so yeah we've got a problem and the

195
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,280
problem comes from

196
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,479
um what we've just played out there

197
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,719
stereotypes right

198
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,599
pigeonholing first nations men and women

199
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,720
into sport is a very very dangerous

200
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,400
uh pigeonhole and and it starts to

201
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:48,479
um it starts to put these

202
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,159
beautifully talented and creative human

203
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,919
beings into little

204
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,840
pigeon holes of what they can and can't

205
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,280
do to be successful and sports certainly

206
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,840
is is one of those ones

207
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,359
um and it's a it's a problem that the us

208
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,080
is experiencing

209
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,680
um over there as well it's and it's

210
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,880
something that we need to be conscious

211
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,840
and cognizant of addressing

212
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,440
here in australia um workplace culture

213
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,880
lack of role models supply diversity

214
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,000
i'll pull these apart in a moment

215
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,039
financial constraints

216
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,160
educational gaps reliable access to

217
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:18,880
technology um

218
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,160
ignorance um supply chain diversity or

219
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,680
sorry supply chain

220
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,919
consolidation and fear we've touched on

221
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,039
um stereotypes workplace culture is a

222
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:29,280
big one and

223
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,199
reconciliation action plans which i'll

224
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,318
which i'll extrapolate on a little bit

225
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,800
of this call

226
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,720
um it is definitely a barrier to

227
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,240
inclusion um

228
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:43,599
uh certainly there are some some

229
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:47,280
um sectors in

230
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,878
in the workplace or awesome um

231
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,479
some categories in the workplace where

232
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,199
first nations men and women feel more

233
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,878
welcome

234
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:57,440
than than than others and

235
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,280
by by consulting with traditional owners

236
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,120
uh nukemberland

237
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,479
and jager and tourable where where i

238
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,400
live um

239
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,719
we can identify that some of those were

240
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,919
those were places of the traditional

241
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,560
um what would be referred to as as uh

242
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,758
traditional

243
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:17,039
uh indigenous occupations things like

244
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:20,319
um arts arts and uh uh tourism

245
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,080
and hospitality and um you know cultural

246
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,080
events and indeed sports so

247
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,159
we have to really work hard around the

248
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,159
culture that we're exuding to

249
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,560
potential employees a lack of role

250
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,000
models um so we're bouncing around town

251
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:35,760
saying that we want to create the first

252
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,519
jt invited um i bumped into a wonderful

253
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,039
young lady in procurement recently and

254
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,120
she asked him why i was so

255
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,319
focused on creating the first justin

256
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,200
timberlake of

257
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,720
of it and i said no no the wrong way it

258
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:49,360
was the wrong jt

259
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,040
um the reason why we wanted to pick that

260
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,640
man out in particular was that there is

261
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,240
a guy that represents everything that's

262
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,240
wholesome good about sport

263
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:01,360
culture um mob um business philanthropy

264
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,200
um looking after his children looking

265
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,880
after his family clean living

266
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,399
choices all of these things that

267
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:09,680
personified in this

268
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,959
pinup boy uh for aspiring indigenous

269
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:12,880
sports stars who do you want to be like

270
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:14,640
when you grow up i want to be like jt

271
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,480
i want to be like mark ella i want to be

272
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,640
like seventh

273
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:20,160
and i think that um with the exception

274
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,279
of a couple of people on this call

275
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,000
specifically here

276
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,360
um that there is a distinct lack of role

277
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,519
models at that at that

278
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,959
uh cso level um supply diversity which

279
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,399
is really important because

280
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,399
um if if we if we if we

281
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,839
if we don't diversify our supply chain

282
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,680
then it's sort of like the meaningful

283
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:42,000
question how how can we how can we

284
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,040
encourage to perceive just being an

285
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,720
inclusive sector

286
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:50,319
when our supply chain is literally um

287
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,320
you know either either all white or uh

288
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,160
there are no women known business or

289
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,600
there's no veterans business i'm a

290
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,560
veteran myself

291
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,240
uh perhaps there's no uh australian

292
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,839
disability enterprise businesses

293
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,839
on in your supply chain so it's not just

294
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,200
about indigenous but for the purpose of

295
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,040
today's conversation

296
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,320
it certainly will be uh financial

297
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,319
constraints is something that i'm very

298
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,040
passionate about um

299
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:15,120
we understand that that what makes a

300
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,480
candidate also what can make a candidate

301
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,800
particularly attractive

302
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,800
for employment in in a sock team are

303
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,359
these international certifications

304
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,519
uh i can assure you after paying for a

305
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,399
number of them they are not cheap

306
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,040
and i put it to you guys that um that a

307
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:31,120
sans

308
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,880
incident response handling course which

309
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,560
would make

310
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,079
any graduate but if we're just going to

311
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,160
focus on indigenous graduates an

312
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,399
indigenous graduate from university

313
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,199
who then has a sans incident response

314
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:43,360
handling course

315
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,880
under her wing would make her more

316
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:47,519
attractive for employment

317
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,160
so there is a financial constraint that

318
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,839
that

319
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,839
i think our industry plays a lot of

320
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,440
importance on those c acronyms and

321
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,760
anything from osaka and anything from

322
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,240
sans uh educational gaps so

323
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:59,600
the two are linked there between the

324
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,839
industry

325
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,600
and the certifications and what we're

326
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,120
asking of our graduates when they come

327
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,680
through uni or through tables from high

328
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,760
school

329
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,519
we're asking them to to know more to be

330
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,360
more certified

331
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:16,480
access to technology so certainly

332
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,160
out west you know

333
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,640
in remote regional communities across

334
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:23,839
australia um there is a there is a

335
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,839
barrier to to to this idea about

336
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,120
regular uninterrupted internet now i

337
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,120
certainly can't

338
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,320
i can't provide a solution for that in

339
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,519
fact the three things that i wanted to

340
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,800
speak about today

341
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:36,160
um were financial constraints

342
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,000
educational constraints

343
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,279
and social constraints a little bit of

344
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,720
ignorance there around

345
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:45,920
um you know what

346
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,360
i think people in general um uh can do

347
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:51,439
and um supply chain consolidation and

348
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,639
and this is working very closely with

349
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,639
chief procurement officers and

350
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:56,320
understanding that what these men and

351
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,160
women are taught at university

352
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,680
um and what we are proposing around

353
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,120
supply chain diversity

354
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,519
it's almost um it's sort of like a a

355
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,279
flip of the coin where we where we would

356
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,440
traditionally think that supply chain

357
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:11,360
consolidation is all about cost savings

358
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,560
reducing risk

359
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,600
and providing benefits to the

360
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:19,199
organization counter that with

361
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:21,600
supplier diversity which is also about

362
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,720
being a more corporately responsible

363
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,079
citizen

364
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:27,279
being more representative of the

365
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,279
community in which we operate

366
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,120
that we support and and the final one

367
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,000
for me is fear

368
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,560
and um this is my opinion and i'm happy

369
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,680
to

370
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,160
be challenged on it uh in a nice way um

371
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,959
please don't believe that sometimes i

372
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,000
think

373
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,359
having done this for a little while um

374
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
sometimes i think that there is a

375
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,360
general fear in the community and in

376
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,480
corporate and

377
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:54,240
um private sector the fear of saying the

378
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,200
wrong thing

379
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,079
paralyzes people to say nothing at all

380
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,560
or or the fear of doing the wrong thing

381
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,479
and being reprimanded paralyzes people

382
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,319
from doing anything at all

383
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:11,600
and i think that that paralysis

384
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:14,639
is almost as as bad as

385
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:16,320
as the you know

386
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,560
what was going to be said and the way it

387
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:19,920
was described to me was that

388
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,719
if something you said or something is

389
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:25,839
done and it's coming from um

390
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:30,000
sort of a a point of of uneducation

391
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:32,720
or or benevolent ignorance

392
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,839
um it's not as bad as just sort of

393
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,120
sticking your head in the sand and

394
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,440
pretending that we don't have a problem

395
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,440
and

396
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,720
and there's a fear of putting your hand

397
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,240
up to say listen

398
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,920
boss i don't agree with that can we do

399
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,399
something different um that's that's

400
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:46,959
what i mean about fear

401
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,480
so is it a i mean is it really a problem

402
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:51,839
in australia in you know

403
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,959
itc security in 2020 and we just

404
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,519
bring you back to that original

405
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:58,319
statement um that i have done before

406
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,320
both here in queensland and and down in

407
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,720
melbourne in large audiences where we

408
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:03,519
where we we just play that um little

409
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,839
game about

410
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,000
you know identifying men and women who

411
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:09,120
we've worked with so yeah i i think it's

412
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:13,920
uh it absolutely is

413
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:18,399
um and there are two main reasons um

414
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,399
it's social and economic so

415
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,880
the advantages of of what we're talking

416
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,399
about are not

417
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:26,560
just the warm fuzzy feelings that we get

418
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:30,079
from from doing something that is fair

419
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:32,880
you know just and and morally correct um

420
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:34,560
ask any of the the ceos of an asx listed

421
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,320
organization and they'll be proudly

422
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,920
beating beating chests and saying yeah

423
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,040
they're we're all about creating

424
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:42,479
diverse organizations um you know

425
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,079
they might point to their inclusion

426
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,800
policy or the diverse people in their

427
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,760
workplace

428
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,040
support of local communities um you know

429
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,600
indeed three out of the

430
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,800
fortune 500 companies now employ a chief

431
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:55,279
diversity officer

432
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:57,680
um but there remains a critical area

433
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:01,279
that every organization needs to focus

434
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,800
on and and it's their supply chain

435
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,560
um over the last few years supply

436
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,439
diversity has gained a significant

437
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,439
amount of traction

438
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,639
um to become one of the the largest

439
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,560
trends in

440
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,839
enterprise uh procurement and this is

441
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:12,800
reflected in some of the stuff that

442
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,720
we're seeing

443
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,319
um having worked closely with supply

444
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,560
nation and reconciliation

445
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,600
uh action plans australia and i'll talk

446
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,638
about that in a moment

447
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,839
so organizations like um and it's not

448
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:24,720
exhausted by any stretch of the

449
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,160
imagination

450
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,839
there are thousands of organizations

451
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,639
that do this but you know

452
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,959
the big four banks um rio dhp flight

453
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,959
center

454
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:36,160
uh bank of queensland you know some of

455
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:37,680
the vendors who are

456
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,040
sharing this call with us now are

457
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,680
looking at all this but they've made

458
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:45,680
massive investments in supply diversity

459
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:46,719
um because i think today's organizations

460
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,279
need to think a little bit

461
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:50,639
differently about their supply chain um

462
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,320
procurement corporate social

463
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:55,120
responsibility programs and how the

464
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:57,920
three uh intricately you know what in

465
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,480
interwoven apologies i i believe that

466
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,000
those

467
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,920
who do this and and pay attention to csr

468
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
programs will have an opportunity to

469
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,040
change the world in ways that

470
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,199
you know our predecessors um could

471
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,959
could couldn't have never imagined uh

472
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,079
and and i also believe that those that

473
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,079
don't change

474
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,638
um will be left behind excuse me just

475
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:22,079
while i blow my nose

476
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:24,800
uh i don't have covert

477
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:26,239
simply understood supply diversity is

478
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,599
about your supply chain the supplies

479
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,240
that constitute this chain and

480
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,680
in in to achieve supply diversity

481
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,440
organizations must be

482
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,279
accepting and open to changing their

483
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,959
supply chain to make it more inclusive

484
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,399
and an inclusive supply chain just

485
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,119
doesn't start and stop with

486
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,639
indigenous business um we would be

487
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,600
talking about certainly indigenous owned

488
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,120
businesses

489
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:47,680
we'd also be talking about women to own

490
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,680
businesses veteran-owned businesses

491
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,719
australian disability enterprise owned

492
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,680
businesses and indeed

493
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,000
social enterprises um and why is it

494
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:58,079
important that we focus on these guys

495
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,839
well i think it's quite simple these

496
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,560
businesses are typically disadvantaged

497
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,560
for being different

498
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,799
um they

499
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,559
can be discriminated against because of

500
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,240
their differences

501
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,760
but by supporting these organizations

502
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,919
there's a valuable opportunity to

503
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,280
promote growth of local communities to

504
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,839
strengthen the economy

505
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,359
and to provide more opportunities for

506
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:22,480
individuals and businesses

507
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:24,479
and indeed the nation to grow and and

508
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,679
prosper

509
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,679
um so so there

510
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:31,280
that's that's what's at risk if we do

511
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:32,080
nothing and i think that if we do

512
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,520
something there

513
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,520
the advantages are pretty

514
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:40,080
uh pretty compelling so a lot of people

515
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,639
sit back and

516
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,120
and uh and wait for the government to do

517
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,240
something

518
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:47,360
it's um but after have working very

519
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,160
closely with the government

520
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,080
when we kicked this um this business off

521
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:56,960
uh we flew down and spoke to

522
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,960
some ministers and the um

523
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,840
refreshingly the the uniform feedback to

524
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,440
to us

525
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,280
when we flew down as a consortium to

526
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,360
talk about indigenous business was

527
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,039
the government's role was to be a better

528
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,360
customer and indeed there was a quote

529
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,840
there

530
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:13,678
from the then cyber minister um if we

531
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,159
want to transform the entrepreneurial

532
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,760
digital

533
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,520
government sector in australia the most

534
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,960
important thing we can do is to be a

535
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,760
better customer

536
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,600
um you know i believe that the

537
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,520
government's role is to embrace the

538
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,639
federally mandated procurement policies

539
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,400
and to enforce at a state level those

540
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,640
state-based procurement objectives and

541
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,600
then for individuals within those

542
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,360
state-based

543
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,840
organizations and federally based

544
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,520
organizations their role is to enlighten

545
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,639
themselves and to be accountable and if

546
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,480
no one else is looking just be

547
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:46,240
accountable to yourself

548
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:50,480
this is the right thing to do on on on

549
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,760
on so many levels um

550
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,440
it's not just enterprises that are

551
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,960
putting the spotlight on supply

552
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:58,640
diversity the commonwealth government

553
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,480
has made massive leaps of supply chain

554
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,559
diversity through the ipp through the

555
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,480
indigenous procurement policy

556
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:09,039
um the government is set to

557
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,799
to sorry has set its sights to achieve

558
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,919
three percent of every government goods

559
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:14,320
and services

560
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,320
uh to be consumed through an indigenous

561
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,159
business by 2020

562
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,039
and to ensure that there is a tangible

563
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,559
change to

564
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,480
to supply diversity from a government

565
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,160
perspective those targets are

566
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,720
enforceable

567
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,880
the ipp sets out to create opportunities

568
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,840
for it for indigenous businesses to grow

569
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,840
to drive demand for goods and services

570
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,918
provided by indigenous businesses

571
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:40,720
to boost employment to stimulate new

572
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:42,559
investment into indigenous businesses

573
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,080
and then there are the the sometimes the

574
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,000
things that we don't think about as a

575
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,678
sector and there are things like

576
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,280
creating intergenerational wealth so

577
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:50,080
wealth that's handed down through the

578
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:52,559
generations

579
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,320
uh opportunity employment pathways for

580
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,678
kids to follow as they leave uni and

581
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,678
they're looking around

582
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,679
to potential career opportunities and

583
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:04,158
starting to look at it security as a

584
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,360
viable career pathway

585
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,919
um and and and and i think that there is

586
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,840
a

587
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,520
you know a great responsibility that the

588
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,199
government has and i also think that by

589
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,960
leading by example

590
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,640
um it's showing that indigenous

591
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,000
adversary is showing that by including

592
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,840
indigenous businesses

593
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,280
uh in your supply chain can bring around

594
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,320
so many benefits

595
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:25,678
um the ipp not only demonstrates right

596
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,600
purchasing behaviors

597
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,799
from organizations that have a

598
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,199
significant amount

599
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,000
of money to push down through the supply

600
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,600
chain

601
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,120
but it also sends a very powerful

602
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,520
message to corporate australia

603
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,600
um and and i believe that that message

604
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,120
is that if all businesses get behind

605
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,760
the australian government's grow our

606
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,879
goal then the markets will grow

607
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:50,240
economy will thrive um and

608
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:51,440
and we will start to see um

609
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,559
and it certainly won't happen overnight

610
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,840
and i'm not proposing that there's going

611
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,639
to be a tsunami but there will be a

612
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,000
trickle

613
00:20:54,640 --> 00:21:01,039
uh which will grow into a flood of

614
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,039
capable indigenous men and women um

615
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,799
that will that will provide those role

616
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:08,080
models for for other

617
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:09,679
for other kids to follow um

618
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,280
interestingly enough the difference

619
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,400
between the two slides between

620
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,600
private and uh public uh there's not a

621
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,880
great deal of difference and i think the

622
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,760
private sector needs to be a better

623
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,679
customer

624
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,760
uh i think the private sector needs to

625
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:23,600
embrace reconciliation action plans not

626
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,520
just as a tick box

627
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,719
so not just saying i've got a plan but

628
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,799
what is the

629
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,880
what am i going to do with that plan how

630
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:33,200
am i going to use reconciliation action

631
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,200
all those supporting frameworks that

632
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,440
reconciliation action plans provide

633
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,799
how am i going to use those for good um

634
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,240
how am i going to

635
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,480
enforce procurement objectives that

636
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,400
support social outcomes

637
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,919
and then from an individual level how

638
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,880
can i educate myself

639
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,640
as a private sector employee or someone

640
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:54,159
who buys or procures

641
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,760
uh itc security um goods and services

642
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,080
how can i educate myself and be

643
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,280
accountable to not only my business but

644
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,960
also my customers

645
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,559
and the community that my business

646
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,360
operates in um

647
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,480
our community is diverse our customers

648
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,520
are diverse

649
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,559
so let's make other parts of the

650
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,120
the corporate structure diverse um i

651
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:16,879
think that's

652
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:18,959
um that's that's that's really important

653
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,039
um i'm gonna steal a quote from the

654
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,360
chairperson supply nation

655
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,120
um supply nation by the way is a

656
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,320
not-for-profit organization

657
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,158
with the purpose of providing

658
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,039
opportunities for small

659
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,640
to medium enterprise indigenous owners

660
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,600
to enter into commercial relationships

661
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:36,960
with large corporate

662
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:38,799
government entities indigenous

663
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,360
businesses certified with supply nation

664
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,639
can

665
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,399
can get a lot of support from this

666
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,840
organization and as the chairperson of

667
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,919
supply nation

668
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,480
told a newspaper we educate procurement

669
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,320
officers to broaden their minds

670
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,400
now if they need high views workwear

671
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,320
security services or everyday purchases

672
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,400
like paper

673
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,000
we absolutely have a business an

674
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,720
indigenous owned business that we can

675
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,480
point you in the direction of

676
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,559
uh and that then opens up you know the

677
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,080
sort of the idea that indigenous

678
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,399
businesses are not

679
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:11,280
uh homogenous and they're not always

680
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,640
about culture

681
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,918
uh community or sport um

682
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,559
they're entrepreneurial they're

683
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,559
pioneering they're innovative they come

684
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,720
um they come with a different way of

685
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:25,039
looking at a problem

686
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,559
old problem new sense of bias so i think

687
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,440
this idea about

688
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:31,280
um you know and i and i keep laboring on

689
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,120
the point about supply diversity supply

690
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,320
diversity supply diversity

691
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,840
because whilst bathum solutions

692
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,120
represents queensland's

693
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:44,080
first and only uh supply nation

694
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:47,520
certified i.t security consultancy

695
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:50,320
there must be 50 or 60 non-indigenous

696
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,600
i.t security consultancies and so i'm

697
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:54,080
proposing that if the

698
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,039
if the sector in queensland can support

699
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,639
those 60

700
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,440
and one of ours then it it just goes to

701
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,640
show that

702
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,640
well there should be 10 of us there

703
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:04,159
should be 10 indigenous businesses in

704
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,760
queensland all all

705
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:09,760
competing um for for these projects

706
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:11,279
and and and hopefully putting back in

707
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,840
this community

708
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:14,880
um the other thing that i wanted to to

709
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,158
talk to you about

710
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,679
uh and to give you some education around

711
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:21,279
another way of overcoming some of these

712
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,480
barriers or kryptonite

713
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,640
to what we're trying to do around

714
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,799
diversity inclusion our reconciliation

715
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,520
action plans now i'm fairly certain

716
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,559
that we're all conscious of the concept

717
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,120
of

718
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,600
an iso certification framework is simply

719
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:35,120
a

720
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:38,559
framework for the way that the

721
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:41,840
organization holds information

722
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:44,720
a reconciliation action plan is is

723
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,480
is simple yet incredibly powerful it

724
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,840
outlines the steps an organization will

725
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,799
need to take to build strong

726
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,158
relationships and

727
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:54,480
and respect the key word their respect

728
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:56,159
between non-indigenous people and and

729
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:59,120
first nations australians

730
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,000
and it it lays down a framework for

731
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,840
tangible social

732
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,600
change in fact a recent report

733
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,439
shows that reconciliation action plans

734
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,799
are helping to close the gap in

735
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,880
employment between indigenous and

736
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:14,158
non-indigenous australians

737
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,520
a rat plan um

738
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:17,360
and i'll share the links with you at the

739
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,639
end of this speech but uh the wrap plan

740
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,439
helps to create more

741
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,799
dynamic and diverse workplace which

742
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,720
which is a more understanding and

743
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:26,559
therefore more tolerant and different

744
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,120
a different tolerance of different

745
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:31,360
cultures which can only be a good thing

746
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,360
for for australia right if we're just a

747
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,479
more tolerant in

748
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,879
in our workplace i think that

749
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,799
ict will start to present itself as a

750
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,840
more inclusive environment for first

751
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:43,840
nations participation

752
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,080
so what's the bloody solution to all

753
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,240
this kryptonite talk um

754
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,918
because i i do find that a lot of people

755
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,679
talk um

756
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,080
and there's not a lot of action and and

757
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:59,840
that's why a couple of slides ago

758
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,678
we sort of we had a quick chat about um

759
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,600
sometimes people wait for the government

760
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,320
to mandate something

761
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,840
and then we'll do it now please don't be

762
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,760
that person that waits for something to

763
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:12,399
be mandated before it becomes bloody

764
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,400
common sense

765
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,480
the same concept about getting in your

766
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,760
car and putting your seatbelt on

767
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,760
because it's common sense

768
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,760
that's where we want to get to and it's

769
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,720
going to need it's going to need a

770
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,120
combined effort

771
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:28,240
of everybody in the sector from from the

772
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,719
reseller

773
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,760
to the vendor that we represent to the

774
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,159
customers

775
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,120
to the disneys we all need to come

776
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,200
together and

777
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,279
actors act as the superheroes for

778
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,080
diversity and inclusion

779
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,919
um in keeping with the theme we can all

780
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,039
be superheroes and yes we can we can all

781
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:48,080
be superheroes

782
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:49,600
if we just do the little things right we

783
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,240
don't need to

784
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:53,439
um you know rattle the cage and put our

785
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,000
employment at risk by

786
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,039
you know challenging the status quo but

787
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,880
certainly from our

788
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:02,400
perspective um as being an an innovative

789
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,880
uh partner to state and federal

790
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,360
government and the asx top 100

791
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,200
we know only full well that we are

792
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:11,840
challenging the status quo

793
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,799
uh in in procurement and in in technical

794
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:16,080
teams

795
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:19,600
um but it's just really wonderful when

796
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:22,720
customers and decision makers

797
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:24,480
just give us a go because that in my

798
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,559
mind is being a superhero it's just

799
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,840
saying we'll give you a go

800
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:31,120
and we won't assess you on your culture

801
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,918
or the culture of the people you

802
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,959
represent

803
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,240
we will assess you on your capability uh

804
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:39,120
and i think that is

805
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,640
is what what we all want as human beings

806
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,760
just to be assessed on our capability

807
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,120
whether you're

808
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,960
black or white gay or straight um

809
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,199
regardless of your religious beliefs

810
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,240
just can you do the job that we're being

811
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,320
asked of you yes

812
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,520
is it within the budget envelope yes do

813
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,879
you have all the appropriate

814
00:27:53,520 --> 00:28:00,480
uh insurances and and uh that we need to

815
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,399
to give ourselves some some some uh

816
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,840
some comfort that you guys can can cover

817
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,360
us yes we can do you have some

818
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,199
references yes

819
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,879
well then instead of instead of asking

820
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,960
why indigenous business

821
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,360
to provide the outcome i'd kind of flip

822
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,960
it on its head and i'd say well

823
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,959
perhaps we should be asking ourselves as

824
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,039
a sector why not

825
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,559
well why not the government's leading

826
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,360
the way and someone in some of their

827
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,039
procurement

828
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,879
policies cert certainly from a new south

829
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,799
wales government perspective uh and a

830
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:28,799
victorian government perspective

831
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,320
in black and white it's in the

832
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:32,799
procurement policy

833
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:35,520
that is is reported on an estate-based

834
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:35,520
level to say

835
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:40,399
services that that you're after as a

836
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,158
procurement professional

837
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,000
if the certain goods and services can be

838
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:46,799
found from an indigenous business

839
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,080
first then you don't need to test the

840
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,559
market

841
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,439
in fact you're you're well within your

842
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,480
rights

843
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:57,279
to start commercial negotiations with

844
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,880
that indigenous supplier

845
00:28:57,279 --> 00:29:00,880
now think about that for a moment about

846
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,600
this idea about in i.t

847
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,760
security getting and from a cso's

848
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:08,080
perspective and a cio's perspective

849
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,879
getting the security control that you

850
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:12,000
want

851
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:15,200
today to fix the problem that exists

852
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,880
today not in three months time once

853
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,480
a testing the market process has

854
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,200
happened and once we've evaluated three

855
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:24,240
quotes from 15 different suppliers

856
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,600
we want a control to fit now there

857
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:28,559
aren't many organizations

858
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:29,520
in australia that can effectively

859
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:34,080
navigate

860
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:37,120
some of the procurement um processes

861
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,120
whilst supporting and encouraging

862
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,559
property every step of the way

863
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,959
there aren't too many organizations that

864
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,720
can do this that are welcome with open

865
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,480
arms and state and federal government

866
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:50,240
other than indigenous business providers

867
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:52,720
of goods and services and in this

868
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:55,760
instance we're talking about security

869
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,039
so in my mind growing up as a as a young

870
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:00,960
boy in my mind

871
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:04,480
um superheroes were always supportive

872
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:07,520
uh kind patient

873
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,039
knowledgeable and just like clark kent

874
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,200
they did the right thing even when no

875
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:14,640
one was looking

876
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,760
so i firmly believe that excuse me

877
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,320
that in many years to come we will have

878
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,919
an i.t

879
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,439
sector that is so supportive of

880
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:23,120
indigenous inclusion

881
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,720
and diversity that many of the

882
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,439
superheroes that have picked up

883
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,720
the challenge today and i hope that many

884
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,120
of you do

885
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,480
will pass on that cape and mask to the

886
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,600
next generation

887
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:39,039
of superheroes so we get to a stage

888
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,678
where this idea about diversity and

889
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,640
inclusion

890
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,399
doesn't take cognitive thought process

891
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,960
it just happens

892
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:48,320
i think that would be a wonderful place

893
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,840
for us all

894
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,678
to be um i for those of you who are

895
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,360
interested i i can share

896
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,880
uh sorry that that concludes the the

897
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,320
formal process of

898
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,919
of the uh of the chat um i wanted to

899
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,240

nation and what that organization

902
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:12,960
represents to reconciliation

903
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:16,158
org.iu uh certainly from a a

904
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:18,799
um from a state-based perspective i i'm

905
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:22,240
well-versed in queensland government

906
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:24,720
policy but i can guide people towards

907
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,919
um the state-based if you are a

908
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,440
state-based procurement

909
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,679
professional or a state-based security

910
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,399
guy i can guide you towards

911
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,760
some of the beautifully written

912
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:36,959
procurement policies that

913
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:39,440
set out to create a fairer and more

914
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:42,559
equitable

915
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:45,200
society they've been well written and

916
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:47,200
and sometimes i think their beauty is in

917
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,080
their simplicity

918
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,720
and also to draw your attention to a

919
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,720
program

920
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:58,000
in canada called connected north um

921
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,320
there is a fantastic program where like

922
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,200
in australia um first nations

923
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,158
communities are

924
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,440
affected by the tyranny of distance and

925
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,320
there has been a vendor

926
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,120
um collaborate with the canadian

927
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,799
government

928
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:12,719
to create a program called connected

929
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:14,399
north and through technology

930
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,880
we are starting to bridge the gap and

931
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:19,840
close that gap of distance between

932
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,559
first nations communities in canada and

933
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,959
um

934
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:24,720
and labrador and british columbia and i

935
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,200
just think to myself

936
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,000
you know guys if new zealand can do it

937
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,240
and canada

938
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,760
can do it then why the bloody hell can't

939
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,799
we do it of course we can

940
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:36,799
i just think we all need to be um you

941
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:39,360
know a little bit more superhero

942
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,879
and a little bit less let's just wait

943
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,360
for someone else to do it for us

944
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,039
i think we need to to all step up so i'm

945
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,479
going to um

946
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:48,559
i don't know what i'm going to do i'm

947
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,519
just going to stop sharing something and

948
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,519
click on something else

949
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:57,678
thank you very much for that pit

950
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,639

or do throw them in uh in the q a

953
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,000
section

954
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,600
uh we do have a little bit of time but

955
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,559
first and foremost i'd like to say thank

956
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,199
you very much pip

957
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:10,879
it's not never easy kind of jumping into

958
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:13,679
a presentation very last minute

959
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,039
um so on behalf of us i'd really like to

960
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,039
thank you for that

961
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,080
and i like to kind of pick out a point

962
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,200
that you made

963
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:24,559
around the paralysis aspect of it so you

964
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:27,120
you're 100 spot on um the fact that

965
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:28,799
i think a lot of people don't know what

966
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,320
what the right thing to say is

967
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,960
or how to go about it so they don't say

968
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,559
anything at all so

969
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,320
i mentioned just before you talk that

970
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:38,559
this topic is quite near and dear to my

971
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,600
heart because my partner's indigenous

972
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:42,639
so um you know she's from uh the you can

973
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:45,519
be a nation

974
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,559
on the wall and around and around logan

975
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,440
um

976
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,840
and you know her her father's an elder

977
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,600
and

978
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,600
and all that kind of stuff so he is

979
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,639
involved quite heavily in the community

980
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:57,678
so on the paralysis perspective not

981
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,840
everyone's as fortunate

982
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,440
as i personally am to just go up to her

983
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:03,199
and ask a question it might be stupid

984
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,200
and most likely is

985
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,039
but you know not everyone is fortunate

986
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,440
enough to go up and have a person on

987
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,960
hand

988
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,639
you know through through which they can

989
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,280
ask those types of questions

990
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,760
so my question to you would be um what

991
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,440
would be

992
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,040
the the appropriate approach or are

993
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,639
there any kind of mechanisms out there

994
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,639
that people can ask those questions

995
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,919
without feeling a little bit silly or

996
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:25,679
maybe you feel

997
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:27,839
like they are naive

998
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:29,359
yeah oh mate i can say it's a it's a and

999
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,719
thank you for the vote of confidence and

1000
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,319
thank you for the little story i

1001
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,359
deliberately finished a little bit early

1002
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,720
so we could have these

1003
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,119
open discussions so um so so my go-to

1004
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,959

if i have a if i have a a thought

1009
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,159

letters low cut back off the kiwis

1018
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,839
in 1981 the first time since 1947

1019
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,920
um he was inducted into the rugby hall

1020
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,680
of fame he retired from rugby union when

1021
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,079
he was 25

1022
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:18,160
and he played and the three boys uh ella

1023
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,440
boyz played in an era where racism was

1024
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,359
open

1025
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,359
and so mark now is the executive

1026
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:26,640
director of sbs

1027
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:28,720
sports over the black dot nitv

1028
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,680
and he's all about creating role models

1029
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,040
outside of sport

1030
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,919
because he knows that not everyone is

1031
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:36,400
gifted at sport as the yellow family

1032
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,680
but to answer your questions succinctly

1033
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,760
so i'm fortunate like you

1034
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:41,279
of having that go-to guy that that we

1035
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:43,040
just ask a question over

1036
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,480
over a phone call and say is this the

1037
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:47,200
right way of framing or is it

1038
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,560
not um i think that there's two things

1039
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,960
that we could probably look at

1040
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,680
i think the first one is i genuinely

1041
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,560
believe

1042
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,839
that there is such a profound uh sense

1043
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,200
of ignorance when it comes to these

1044
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:58,720
subjects that i think that every

1045
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:01,040
organization needs to

1046
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,118
invest in cultural sensitivity training

1047
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,680
i think that we need to

1048
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,520
really understand uh what it is that

1049
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,319
first nations people

1050
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,880
bring to this to the sector that's the

1051
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,640
first thing

1052
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,000
that's a formal approach right where we

1053
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:16,720
educate ourselves to

1054
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,839
to break down those um that ignorance

1055
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,000
that's up here

1056
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:23,040
the the next thing uh is up to the

1057
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,920
individual and this is the concept that

1058
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,640
if we do good only good will follow

1059
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:30,079
right so

1060
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:31,598
if we are someone that we know um

1061
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,520
i mean i'm certainly not proposing just

1062
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,720
going up on you know to a first nations

1063
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,759
man or woman on the street and asking

1064
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,759
them for their opinion

1065
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,520
that's probably not a good idea but if

1066
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,160
there is a way that we can we can

1067
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,800
communicate

1068
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:44,240
either through um you know volunteering

1069
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,079
for for indigenous

1070
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,000
organizations but i think that there's

1071
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,800
this concept that

1072
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,359
i think what you know it's not just

1073
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,240
indigenous

1074
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:55,040
people it's men and women in wheelchairs

1075
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,799
you know

1076
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,400
we don't want to skirt around the issue

1077
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,000
we don't want people to feel sorry for

1078
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,640
us we don't want people to

1079
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:04,000
to um to jump around just just come out

1080
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,520
and ask the question i think if it's

1081
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,200
coming from a good

1082
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,200
if if the question itself is coming from

1083
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:12,879
a good um point of view or

1084
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:15,439
a good um what's the word good angle

1085
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,720
rather than being a a you know a

1086
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,560
malicious question

1087
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,160
if it's coming from a sense of hey look

1088
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,440
i just want to know i want to be

1089
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,598
educated i want to learn

1090
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:25,280
i don't want to be like everybody else i

1091
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:28,400
want to be better

1092
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,480
can you help me is this the right way of

1093
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,000
pronouncing jugembear is this the right

1094
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,800
way of giving an acknowledgment of

1095
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
country

1096
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,280
what's the difference between an

1097
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,119
acknowledgement of country and a welcome

1098
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,839
the country these are all things that we

1099
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,480
should know

1100
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:41,920
australia should know like hands down

1101
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,079
and it should be taught in school i hope

1102
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:46,720
to god it is i'm too old now 44.

1103
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:48,640
but i hope to god it is taught in school

1104
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,319
i hope so too uh it wasn't taught when i

1105
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:52,799
was going through school and that was

1106
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:54,800
a little while ago as well um and a kind

1107
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,640
of follow-up question as well do you

1108
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,800
do do you see it improving from your

1109
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,960
perspective from what you see

1110
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,839
um you know particularly in queensland

1111
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:04,560
um do you

1112
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,359
do you see you know it actually

1113
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,359
improving

1114
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:09,839
um from that perspective do you see a

1115
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:11,759
lot more indigenous than first nations

1116
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:13,599
actually wanting to get into information

1117
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,000
technology or cyber security which is

1118
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:20,480
even more niche

1119
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,320
yeah uh well look um

1120
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,079
now wait man i'm not gonna suggest it

1121
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:27,520
but um

1122
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:31,200
i see it improving but very slowly um

1123
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:33,119
you know i i i'm fortunate enough to to

1124
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,359
to take that veil of ignorance off my

1125
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:37,280
head once i started to investigate

1126
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:38,400
um and and consult like you would with

1127
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,480
elders i consult with

1128
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,440
with traditional owners from juvent and

1129
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:42,880
i consult with

1130
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,960
you know the markels of the world that

1131
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:47,680
represent um

1132
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,520
this idea about overcoming diversity and

1133
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:51,200
and building resilience and never giving

1134
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,400
up and being a role model

1135
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:57,439
for for jonathan thurston um

1136
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,920
i i i think that we have a long long way

1137
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,640
to go

1138
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,280
but you know someone once wiser than me

1139
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,040
um

1140
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,320
said that if we don't you know best time

1141
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,400
to plan a treat

1142
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:09,119
was 20 years ago the second best time is

1143
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,040
today and if we don't start today

1144
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,800
and we've got all of these beautiful

1145
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,680
policies and procedures in place to

1146
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,920
support

1147
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,040
capable indigenous businesses across a

1148
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:20,560
vast array of

1149
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:22,160
of capability not just technology

1150
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,759
then when are we going to start and

1151
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:25,440
that's a question that we need to ask

1152
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,839
our customers and our vendors

1153
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,119
and and resellers and the whole

1154
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:31,119
community because it takes a

1155
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,800
village to raise a child i'm not

1156
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:34,640
proposing that baitum can do this on its

1157
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:37,760
own because it certainly cannot

1158
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:40,000
but in two years for us to be able to

1159
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,920
provide the first

1160
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,680
indigenous supplied scholarship to the

1161
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,720
university of queensland

1162
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,640
in two years i respectfully lay down the

1163
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:52,319
gauntlet to many of my non-indigenous

1164
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,319
competitors to say what are you doing

1165
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,160
definitely well i have many more

1166
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,160
questions i'm sure

1167
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,279
other people have have some questions as

1168
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,720
well but we'll kind of

1169
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:02,640
run out of time there but thank you very

1170
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:04,078
much pip and thanks again for jumping

1171
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:05,920
very last minute and a fantastic

1172
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,839
presentation

1173
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:11,839
my pleasure lucas it's lovely to see you

1174
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:11,839
