1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,040
hey guys welcome back i hope you enjoyed

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,680
the uh

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,040
sessions this morning our next speaker

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,360
is michael marriott so

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,678
michael is a senior strategy and

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,360
research analyst at digital shadows

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,039
so he's written numerous articles and

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,359
papers and is regularly published as

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,039
well

10
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,359
and he's going to be talking about

11
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,680
account tagovers targeting australia

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,960
so i think michael has just arrived into

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,840
the room and we'll switch over to him

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,199
momentarily

15
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,000
but if you guys have any questions just

16
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,320
post them up on the um the q a

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
thanks very much all right hello

18
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,719
everybody thanks for joining

19
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,079
i know it's it's getting towards the end

20
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,960
of the sessions now

21
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,239
penultimate final push so i appreciate

22
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,000
you taking the time

23
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,078
out of what's probably your work day to

24
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,280
come and come and listen here

25
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:52,879
um i i'm going to try and keep this

26
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,399
as educational as possible um

27
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,320
i know a lot of you haven't joined to

28
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,359
hear a vendor talk

29
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,640
so um there will be a small element of

30
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,079
digital shadows in its

31
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,320
solution searchlight but i'm going to

32
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,119
try and keep it uh looking at some

33
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,600
cybercrime trends that we've seen and

34
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,680
some

35
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,880
some free advice at the end and some

36
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,400
resources that you can take away because

37
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,560
i think that's all was a nice thing to

38
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,439
have so

39
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,200
we've got about 30 minutes uh i'm gonna

40
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,199
first outline why people care

41
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,240
about account takeover that probably

42
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,720
seems like an

43
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,240
obvious point uh but there's a bit of

44
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,798
framing that i think it needs to start

45
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,479
with

46
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,000
um we'll then move on to what i think's

47
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,000
the the sexy stuff

48
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,280
uh talking about what we've seen in the

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,880
criminal underground

50
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,119
um and some of the trends that we've

51
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,399
seen there and then we'll finish on some

52
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,799
tools to combat

53
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,960
credential exposure and this reuse of

54
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:47,759
passwords that we see as rampant

55
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,520
both from a free perspective and also

56
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,680
what we're seeing in terms of

57
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:54,240
how we can help clients solve some of

58
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,280
the issues that are associated with all

59
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,360
of this

60
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,159
this noise that comes from these

61
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,159
criminal forums

62
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:08,478
so i think just starting off at a really

63
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,160
really high level um we all

64
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,720
have been talking about the new normal

65
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,079
of cobid and whatnot and

66
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,760
we know that we've got a lot of remote

67
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,800
workers we know we've got a

68
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,200
expanding attack surface we know now

69
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,760
that

70
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,958
we've talked before about the the castle

71
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,720
walls and the perimeter

72
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,000
we've got loads of stuff that protects

73
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,400
that perimeter

74
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,080
but whilst we were talking maybe four

75
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,440
years ago about how the

76
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,080
the perimeter doesn't really exist

77
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,920
anymore and that was quite a novel idea

78
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,360
not really such a novel idea anymore

79
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:40,079
especially with everything that's

80
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,840
that's happened recently now

81
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,239
particularly with

82
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,280
brands and organizations that are quite

83
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,879
public facing

84
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,319
they're really understanding that you

85
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,879
can't delineate

86
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,000
how you look online with the type of

87
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,560
security that we're

88
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,280
trying to approach within the network as

89
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,000
well

90
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,040
so i've just flashed up some things that

91
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,080
we commonly see

92
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,000
whether that's misconfigured devices the

93
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,720
use of shadow i.t

94
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,599
vulnerabilities on all of these growing

95
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,120
end points

96
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:13,040
that you have we're also developing more

97
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,680
and more applications

98
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,040
so we're seeing a lot of leakage around

99
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,599
there we're seeing

100
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,120
developers or contractors with really

101
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,040
sensitive information

102
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,480
that's just being made publicly

103
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,200
available

104
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,798
and we know that attackers are just

105
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,920
absolutely loving all of this

106
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:33,120
and it's just making life so much easier

107
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,640
for the attackers who are

108
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,000
just surveilling for this information

109
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,599
and using it as part of their campaigns

110
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,680
and then you've got the impersonation of

111
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:44,560
your online as well so domains and

112
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,239
fishing kits and things like that i

113
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
think the one thing that always comes up

114
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,680
though

115
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:53,040
is the topic of this talk and that's

116
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,200
employee credentials um

117
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,200
especially now everybody's signing up

118
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,640
for loads of different online services

119
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,480
but realistically this has been

120
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,040
happening for a long time

121
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,560
um even on sites you wouldn't expect

122
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,560
people to be using their

123
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,879
their corporate email addresses um i

124
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,519
always remember we were pretty shocked

125
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,760
at the amount of corporate email

126
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,280
addresses we saw in when ashley madison

127
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:18,159
got breached for example

128
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,279
so this is something that is really

129
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,120
tangible

130
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:25,119
really really is something that

131
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,479
security teams can do something about as

132
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,479
well so it's a high risk

133
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,758
if those accounts get taken over but

134
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,599
it's something that you can actually go

135
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,639
into action and you can show some really

136
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,720
good metrics

137
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,440
in terms of the security team's

138
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,440
effectiveness

139
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,159
and this is another reason why account

140
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,280
took over is

141
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,560
just so much front of mind for a lot of

142
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:50,239
the security teams that we

143
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:53,520
talk to i one of my favorite activities

144
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,000
of the year is to read the verizon dbir

145
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,599
in this one very similar to in previous

146
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,400
years

147
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,120
the main way just the tried and tested

148
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,159
technique

149
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,199
of attackers is just the reuse of

150
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:08,160
credentials

151
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:10,000
and this is there was this is this

152
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,560
year's verizon tbi but i think

153
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,039
maybe eight years ago there was a great

154
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,240
quote

155
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,639
which was basically why use

156
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,280
a cruise missile when the front door is

157
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,160
open

158
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,080
so you're not having people generally

159
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,440
for most organizations the threat model

160
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,440
isn't a zero day or even a

161
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,800
newly released exploit for a new

162
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,479
vulnerability

163
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,960
it's just something really easy it's the

164
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,960
reuse of your employees credentials

165
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,719
that's just providing such an easy way

166
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,520
into the organization

167
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,280
and you may say well we've got to have

168
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,919
multi-factor authentication what are we

169
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:46,479
doing why

170
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,320
do we not have that um the reality is

171
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:51,919
that obviously it's a business decision

172
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,479
and it's somewhat more complex than that

173
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:54,799
and

174
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,680
even on top of that we've seen plenty of

175
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,720
attackers

176
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,000
bypassing um different second factor

177
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,199
authentication so

178
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,520
uh particularly sms based so that is

179
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:06,560
not unheard of but i'm sure many of you

180
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,000
listening in will be

181
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,000
familiar with that anyway

182
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,160
so given that this is such a

183
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,280
large area of interest we we conducted a

184
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,440
good amount of research

185
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,520
probably a month ago this is pretty

186
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:26,800
fresh um we've got

187
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,240
a repository of about at the time it was

188
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,080
15 billion

189
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,440
when we kicked off the research in june

190
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,840
this year

191
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,479
that has since grown by about a billion

192
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,198
and a half

193
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,520
so that gives you an idea of the the

194
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,720
rate at which credentials are being

195
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,000
exposed online so there's a lot there

196
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:45,919
and we thought well why don't we dig

197
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,160
into it and see

198
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,440
not all credentials are created equal so

199
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,199
what are the trends that we're seeing

200
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,599
what's most attractive

201
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,319
for threat actors and what can we

202
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,280
understand

203
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,639
about that that perhaps informs our own

204
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:01,520
defenses

205
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,319
so i thought i would take a snapshot of

206
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,599
that that was

207
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,039
australia focused um because it just

208
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,840
makes it a bit more interesting

209
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,039
and there is a surprising but not really

210
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,280
surprising there is

211
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,039
a significant amount of activity

212
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,080
targeting australia hence

213
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:20,639
the title of this talk i guess so this

214
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:24,159
one was just from a couple of weeks ago

215
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,560
um from a an actor on

216
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,360
a well-known russian cyber criminal

217
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,720
forum

218
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,759
called rot so this is this actor

219
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,039
he's logged on good evening fellas he

220
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,759
specializes in

221
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,719
australian stuff and particularly he's

222
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,960
got a poncho

223
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,720
for uh financial services companies but

224
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,520
doesn't doesn't stop there

225
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,319
there's plenty more um fish in the sea

226
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,000
that he's

227
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:52,800
seeking to sell access to and this is

228
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,520
in this case i think it was a citrix

229
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,800
logon

230
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,318
um he was or this individual was looking

231
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,560
to basically sell a username and

232
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:02,319
password that would provide access to

233
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,240
a whole ton of really sensitive

234
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,520
information and this is something that

235
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,120
we've been seeing

236
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,440
an awful lot of not just in australia

237
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,400
but

238
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,680
across the world so i took just the

239
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,679
australian examples

240
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,800
for this presentation and some that

241
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,879
we've seen in the last

242
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,240
few months in terms of the actors that

243
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,080
are selling access

244
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:26,879
um perhaps we have seen a big uptick

245
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,479
in the last few months um and perhaps

246
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,120
that's related to expanding attack

247
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:34,159
services perhaps it's just a trend

248
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,959
we've seen things like particularly the

249
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,399
selling of

250
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:42,159
rdp access or domain admin these are the

251
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:42,159
ones that are the

252
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,399
the sexiest the the best level of

253
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,519
credential that attackers have to offer

254
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,560
they go for the

255
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,680
the big bucks so while you can pick up

256
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,680
any

257
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,199
you can probably pick up a credential

258
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,000
for a dollar

259
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,480
on most dark web marketplaces you'll

260
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,240
find

261
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,839
that predictably these domain admin

262
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,000
accesses they go from

263
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:05,519
between two thousand and six thousand

264
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,080
dollars apiece

265
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,839
so these individuals they don't want to

266
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,640
take on the risk they don't want to be

267
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,440
actually going and looking to monetize

268
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,680
um

269
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,880
the databases or what you can get from

270
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,479
the access and do

271
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,000
lateral movement and things they just

272
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:22,320
want a quick sell so they've got the

273
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,800
access somehow maybe they've exploited

274
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,080
some

275
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,319
vulnerability or used some default rdp

276
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,920
credentials or whatever they've got

277
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,800
access and they're just selling it on to

278
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,920
the highest bidder

279
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,439
so they're often doing it on auctions

280
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,439
that tends to be a really popular way of

281
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,200
driving up the value but

282
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,600
this is this is really becoming

283
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,440
something that's that's pretty popular

284
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:48,399
um it's it's something that we've seen

285
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,440
changes in as well so previously maybe a

286
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,320
year ago

287
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,440
somebody would come on and say i've got

288
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,560
access to

289
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,920
such a such bank called such university

290
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,479
and then they would just have a bidding

291
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,000
war and it turns out that um

292
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,360
that people are monitoring for this so

293
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,160
they have to be a bit more cryptic about

294
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,320
it so

295
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,839
there's often a bit of a jigsaw puzzle

296
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,640
that you have to put together so they

297
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,480
give a

298
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,399
they give an alexa ranking number of

299
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,720
employees and they try and mask it like

300
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:14,399
that

301
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,640
but but still be as appealing as

302
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,880
possible so we've got our own close

303
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,600
sources team that go and

304
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:24,800
try and ascertain whether those belong

305
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,360
to our clients or anything like that

306
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,560
but these are these are absolutely the

307
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,000
some of the most valuable

308
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,640
that attackers seek and sell online we

309
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,880
did

310
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,640
as part of the research and you'll all

311
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,040
be able to have a copy of this research

312
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,399
after the presentation as part of it we

313
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,240
did a broader analysis

314
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,320
not just in australia but across the

315
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,320
world in 2020

316
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,600
what the average price is for different

317
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,959
types of industry

318
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,000
domain admin access were so we've broken

319
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,518
them down there

320
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,040
and the the highest cost of those were

321
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,120
for local government

322
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,880
and there were quite a few listings

323
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,640
there i think

324
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,920
that's probably in line with a lot of

325
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,519
the uh

326
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,680
a lot of the ransomware targeting as

327
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,800
well and there's i won't go into in this

328
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,319
presentation but i think there's

329
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,479
probably a

330
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:15,600
correlation between the selling of rdp

331
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,360
access credentials and the ability to

332
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,200
execute ransomware in different

333
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:21,519
environments so

334
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,560
these tend to be the ones that are being

335
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,320
traded

336
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,160
online obviously there's a big chunk of

337
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,760
other that tended to be

338
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,839
a mix of higher education and

339
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,839
a bit of retail as well from my

340
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:36,880
recollection

341
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:38,079
so just to give you an idea um when we

342
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,600
think of credentials we often think

343
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:41,120
about those low-level ones or the ones

344
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,079
that are just freely available floating

345
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,480
around but

346
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:48,079
there is a bit of a trove that is some

347
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,079
pretty high value stuff

348
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,120
and then the second high value thing um

349
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,639
now this was

350
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,639
this is a little bit further back this

351
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:58,560
is about a year ago but it was

352
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:00,079
something that has always stuck with me

353
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,000
um

354
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,120
because of its nature and i'll go into

355
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,160
it but

356
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:09,279
we our close sources team engaged with

357
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,439
a russian-speaking cyber criminal and

358
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,760
this one is across a

359
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,120
a messaging platform it was a jabber

360
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,160
conversation

361
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,959
so we were we were discussing with this

362
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,560
one individual

363
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:26,399
and they were explicitly looking for

364
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:28,399
um certain email address inbox access

365
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,760
so thereafter and you can see possibly

366
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,639
on the screen if you've got it

367
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,680
helpful accounts payable accounts

368
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,800
receivables

369
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,319
payables and receivables and

370
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,240
i think this now seems like a really

371
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,920
obvious point to me but

372
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,079
when i used to think of corporate emails

373
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,439
i thought of gym in accounting

374
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:49,199
or um just somebody else in

375
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,959
a different department than but it was

376
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:52,639
it was their inbox

377
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,719
and this really woke me up to the fact

378
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,160
that well actually why would it not be

379
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,720
these departmental

380
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:59,519
inboxes these have got way more valuable

381
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,320
information

382
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,760
if you think about the types of invoices

383
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,519
and

384
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,880
payment information that's available if

385
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,880
you were to have access

386
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,320
to these type of inboxes it would be

387
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:13,600
absolutely massive

388
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:17,200
so this this individual they

389
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:20,160
provided a list of exactly actually 100

390
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:21,200
companies that were located in both

391
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:25,519
australia

392
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:28,480
and in the uk and those companies were

393
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,040
generally manufacturing companies or

394
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,720
they were

395
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:35,439
financial services related specifically

396
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,079
to the manufacturing industry and those

397
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:39,360
looking at

398
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:42,638
a rental so it was an incredibly

399
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,120
targeted orchestrated attempt to get

400
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,079
these inboxes and the credentials for

401
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,240
them

402
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:53,199
and is even more surprising was that

403
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,880
we think in terms of the prices of

404
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:55,920
things going in the criminal underground

405
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,320
you'd think that

406
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:00,479
maybe getting a nice piece of malware or

407
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:03,040
an exploit for something would would

408
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,839
reach the highest cost and actually no

409
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,160
it was

410
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,959
somebody goes the effort to get

411
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,399
something

412
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,319
from an inbox with accounting

413
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,920
information in that's the thing that was

414
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,800
getting i think tens of thousands of

415
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,160
dollars

416
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,680
was was the offer for that so a huge

417
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:21,519
amount of money going around

418
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,519
and looking for these types of things

419
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,439
so this is i said this was in the back

420
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,199
of my mind so when we were doing this

421
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,040
research i really wanted to understand

422
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,680
well i wonder

423
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,839
just by pure chance of the people that

424
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,599
are using these online accounting tools

425
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:39,680
how many people have used these

426
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,519
corporate um

427
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,359
payments in boxes to sign up that have

428
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,519
subsequently been breached

429
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:46,800
so we had a little look in it turns out

430
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:49,279
there's an awful lot

431
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,319
that were being used in fact there were

432
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,760
two million

433
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,800
uh accounting inboxes that are exposed

434
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:58,480
online freely in circulation across the

435
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,319
criminal underground

436
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,480
and i i expected that to be a good

437
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,120
amount i did not expect them to be two

438
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,519
million

439
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,800
and you can see the distribution here uh

440
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,160
invoice invoices

441
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,040
partners vendors billing admin so on and

442
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,319
so forth

443
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,519
so this admittedly was based on a large

444
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,760
data sample

445
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:19,040
we were looking at about 15 billion

446
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,600
credentials here

447
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,959
i think still though two million

448
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,680
accounting inboxes

449
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:28,880
is is a number that we should definitely

450
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,880
be paying attention to

451
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:34,479
especially as uh about

452
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,920
90 of the passwords that we found within

453
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,440
those 15 billion

454
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,959
were already in plain text so

455
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,880
i don't need to emphasize the

456
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,800
significance of that that

457
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,759
just makes it so much easier for

458
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,120
attackers particularly as i'll go on to

459
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:51,680
the ones that are using these

460
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:54,240
credentials to brute force

461
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,479
to put into a credential stuffing tool

462
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,279
that then automatically goes and

463
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:00,000
looks up and looks a valid um credential

464
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,040
pairs

465
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:05,759
so incredibly easy for attackers 90

466
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,560
and even the rest of them the remaining

467
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,320
10

468
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:12,160
that are not plain text they're in a

469
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,920
format that

470
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:19,040
it doesn't need a a nation-state

471
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,399
side a nation-state adversary to to go

472
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,680
and actually understand

473
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:24,399
what that password is so awful lot of

474
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,319
passwords

475
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:30,560
awful lot of censored information and

476
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,560
it's a pretty low barrier to entry

477
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:39,199
we also distributed it um based on the

478
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:42,480
average number of credentials

479
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,479
per organization per sector so

480
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,639
you can see across a few of these we

481
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,240
have we did take a few of these out

482
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,959
of the data sample so particularly

483
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,920
telecommunications if you think about

484
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,920
those that have got

485
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,279
customers who would be using the same

486
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:58,399
email domain

487
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,720
as employees we tried to really focus on

488
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,160
the

489
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,440
employee um credential issue in this

490
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,559
circumstance so

491
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,439
we did remove those in this piece of

492
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,720
analysis

493
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,480
but you can still see just a lot

494
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,160
a lot of credentials that are being

495
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,599
alerted

496
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:20,400
47 603 for

497
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,280
a technology company on average and if

498
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,120
you think about

499
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:26,399
the good number of technology companies

500
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:29,520
that we sampled probably only have

501
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,799
5 000 employees this really gives an

502
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,559
idea of the scale

503
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,600
at which these credentials are being

504
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:37,600
exposed online

505
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,280
so this is something that obviously we

506
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,600
alert our clients to

507
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,720
a lot um there are a lot of credentials

508
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,559
flying around i said

509
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,240
there were a billion and a half in the

510
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,799
last month or so so

511
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,480
an awful lot out there and as i'll get

512
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,039
on to at the end when i show what we're

513
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,760
doing

514
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,320
we're trying to we're trying to find

515
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,280
ways

516
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:59,360
to help organizations triage those work

517
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,570
out whether it's relevant to them

518
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,479
and then actually go and

519
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:04,960
[Music]

520
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,480
validate them before they have to go

521
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,840
through the whole triage process so

522
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,559
we're trying to get to that validation

523
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,480
stage

524
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,678
earlier so that it will just save a

525
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,520
bunch of time

526
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:18,160
so um uh we'll get on to that

527
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:19,280
very shortly one of the the cool tidbits

528
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,280
actually that i always like to bring up

529
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,918
when i'm talking about credentials uh is

530
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,480
nothing on the slide but it's a nice

531
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,200
little

532
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,400
trick that i've learned for sort of

533
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,799
heads of security

534
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,559
that i've chatted to um that are trying

535
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,960
to demonstrate what they're doing

536
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:37,440
particularly to the the c level and

537
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,360
executives who don't perhaps understand

538
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,840
digital risk protection or intelligence

539
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,000
and what's going on in cyber criminal

540
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,399
underground

541
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,120
and so they're trying to make cases that

542
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,520
potentially

543
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,280
when executives travel they end up

544
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,440
exposing themselves

545
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,799
and how can they go and manage that risk

546
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,039
and get awareness of that

547
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,000
so whatever tool you may be using

548
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,640
whatever visibility

549
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,600
you have into credentials one cool thing

550
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:02,000
to do is when

551
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,918
executives get back from a business trip

552
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,160
to russia or china

553
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,280
um what a nice thing to do is actually

554
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,840
go and type in

555
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,240
their email address and show the

556
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,559
timeline of when that was exposed

557
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,320
because i feel that when you start to

558
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,600
bring that to the executive level and

559
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:20,240
you show that actually

560
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,000
tangibly for them here's what's happened

561
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,720
and here's where you're exposed from

562
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,840
that

563
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:28,720
vip level that really starts to resonate

564
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,480
with those individuals and sure shows

565
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,039
what security the value that they're

566
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,000
adding

567
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,799
not they're not just securing things and

568
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,320
devices

569
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,320
they're actually making a business

570
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,600
impact that should really have a

571
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,559
powerful message

572
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,199
um so just a little tip there that i

573
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,600
find

574
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:48,080
helps a lot of people and just from a

575
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,080
personal

576
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:54,000
career-wise

577
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,760
so there are a few things that these uh

578
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,039
these then get used for

579
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:59,760
um so if you think about all of these

580
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:03,440
credentials that are out there um

581
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:05,600
some of these can get used to

582
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,559
just like a straightforward reuse so if

583
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,918
you get these

584
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:09,760
early enough when they're at their

585
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:10,720
highest value when they've just been

586
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,400
breached

587
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,240
um then actually you can go and

588
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,880
potentially reuse those

589
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,720
for another account that tends to have

590
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,640
diminishing returns when those get

591
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:22,159
further and further traded across

592
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,240
different locations

593
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,600
and they get they start to get used

594
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:29,360
quite creatively

595
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:32,158
so perhaps many of you will be

596
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,280
familiar with credential stuffing tools

597
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:35,679
you can see one

598
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,960
uh screenshot that i've thrown up there

599
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:39,440
and there are a few

600
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,320
that are available so for many many

601
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:42,400
years

602
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,000
if any of you were familiar with

603
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:47,919
credential stuffing the name

604
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,960
century mba would would ring true to you

605
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,840
that was the

606
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,640
the absolute uh cool kid on the block

607
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,559
that everybody

608
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,720
would be talking about and getting

609
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,240
different configuration files for and

610
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,640
that's what people would be doing

611
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,720
so for those not familiar you

612
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,280
essentially have this piece of software

613
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:07,360
you throw in a load of previously

614
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,039
breached credential pairs that you know

615
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,639
has come from another site you then

616
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,080
point it at another website

617
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,400
and it just circulates through them

618
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,559
until it finds matches

619
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,679
century mba was really successful

620
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:21,120
because it was able

621
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:24,240
to on occasion bypass capture controls

622
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:25,840
so there was a huge trade in central mba

623
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,400
configuration files to make sure you're

624
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,039
going to

625
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,640
specific sites so that was so popular

626
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:33,600
for many many years

627
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,960
until this year um it's it's actually

628
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,559
we've got a new kid on the block

629
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:41,520
and that kid is open bullet

630
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:42,080
although central mba still is a popular

631
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,240
tool

632
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,918
it's actually we looked at the mentions

633
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,480
i may or may not have a slide on it

634
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:49,679
i don't um but open bullet was actually

635
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,720
far more popular

636
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,919
than center mba now so just an easier to

637
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:57,200
use interface

638
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,120
um that really appealed to people so

639
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,559
just want to be aware of if you do get

640
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,639
asked internally perhaps

641
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,080
you've got to write a report on

642
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,039
credential stuffing because that's been

643
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,360
in the news

644
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,559
send your nba absolutely still won but

645
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:13,840
don't forget about this

646
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,840
this rising star open bullet

647
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,840
that's one angle the other angle which i

648
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:23,039
think is

649
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:26,080
is possibly even cooler is

650
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,200
um one that's emerged in the last we

651
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:30,158
spotted it in

652
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,679
eight i think april 2018 was when this

653
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:34,559
market first emerged

654
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,039
it came out of the uh a very famous

655
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,480
russian

656
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,320
speaking cyber criminal forum called

657
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,600
exploit.n

658
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:43,760
this was was birthed from that community

659
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,959
and advertised heavily on there in early

660
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,879
2018

661
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,480
just as with any tech company they went

662
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,159
through a beta phase

663
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:52,840
where they tested it with trusted

664
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,440
customers but essentially what it is

665
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,879
is what you would previously have to do

666
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,919
when you're committing fraud

667
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:02,320
and the maybe fraud folks uh

668
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,280
that are on the line now so i'm sorry if

669
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,559
i'm butchering

670
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,639
uh how you do your job but and

671
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,918
there's the concept of fingerprinting so

672
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,360
um you

673
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,280
can get a good idea if somebody's

674
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,600
legitimate by things like

675
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,480
their cookies browser information ip

676
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,520
address

677
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,440
um and other little nuggets like that so

678
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:24,480
what a threat actor has to do

679
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,720
is if they want to use an account which

680
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,240
perhaps the four team are monitoring for

681
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,679
suspicious activity

682
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,760
they have to then go and buy a ton of

683
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:35,200
other stuff so they need to go and buy

684
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,720
um different proxies they need to rotate

685
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,159
those they need to work out

686
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,400
what browser information they need to

687
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:42,400
work out the um the zip code or the

688
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,600
postcode of the individual whose account

689
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,919
they're stealing so on

690
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,678
and it's just a massive pain because

691
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,520
it's just a lot of work and

692
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,799
if there's nothing in there it tends to

693
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,080
be a bit of a turn off

694
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:55,520
for the the actual attackers that are

695
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,960
trying to monetize that

696
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,080
so genesis market essentially disrupted

697
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,840
this whole thing

698
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,439
and they said well instead of you

699
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,120
getting all these disparate pieces from

700
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,000
different locations

701
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,520
why not you just you can just rent an

702
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,840
identity for a day

703
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,600
so they provide this website it's got a

704
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,600
chrome extension

705
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:17,520
it turns out russian site criminals love

706
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,000
chrome extensions

707
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,918
and you just rent so you can rent

708
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,159
sebastian for a day

709
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:25,039
and they've got automatic injects that

710
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,520
they've got from

711
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,320
from botnets and different captures

712
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,799
online

713
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,720
and they all combine to form this

714
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:35,679
identity of real world

715
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:37,200
stolen stuff so instead of you getting

716
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,200
an account then having to work out where

717
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,679
they live and then getting proxies and

718
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,480
whatnot all of a sudden you have all of

719
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,240
that

720
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,840
you just rent them you have their screen

721
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,640
size you have their cookie information

722
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,240
you are there

723
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:50,480
you are impersonating them they already

724
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,480
have all of that so

725
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,760
this is a scary i said cool i shouldn't

726
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,720
say cool um

727
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,679
but it's a scary trend that has really

728
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,720
taken off

729
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,679
in the last two years so it is firmly

730
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,480
out of beta

731
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:05,679
stage now uh there's tens of thousands

732
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:09,520
of identities on

733
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:09,919
genesis market um and it continues to

734
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,960
grow

735
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:16,080
today they've got

736
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,720
even got other markets that uh copycat

737
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,840
markets

738
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,120
so tenebrus and underworld market

739
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,360
and the world market used to go by a

740
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:26,559
different name that i have forgotten

741
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,559
but those are now the three biggest and

742
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,960
you can see genesis markets still

743
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,360
absolutely with 65

744
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,720
of of the discussions that we we

745
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,719
analyzed online

746
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,960
focused on genesis market and that

747
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,880
certainly rings true with

748
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,400
its credibility and it's standing within

749
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,400
the cyber criminal community

750
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,559
so yeah that's just one thing um not not

751
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,559
everybody is familiar with so i wanted

752
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:53,360
to share that piece of information

753
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:57,840
about that that new trend in bypassing

754
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,840
fingerprinting controls

755
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,439
okay so um we've got about 10 minutes

756
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,200
left

757
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,520
so i i thought it was important to

758
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,120
finish on on actually what you can do

759
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:09,600
about this

760
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,439
now it's always lovely to chat to

761
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,399
australian security professionals

762
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,440
because

763
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:19,760
one of your own is of course troy hunt

764
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:23,520
who has done an absolutely terrific

765
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:26,158
job of bringing exposed credentials

766
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:28,400
um and breaches really to the forefront

767
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,000
of people's minds and making sure

768
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,840
that they have a way to actually

769
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,120
understand whether they've been involved

770
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,720
in these breaches

771
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:39,120
so often when i can flash up this slide

772
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,640
at the end there's a surprising amount

773
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:43,760
of people that don't actually

774
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,679
know about have i been pwned

775
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,799
i imagine this is slightly different for

776
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,559
this audience

777
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,840
but nonetheless if you don't already

778
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:51,120
know about how i've been poned and

779
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,039
you're not using that

780
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,479
within your business already would

781
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,000
really encourage you to go and check

782
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,159
that out it's something that

783
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,120
is freely available you can do it in a

784
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:00,480
personal level

785
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,080
so you can type in your own email

786
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,200
address in there and see where where

787
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,360
you've been breached and where they've

788
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,840
been reported to have i've been toned

789
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,000
but you can also do it on a your own

790
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,918
domain level so if you can

791
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,520
if you can basically prove ownership of

792
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,000
the domain in the second screenshot

793
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,559
there

794
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,120
you can actually pull back those results

795
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,678
and

796
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,120
get an idea of which of your corporate

797
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,320
email addresses have been involved in

798
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,840
the breaches

799
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,799
so it's not perfect but you for example

800
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,320
that you don't get the

801
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,158
password so it's quite hard to

802
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,799
understand whether it's relevant but

803
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:34,640
it's an absolutely terrific source for

804
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,799
security teams that perhaps

805
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:38,080
can't invest in getting a new threat

806
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,120
intelligence tool or additional risk

807
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,960
protection solution

808
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,879
this is a really really good starting

809
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,760
point particularly if you think about

810
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,720
you know those additional tips for

811
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,640
demonstrating

812
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:52,559
your your what you're doing in terms of

813
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:55,520
the business to the executives

814
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:56,399
so yes troy hun he is incredible

815
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,440
somebody chats in

816
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:00,719
and that is absolutely correct so check

817
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,279
that out if you don't know that already

818
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,320
would

819
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:06,880
very much encourage you to do so

820
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:07,360
i reference a lot of the material in

821
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,640
here

822
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:12,479
not all of it is available within this

823
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:15,039
report which goes into a lot of detail

824
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,360
about not only things like open bullet

825
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,399
but

826
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:21,199
also other tools we also looked into

827
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:22,719
um specifically dark web marketplaces so

828
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,600
looking at the different trades and

829
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,919
different goods

830
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,360
what's going on there essentially trying

831
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:31,039
to demystify

832
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,879
um the the dark web community

833
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:34,399
because i think it does need a bit of

834
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,760
demystifying there's

835
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:41,600
plenty of risk on the non-dark web

836
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,600
um that perhaps we can talk about

837
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,480
afterwards

838
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:48,479
and then i thought i'd just finish by

839
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:49,840
talking about what what digital shadows

840
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,399
and what searchlight are doing

841
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,080
within this and i just flash up this

842
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:57,600
again to remind people that

843
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:59,360
most of these 16 or 15 or 16 billion

844
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,520
credentials are actually in plain text

845
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,559
so this is a huge number and potentially

846
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,760
a little bit overwhelming for

847
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:06,080
organizations

848
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,120
but it also provides this it's enormous

849
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,799
opportunity

850
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,639
because if they're already in this

851
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:12,000
format and there's so many of them and

852
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,080
we need to reduce that to more of a

853
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,440
sensible number the security doesn't

854
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,199
necessarily have time to be going

855
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,559
through all of these we can actually go

856
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,919
and validate those

857
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:23,600
so as well as just alerting on every new

858
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,520
credential that we see

859
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,840
we realize that's just too much for

860
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:31,679
organizations and most security teams

861
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:32,879
so especially as if once one credential

862
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,000
is exposed

863
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:39,600
and that gets reused in reality

864
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,960
once you've reset a credential that risk

865
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,439
is already mitigated

866
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,159
and the rest of it's just noise so what

867
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,080
we

868
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:47,679
essentially completely changed our model

869
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,399
so we just alert now

870
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,679
on a credential basis so once you you've

871
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:54,320
done that credential pair

872
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,360
and that's been triaged and responded to

873
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,559
that's done

874
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,399
and you can still access that

875
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:01,120
information but you don't need to go and

876
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:01,918
actually go and action it and critically

877
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,439
we've done

878
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:05,360
we've done some really cool stuff around

879
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,679
automated validation

880
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,039
so we've got three main ways of doing

881
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,039
that um

882
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,640
first you've got the credential format

883
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:15,200
so many people

884
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,919
many security teams in the organizations

885
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,159
will

886
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,960
have a password format that people must

887
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,120
adhere to

888
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,080
so in this one it's 15 characters

889
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,959
lowercase

890
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,760
numbers and uppercase characters if it

891
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,760
doesn't

892
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,879
meet those thresholds we can actually

893
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,000
automatically

894
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:34,159
reject that alert because most people

895
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,080
they actually care about is this gonna

896
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:38,799
actually enable an account takeover

897
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,279
is this legitimate access to our network

898
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,639
so

899
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:42,159
actually you can still access

900
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,440
information but in terms of what you

901
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:45,360
have to go in action it can

902
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,679
automatically be rejected

903
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,559
we can also look that up against um

904
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,279
things like

905
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,720
octa are those email addresses valid in

906
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,200
your current directory

907
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,840
so can we actually understand whether

908
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,000
live

909
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,279
that's actually something that poses a

910
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:03,120
risk to us

911
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:04,720
and finally can you actually just go and

912
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,239
we'd like to talk about these advanced

913
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,159
tools but actually

914
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:13,039
um the majority of people correlate

915
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,360
newly exposed credentials with a list

916
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,240
and

917
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:17,360
an export of their known email addresses

918
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,720
from their directory

919
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:23,678
so you can actually upload a csv

920
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:24,640
into our system and again if that

921
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:27,039
doesn't match

922
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,760
um then you can automatically invalidate

923
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,799
that

924
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:32,080
based on the the email address so often

925
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:34,240
these things that get exposed aren't

926
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,439
even valid email addresses never mind

927
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,640
passwords

928
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,559
so we're really excited about this um

929
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,840
it's gone really really well with our

930
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:45,279
client base

931
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:47,840
and so if you would like to

932
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,279
actually have a deeper understanding of

933
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,760
this or a demo

934
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,360
i can take you through it live um and

935
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,080
see how that manifests

936
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:56,559
actually would love for you to swing by

937
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,158
our

938
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:01,840
booth on level or area one

939
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:03,360
and you'll see the digital shadows logo

940
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,600
and there's uh myself

941
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,959
philip and scott who'll be there to

942
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:08,559
answer any questions and

943
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,640
probably we can probably do a bit of a

944
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:11,360
live demo of these credential alerts as

945
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,640
well

946
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:16,879
if people are interested in that

947
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:18,320
just a question on the and the general

948
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,080
chat are the slides for this

949
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,678
presentation available

950
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:25,519
absolutely um they they can be

951
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,200
i will work out the best method for

952
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,480
distributing those i understand this

953
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,080
presentation is being

954
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,640
possibly recorded and uploaded to

955
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:35,918
youtube so you could have access there

956
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,600
and but if you if you send me your email

957
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:40,080
address i'm also happy to

958
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,879
send on a copy of the slides and answer

959
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:44,320
any questions

960
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,679
that you may have so i think that's

961
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,600
that's everything that i had oh just a

962
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:49,120
few screenshots of the type of different

963
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,760
validation

964
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,320
so you can see those there so that's all

965
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:54,879
i had

966
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:56,080
um we can expand the conversation if we

967
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,000
so wish to how we

968
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,519
try and get a bit more proactive so

969
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,000
looking at whether we can pick

970
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:04,000
domains that are impersonating trying to

971
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,840
harvest credentials mobile apps

972
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,440
smooth social media try and catch shows

973
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,120
before before they target employees and

974
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,120
customers

975
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,320
so we're trying to have that proactive

976
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,760
stance so

977
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,039
if you remember back to write the

978
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,559
beginning slide where i show you all

979
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:20,320
those different things that are

980
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:22,480
exposed online if we remove those

981
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:24,559
i think we can do a really good job of

982
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:27,600
just making

983
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:29,519
making life harder for the attacker so i

984
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,959
think

985
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,200
i can't remember who it said it may have

986
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:36,080
been the asd

987
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,519
australian signals director if that's if

988
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,960
i've said that correctly

989
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,799
they had a great piece of advice which

990
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,799
just like let's just in

991
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:46,240
increase attacker costs let's not worry

992
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:49,039
about these advanced zero days and

993
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,480
espionage campaigns and apts that are

994
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:53,120
all really interesting

995
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:55,519
but if we can just get these basics done

996
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,239
the asd essentially is fantastic

997
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:00,000
let's get get the basics reduce the

998
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,720
opportunity attackers have

999
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,360
and just give ourselves a better shot so

1000
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,279
um

1001
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,918
yeah i thought i'd finish on some nice

1002
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:10,239
asd essentially material because that's

1003
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,520
uh some of the best advice out there i

1004
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,879
think

1005
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,800
and that's that's everything i had for

1006
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:16,879
today um i have left

1007
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:18,560
uh about three minutes less than i

1008
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:21,440
intended to so my apologies

1009
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,199
uh if you do have any questions really

1010
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,520
happy to answer these on any

1011
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:28,399
any topic around a counter credentials

1012
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,399
or anything else

1013
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:37,599
mfa is is indeed um

1014
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,960
is something that is awarded as the easy

1015
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:42,000
solution for everything and

1016
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:44,560
uh i appreciate it's not always

1017
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,800
as straightforward as is made out to be

1018
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,799
um

1019
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:50,639
yeah any other questions

1020
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,000
