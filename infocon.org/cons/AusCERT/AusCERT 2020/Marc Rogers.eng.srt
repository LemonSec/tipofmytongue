00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,759
mr robot he helped create hacks for the

14
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,519
show

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,800

18
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,320
lessons

19
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,360
learned from the pandemic and its impact

20
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,000
on the security

21
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,660
landscape give it up from octa for mr

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,840

[Music]

24
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,800
rogers welcome to my virtual talk

25
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,719
today i'm going to talk about lessons

26
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,919
learned from the pandemic and its impact

27
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,920
on the security landscape

28
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:00,640
so for those of you that don't know me

29
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,160
i'm mark rogers i'm the vp of cyber

30
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,840
security octa

31
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,360
and i'm one of the co-founders of the

32
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,040
cti league

33
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,280
the cti league is a non-profit

34
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,640
organization that has been working

35
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,080
throughout the pandemic

36
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,720
to protect the medical sector we work to

37
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,240
protect

38
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,360
hospitals research facilities and

39
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,960
generally any of the resources that are

40
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,479
relied on

41
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:29,360
at this critical time

42
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,520
it's a global problem and so we've built

43
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:35,039
a global team

44
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,798
our members cover more than 80 countries

45
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,960
and more than 22 different time zones

46
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,159
you can find more about us on the link

47
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,240
at the bottom

48
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,640
and we're always welcoming to new

49
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,640
members

50
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,640
the cti league is a global team for a

51
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,360
globally distributed problem

52
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,000
we see attacks coming from pretty much

53
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:00,240
every country in the world

54
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,360
more than half of the attacks against

55
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,439
healthcare

56
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,719
appear to originate from u.s and eu

57
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,758
countries

58
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,878
however we're very conscious the

59
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,239
origination

60
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:13,200
does not equal attribution many

61
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,520
campaigns

62
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,319
have highly complex infrastructure that

63
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,200
is established

64
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,839
well in advance if you look at something

65
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,640
like a disinformation campaign for

66
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,040
example you will see

67
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,399
a significant amount of infrastructure

68
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,440
that's deployed

69
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,480
in order to amplify and

70
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,720
spread content well in advance of the

71
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,440
event that they're looking to affect

72
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,200
or well in advance of the scenario that

73
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,079
they're looking to push

74
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,958
same goes for malware large c2

75
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,560
infrastructures

76
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:49,120
are often set up well in advance

77
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,000
so the bad guys have all the tools and

78
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,920
all the infrastructure

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,400
they need to be successful their

80
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,399
campaign

81
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,839
attacks against healthcare organizations

82
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,640
are a

83
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,440
global problem and we see this problem

84
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,879
coming

85
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,519
from every spectrum of attacker ranging

86
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,879
from

87
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:10,879
opportunists who are looking to exploit

88
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,640
medical facilities because they know

89
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:16,000
they're under pressure and therefore

90
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,319
more vulnerable opportunists are looking

91
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,239
to

92
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,679
make money because they know that these

93
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,680
organizations

94
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,480
while they're vulnerable are potentially

95
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,519
a cash-rich target

96
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,359
and unfortunately also we see

97
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,920
nation-state activity

98
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,640
where more sophisticated actors are

99
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,879
looking

100
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,000
to compromise places such as research

101
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,879
laboratories

102
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
to gain ip or are looking to cause

103
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,200
disruption

104
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,280
and chaos by crippling the

105
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,839
critical medical infrastructure within a

106
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,840
host country

107
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:56,159
so a breakdown of the league membership

108
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,079
we're approximately a 1500 member

109
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,000
volunteer security team

110
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,280
every single member of the cti league

111
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,400
donates their time

112
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:07,120
to the organization to help collaborate

113
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,439
on solving this global problem

114
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,159
that breaks down to about 10 percent

115
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:15,280
government and law enforcement worldwide

116
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,760
six percent from national certs seven

117
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,120
percent

118
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,120
directly from the medical and health

119
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:22,320
sector and 77

120
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,639
from infosec and with regards to infosec

121
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,960
it

122
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,880
is literally almost every discipline

123
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:29,198
from people who work in incident

124
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,000
response through to

125
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,040
individual researchers and crisis

126
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,120
managers

127
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,960
who are all pulling together to help

128
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,479
tackle this issue

129
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,120
we have more than 80 countries

130
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:44,320
represented and the team spans more than

131
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,320
22 time zones

132
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,800
so this is some of the stuff that we've

133
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,160
learned out of

134
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:57,759
our operations during the last

135
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,800
six or so months first of all

136
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:04,240
um our infrastructure and vulnerability

137
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,199
management teams have been tracking cvs

138
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,360
this year is going to break any record

139
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,479
for recorded cves

140
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:16,160
that we've seen before we're

141
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,758
already looking at around 25 000 cvs

142
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,199
recorded in the national vulnerability

143
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:22,479
database and it's

144
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,680
just september the other thing that you

145
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,719
should obviously realize

146
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,960
is that for every cve that gets reported

147
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,120
there are going to be other cves or

148
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,719
other other vulnerabilities out there

149
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:36,880
that don't get recorded so the fact that

150
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,680
we have so many people spending so much

151
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,240
time

152
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,759
to find these vulnerabilities should be

153
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,800
assumed as being

154
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:49,039
across the board both good and bad

155
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,080
time from disclosure to proof of concept

156
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,199
is now measured in

157
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,719
hours for high profile vaults some of

158
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,000
the critical volumes that were released

159
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,440
earlier this year

160
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:01,680
were literally turned into pocs within

161
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,560
a couple of hours of the disclosure

162
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,319
coming out

163
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,960
and we saw them loaded into attack

164
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,720
frameworks just a few short hours later

165
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,400
on from that

166
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,560
this is an unprecedented level of

167
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,440
accessibility to these vans

168
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,919
for people who want to use them both for

169
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,960
good

170
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,280
and unfortunately for malicious purposes

171
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,080
this means we cannot sit on any

172
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,440
vulnerability

173
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:28,560
and we must work transparently

174
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,039
and rapidly to ensure that the

175
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,880
industry is protected as fast as

176
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,120
possible

177
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,919
2020 has also seen some of the simplest

178
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,520
exploits

179
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,120
i have seen in my career we've seen this

180
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,960
things like the same directory

181
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,800
transversal methodology

182
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,000
resulting in the citrix critical

183
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,280
vulnerability

184
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,280
palo alto network's critical

185
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,479
vulnerability and f5

186
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,479
critical vulnerabilities

187
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,400
most alarmingly we've also seen that

188
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:00,400
many initial assessments

189
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,638
have been inaccurate they've either been

190
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,080
short-sighted in the sense that they

191
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,680
didn't take into account the full

192
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,800
potential impact

193
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,199
or just simply uh evolving situations

194
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,160
where the company disclosing information

195
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:16,400
didn't know what the full impact was of

196
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:20,400
the volume that they were releasing

197
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:22,960
the result was that many of these

198
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,080
assessments and releases have become

199
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,198
living events

200
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:28,479
where every day new information drops

201
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,280
about it

202
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:32,318
this causes a huge challenge because it

203
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,318
means often

204
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:40,000
the initial cvss scoring assigned

205
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:43,520
for vulnerability is not accurate

206
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,280
uh as a result it's up to organizations

207
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:47,359
like the cti league and

208
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,799
up to the certs and other organizations

209
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,840
who work on this

210
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,759
to try and tackle this problem we need

211
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,799
to help organizations understand the

212
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,479
real impact

213
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,840
and quickly jump on assessments

214
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:05,440
that are either not complete

215
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:08,159
or missing critical pieces for example

216
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,280
in some cases because of the incomplete

217
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,680
assessment

218
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:13,198
mitigation that was put out was

219
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:15,280
incomplete itself

220
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,599
and therefore not suitable to protect

221
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:20,400
organizations

222
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,400
to organizations i would say you should

223
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,799
be careful

224
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,400
certainly trust but i would make sure

225
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,599
that you verify

226
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:32,159
ensure that any uh

227
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:33,439
mitigation you put in place is quickly

228
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:36,080
tested

229
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,719
and thoroughly assessed to ensure that

230
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,120
is delivering what you need it to do

231
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:44,000
we all need to work together to try and

232
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,480
protect each other in the scenario

233
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,320
organizations large and small are

234
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,680
failing to keep up with this volume of

235
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,880
patches

236
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,920
this is another challenge which is

237
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,640
exacerbated by the fact that within

238
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,719
accurate

239
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,760
prioritizing with an accurate impact

240
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,480
assessment

241
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,600
parasite prioritization also becomes

242
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:06,480
difficult

243
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,000
and so again we need to work to help

244
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,440
organizations keep on top

245
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,399
by showing which issues are the ones

246
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,399
that are hot

247
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,880
and need to be addressed really quickly

248
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:19,519
and which issues may perhaps be

249
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,160
things that can be part for a while but

250
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,640
likewise we also need to provide support

251
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,279
with some of the smaller organizations

252
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,199
in

253
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,200
simply resourcing some of these efforts

254
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,279
the threats that we're facing throughout

255
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,800
the pandemic really do

256
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:40,320
cover a broad spectrum

257
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:43,199
we've seen sophistication

258
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,399
go from emails that literally have no

259
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,440
attachment

260
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:50,399
that simply work to try and coerce uh

261
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,440
coerce a a person into following

262
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,519
instructions

263
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,440
to get information or gain access to a

264
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:58,560
to an account

265
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:00,080
through to highly sophisticated apts

266
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:03,439
that are being sent

267
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:07,200
for specific campaigns

268
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:10,079
we see new new malware on

269
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,399
you know every few hours on busy days

270
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,880
but

271
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,839
unsurprisingly the vast majority of this

272
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,560
new malware

273
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,000
is just iterations of older malware that

274
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,359
is being rebuilt

275
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:26,160
to evade detection this is a

276
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:29,680
a shrewd economic strategy employed

277
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:32,959
by the malware authors by sending

278
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:36,399
cheap pieces of malware such as

279
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:39,518
the popular dropper ursa

280
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:41,760
um the malware authors

281
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,519
can sacrifice cheap code that can be

282
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,920
rebuilt quickly

283
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:47,680
while reducing the exposure of their

284
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,599
more sophisticated frameworks

285
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,839
to the droppers that would then pull

286
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,839
down

287
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,920
unsurprisingly also because of the

288
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:59,519
pandemic

289
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:02,640
and the desire for more information

290
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:05,040
about what's going on the

291
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:07,040
the knowledge gap that people have and

292
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:09,439
the uncertainty

293
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:11,680
fake documents are one of the largest

294
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,959
vectors that we're seeing going around

295
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:17,040
and in some cases pretty old

296
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,319
strategies are being used we're seeing

297
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,959
resurgences

298
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,240
of word macro viruses and other older

299
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,560
document formats

300
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,440
that had been going a lot quieter in the

301
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,518
past

302
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,680
or were simply being used by the the

303
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,360
least sophisticated actors

304
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,920
we're seeing these now become way more

305
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,519
popular and in some cases

306
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,839
more sophisticated in the way that

307
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:40,839
they're used as the initial

308
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,560
vector in larger more sophisticated

309
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,279
campaigns

310
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,479
it goes without saying that if you don't

311
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,680
know anything about it

312
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,680
you probably shouldn't click on it

313
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,800
likewise there is a a broad spectrum of

314
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,319
goals here

315
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:01,439
individual employees are directly under

316
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,720
attack

317
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,200
the goals are account and identity theft

318
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,880
but also internal tool compromise

319
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,079
because attackers have realized

320
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,800
that they can pivot across often flat

321
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,439
networks within healthcare organizations

322
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,880
by gaining access from one tool and

323
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,639
pivot across others

324
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,320
and as we saw recently within the

325
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:25,120
twitter attack

326
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,600
this this kind of pivoting is even is

327
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,440
even

328
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,720
successful against some of the more

329
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:32,560
sophisticated enterprises

330
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:34,480
naturally infrastructure is also under

331
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:36,079
attack we see a wide use of

332
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,120
infrastructure farms against

333
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:41,199
medical facilities and we

334
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,519
as an organization identify and work to

335
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,360
close a huge number of old

336
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,360
known vulnerabilities every day

337
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:54,800
the attackers themselves are after data

338
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:58,320
ip and obviously access

339
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:01,120
we routinely find stolen data for sale

340
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,160
on the dark web and likewise we

341
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,519
routinely see

342
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,160
stolen accounts being sold and these

343
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,800
accounts

344
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,079
often also then get used to enrich other

345
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,120
forms of attack

346
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,359
such as business email compromise

347
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,680
and something that's growing in

348
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:21,040
popularity is we're seeing access

349
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:24,000
to compromised companies being sold for

350
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,639
price points like one bitcoin to gain

351
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,040
access to a company

352
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,240
attackers will also often work the chain

353
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,800
of trust

354
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,720
attacking smaller organizations so that

355
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,279
they can get into the larger

356
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,440
more well-defended ones this means those

357
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:41,839
of us in larger organizations

358
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,360
need to pay a special attention to our

359
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,399
smaller suppliers

360
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,120
and support them during this time but

361
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,600
also

362
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,360
where smaller organizations make up

363
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,680
significant amounts of

364
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,360
our key infrastructure for example in

365
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:58,000
the united states

366
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:59,120
close to 70 percent of medical support

367
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,560
is provided

368
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:06,079
by smaller healthcare organizations

369
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:09,040
we need to protect them because

370
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,560
losing these smaller more vulnerable

371
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:14,160
organizations

372
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,160
will be a critical problem for us

373
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:18,399
the simplest tax attacks are proving to

374
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,760
be

375
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:25,120
the most effective isolation

376
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:26,240
created by teleworking has eroded the

377
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,680
herd immunity

378
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,000
that we normally get um from being in a

379
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:33,839
large

380
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,839
company the ability to go and seek

381
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,600
help from your i.t department or

382
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,880
security department

383
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:42,959
is a resource that many of us have used

384
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,800
as a defense mechanism you click on

385
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:47,199
something unintended

386
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,160
or you see something strange on your

387
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,800
laptop

388
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:52,000
you know often your security or it

389
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,279
departments are the first place you're

390
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,079
going to turn

391
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,360
when you're alone and working remotely

392
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,760
it's much harder

393
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,399
to seek uh support this way and the

394
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,519
attackers

395
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:06,000
know this and they're leveraging these

396
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,760
human targeted attacks because they know

397
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,160
they're going to be more successful

398
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,800
as a result there are several major

399
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,680
wishing

400
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,399
voicemail fishing and fishing campaigns

401
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,719
ongoing right now

402
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:20,480
and while the vector itself is

403
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,720
relatively simple

404
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:25,519
we're seeing these attackers use highly

405
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,360
sophisticated execution for them

406
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,880
we see them carry out open source

407
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,600
intelligence techniques

408
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:33,040
to gather information on the employees

409
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,959
on the processes

410
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:38,959
and on the assets for target companies

411
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,279
they then leverage this information to

412
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:44,319
build detail-oriented infrastructure

413
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:46,480
like landing pages fake documents

414
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,240
or to follow the processes that an

415
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,240
organization would expect

416
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:53,279
and we see them perform repeat

417
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,240
engagements where they'll try one tactic

418
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:57,600
and then maybe pivot to another tactic

419
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,720
with a different attempt

420
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:04,000
if it's unsuccessful learning each time

421
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:06,000
and improving their approach each time

422
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,040
there are thriving economies now based

423
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,680
around these

424
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,519
compromised account sales and we see the

425
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:14,880
accounts sold their forums

426
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:17,040
on dark websites and in the case of

427
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,040
the highly publicized twitter attack

428
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,240
they were being sold on discord

429
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:26,160
forums and other highly visible

430
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:28,399
sites unsurprisingly

431
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,519
this is also a significant component of

432
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,399
the

433
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,120
explosively growing business email

434
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,360
compromise

435
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,639
economy which is probably one of the

436
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,360
most significant

437
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,759
financial threats facing organizations

438
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,759
today

439
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:48,800
so what do we recommend

440
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:50,479
well we all need to work together to

441
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:54,000
tackle this global issue

442
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:55,680
and it is truly a global issue

443
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,560
the silos that we normally find

444
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:00,560
ourselves in are a significant challenge

445
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,719
normally these silos aren't intended to

446
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:05,198
be problematic

447
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,319
but they become problematic when

448
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:07,839
companies don't share

449
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,799
information back and forth because it's

450
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,720
seen as uh protected internal ip

451
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:13,839
when countries don't share information

452
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,760
back and forth

453
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,079
because either they don't want to give

454
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:20,400
an advantage or because

455
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,839
the policy creates too much red tape for

456
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:25,039
them to get around

457
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:27,438
attackers profit the cti league

458
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,319
has shown that it is possible for us to

459
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,320
work

460
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,440
within the bounds of our normal

461
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,639
restrictions

462
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:37,679
without violating corporate

463
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:39,520
policies and without violating national

464
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:43,039
legislation or policy

465
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,000
we can still collaborate and we can come

466
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,000
together

467
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,679
and create an army that will tackle this

468
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
problem

469
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,520
we've also seen that companies which had

470
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,919
limited pandemic plans

471
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:55,039
have had have ended up with significant

472
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,440
technical debt

473
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,160
in their teleworking strategies many of

474
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,720
them have

475
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,320
had to urgently move towards byod

476
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,720
strategies

477
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,678
this has left them in a poor position

478
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:08,960
from a security

479
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:10,559
and defense perspective likewise

480
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,720
some companies have been forced to punch

481
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,799
holes in traditionally strong

482
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,000
security architectures in order to

483
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:20,559
enable some of this teleworking

484
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
we are going to have to assess what this

485
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,480
new normal looks like

486
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,840
and adapt our risk assessment strategies

487
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,520
to compensate

488
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:29,039
to make sure that we are really

489
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,520
understanding the problems

490
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,400
and that this technical debt itself

491
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:36,639
doesn't become the new normal

492
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,080
we need to look at how we adapt

493
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:41,600
awareness training

494
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,120
in this new normal for teleworking

495
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,639
humans are going to continue to be a

496
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,559
target

497
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,240
current approaches are clearly not

498
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,918
working well

499
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:54,799
and we need to adapt and improve

500
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,640
you should owe incent yourself i.e use

501
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,039
open source intelligence tools

502
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:00,400
against yourself and your company see

503
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:03,520
what's out there

504
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,840
what surface can attackers use to cause

505
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:08,480
problems

506
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,280
finally large organizations need to

507
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,679
prioritize

508
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,280
infrastructure patches and perform their

509
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,559
own risk assessments

510
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:20,720
rather than rely on initial cvss

511
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:23,760
scoring that may not fully cover

512
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,240
information and which may also

513
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,879
not take into account rather which

514
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,520
definitely

515
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,720
will not take into account contextual

516
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,520
information

517
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,600
one man's cvss five might be another

518
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,840
man's cvs s7

519
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,600
perform your own risk assessments using

520
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:43,840
the knowledge that you have

521
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:46,879
about how these issues may impact you

522
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,760
and lastly we need to find a way to help

523
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,400
smaller

524
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:52,879
smaller organizations patch the issues

525
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,760
that they have

526
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,200
these organizations often outsource all

527
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,400
of their security

528
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,000
or it services

529
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,080
as a result they don't have the

530
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,600
resources to apply these patches or

531
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,280
perform the assessments

532
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,918
and so we need to find better ways to

533
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,840
communicate to these organizations

534
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,360
and better ways to support them to

535
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,439
ensure that they're protected

536
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,039
because as we've seen with chain of

537
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,600
trust exploitation

538
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,720
often these smaller organizations are

539
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:24,240
the ways in

540
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,240
to our bigger organizations

541
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,479
