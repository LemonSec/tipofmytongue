00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,399
okay

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:09,360
now in closing we've spoken a lot about

3
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:10,000
threats this afternoon so we're going to

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,200
finish

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,320
with a triple threat

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:18,160
a tremendous trio of tech

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,000
titans one of our speakers leads the

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,760
digital forensics and incidence response

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,680
practice at cyberx it was previously

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,680
with the australian federal police

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,960
working on international police

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,840
investigations

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,880
and intelligence operations including

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,760
traditional crimes facilitated by new

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,920
technologies joining him is a renowned

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,040
digital forensics researcher and senior

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,680
software engineer

20
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,519
the leading digital paleontologist of

21
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,519
the velociraptor project

22
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,960
providing digital forensic investigators

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,600
and incident responders with the next

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,960
generation

25
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,680
tool set for endpoint visibility and

26
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,520
analysis and rounding out the group is a

27
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:00,239
senior investigator in the cybrex

28
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,760
dfir team who was closely involved

29
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,919
in some of the major attacks against

30
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,879
australia during 2020 now i presume when

31
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,040
he says he was

32
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,000
closely involved he means in a good way

33
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,520
but we'll find out

34
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,360
anyway he's currently the leader of the

35
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:16,560

us do

65
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,319
uh this session this afternoon it's

66
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,920
going to be fairly brief

67
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,920
uh my name is nick klein i look after

68
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,440
the digital forensics and ir

69
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,920
team at cybercx um now cybersee actually

70
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,680
you've

71
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,359
probably heard of we're a pretty proud

72
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,160
australian new zealand company

73
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,080
and one of the core parts of our mission

74
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,440
is to protect the communities that we

75
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,200
live in

76
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,040
as you all know australia's been hit

77
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,839
with or experiencing a significant

78
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,760
increase

79
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,360
in cyber incidents during 2020

80
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,079
particularly in the earlier months of

81
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,920
the year

82
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,000
and it targeted all levels of government

83
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,359
and across a wide range of industry

84
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,720
sectors as well

85
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,560
no doubt many people here would have

86
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,400
seen the prime minister's uh

87
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,599
very public announcement on this back in

88
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,280
june

89
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,640
so with that in mind i'm really pleased

90
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,800
to be here today because we're going to

91
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,958
announce the release of a new tool

92
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,720
that we've developed to help respond to

93
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,760
this threat which we've called

94
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,239
cyber cx digger and i'm also very

95
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,200
pleased to be here by my colleague jay

96
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,680
from the dfir team at cyber cx who's

97
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,839
been the

98
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,080
the leader of the digger project for us

99
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,920
and an old friend old colleague and one

100
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,159
of the industry's leading developers of

101
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,238
open source dfir tools

102
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,679
mike cohen for anyone who's used tools

103
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,720
like volatility

104
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,000
or recall or ger as we have

105
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,560
then you've benefited from mike's

106
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,360
research and development

107
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,640
so uh most recently as as many of you

108
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,760
know mike's been working on a tool

109
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,760
called velociraptor

110
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,599
for a few years now and it's a really

111
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,879
powerful capability for distributed

112
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,399
endpoint analysis

113
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,560
and for evidence collection and for

114
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,200
response and our dfir team has been

115
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,120
using this

116
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,280
and supporting it since it's very early

117
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,840
days we're very proud to say

118
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:54,080
um and velociraptor is the platform on

119
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,920
which cyber cx digger is based

120
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,519
so i'm going to throw over to mike and

121
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,720
ask mike if you could just

122
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,720
give us a little bit of info on

123
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,000
velociraptor in particular the the

124
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,439
functionality that's

125
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,200
that you've built which is reasonably

126
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,239
new to help make uh

127
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,200
digger possible uh thanks nick um so

128
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,760
velociraptor

129
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,480
uh is really the the cool thing about it

130
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:15,439
is that it

131
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,079
actually has a query language and that

132
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,358
allows

133
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,840
you to write uh queries that uh kind of

134
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,599
uh

135
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,280
check up the state of the machine

136
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,840
and you can do all kinds of forensic

137
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,638
analysis using those queries

138
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,359
the search and detection and and just

139
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,520
look for

140
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,440
specific things and allows you to be

141
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,120
very targeted with these queries

142
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,639
so really velociraptor is really all

143
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,759
about just being

144
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,520
a query ender just like asking

145
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,120
your endpoint as if it was a database

146
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,680
just querying it

147
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,360
and then basically just extracting uh

148
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,160
specifically the information that you're

149
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,400
after

150
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,320
and this capability seems to work really

151
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,198
well with the use case of

152
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,400
the digger because you know it basically

153
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,720
allows you to

154
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,679
uh write very very specific custom

155
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:05,280
checks

156
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:08,080
um for um for specific things

157
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,638
um which which is basically what uh you

158
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,840
know

159
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:15,039
what the digger is all about

160
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,039
cool awesome thanks mike so

161
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,039
before we go on to how it works uh just

162
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,479
a bit about why we decided to build this

163
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:22,080
and to make it available

164
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,680
um the threat actors that i mentioned

165
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,280
before that are responsible for

166
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,360
some of these attacks against australia

167
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,320
they're known to combine some basic

168
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,000
attack techniques

169
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,320
and also some more sophisticated

170
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,600
elements uh and some of those can be

171
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,000
quite difficult to

172
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,680
detect and with traditional tools as

173
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,840
well they're also known to leave

174
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,639
implants on compromised networks

175
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,000
which will help them gain re-entry later

176
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,400
on if they want to

177
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,400
so cyber cx has worked with a lot of our

178
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,120
clients to detect and respond to these

179
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,320
breaches

180
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,840
and in collaboration with some

181
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,199
government agencies and also some

182
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,799
industry partners

183
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,960
and through this work we've developed

184
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,720
some very specific threat intelligence

185
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,239
about the attackers that can very

186
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,120
quickly and effectively

187
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,080
detect their evidence of them on

188
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,400
networks

189
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,199
so cyber cx digger leverages that threat

190
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,198
intel

191
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,440
and provides very simple to use tool so

192
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,880
that you can download it scan it and you

193
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,840
can see if there's any evidence of those

194
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,719
thread actors

195
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,080
on your systems so i'll pass over to j

196
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,960
now and he's going to give us a bit more

197
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,639
details about

198
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:26,080
how it works yep thanks nick

199
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,039
um so at the moment we've got an initial

200
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,919
windows release

201
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,280
and that parses and scans several types

202
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,198
of windows artifacts looking for

203
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,119
malicious activities

204
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,440
at the moment this includes iis web

205
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,759
server logs windows scheduled tasks

206
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,199
a range of different web shells windows

207
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,840
service manipulations

208
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,039
and several program execution artifacts

209
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,758
including user assist

210
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,840
prefetch jim cash the trump database and

211
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,720
the windows 10 timeline

212
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,599
um so here in particular you can see uh

213
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,880
that's our github page

214
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:01,680
and that's where you can pull down the

215
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,319
executable from the repo from our ccx

216
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,199
labs

217
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:06,639
get upside and so at the moment we've

218
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:07,360
just got our windows executable and a

219
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,400
linux one

220
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,479
should be coming soon so we just move to

221
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,520
the download page

222
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:18,080
and to usage so um

223
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,840
so at the moment uh all you have to do

224
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,880
to run it is open a command prompt or a

225
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,280
powershell prompt

226
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,520
um and remember to run this as admin and

227
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,520
you just run the executable from there

228
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,719
it is important to run this as admin so

229
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,159
that the artifacts can

230
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,759
access some of the data sources which

231
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,400
are normally locked

232
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,759
so just remember to to run that as admin

233
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,560
um

234
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:40,560
the scan can take about a minute or so

235
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,199
it can sometimes take longer on a file

236
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,919
server or

237
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,520
similarly large systems if it has to

238
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:47,280
pull a lot of files down

239
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,639
but when it's done it'll generate an

240
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,239
html report

241
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,800
which will be created in the same folder

242
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,919
along with a zip file for more granular

243
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,680
detections

244
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:59,198
and to view it you just simply open that

245
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:02,319
html report and review those results

246
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,240
so looking at that html report it

247
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,360
provides a summary of the areas that

248
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,520
were scanned and

249
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,840
and the results that were found some of

250
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,520
our detections look for specific iocs

251
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,000
while others especially our program

252
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,120
execution

253
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,960
information produces information that

254
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,879
does need to be reviewed manually by the

255
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,638
user or the admin and compared against

256
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,319
normal system usage

257
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,080
however in particular we provide

258
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,599
guidance on what to look here

259
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,318
look for here and that's provided

260
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,440
through our wiki on our github page

261
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,120
um so looking at these findings uh

262
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,559
hopefully you know number one you won't

263
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,200
have any findings

264
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:38,319
but if there are the report provides

265
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,959
more information on

266
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,560
the interpretation of the meaning and in

267
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:44,479
our wiki page we also provide

268
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:46,800
recommended next steps to investigate

269
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,560
on a per artifact and per finding basis

270
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,760
and we hope to continuously update this

271
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,319
as we learn more about

272
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:53,439
these types of attacks it is important

273
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,880
to note as well that

274
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,800
finding in the report does not

275
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,000
necessarily mean the system has been

276
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,079
compromised

277
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,279
and further investigation should also be

278
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,800
performed

279
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,560
so that you can understand the context

280
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,319
of any findings to determine

281
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,040
whether they are indeed malicious or if

282
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,440
they are just false positives

283
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,880
um so there's two ways that you can

284
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,160
really run this tool and

285
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:18,640
i'll let mike explain now

286
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,680
thanks jay so as you've seen you can run

287
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,519
it uh

288
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:25,760
interactively on a machine by itself

289
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,760
but that doesn't really scale to many

290
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,480
many machines and most organizations

291
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,760
have a big number of machines that they

292
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,360
might need to scan

293
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,519
if you've already got velociraptor

294
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,839
deployed velociraptor

295
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,720
is a client server top architecture

296
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,440
where you can

297
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:42,959
uh you can essentially do a hunt um and

298
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,800
so you can actually just download

299
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,839
exactly those uh same uh

300
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,079
queries that uh cyber cx have developed

301
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:52,000
as part of the bigger project

302
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,160
and then just add them to your standard

303
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,480
velociraptor deployment

304
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,360
and then just do a hunt across your

305
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,200
entire network

306
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,800
and then you know within within a few

307
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,959
minutes you can find out

308
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,079
if there are any hits for those

309
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,839
indicators across

310
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:11,359
the deployment yep

311
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,760
thanks mike sir um on to the purpose and

312
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,240
uh

313
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,760
limitations of the tools so now while

314
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,680
digger is very effective

315
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,040
at detecting specific threat actor

316
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,719
activity it's also

317
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:22,399
important to understand what it doesn't

318
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,200
do so it is

319
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,360
not an av an antivirus it will not block

320
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,200
anything malicious that it does find

321
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,959
but it will clearly show it to you so

322
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,200
that you can remove it after confirming

323
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,800
yourself if it is malicious

324
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,880
it's also not intended to find all

325
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,640
traces of threat actor activity

326
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,160
but we do want to build on this further

327
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,160
with your help

328
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,480
so it is actually also a

329
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:47,120
community-focused project

330
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:49,040
so digger is a free and open source

331
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,880
software it doesn't require any

332
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,319
registration we don't ask for your email

333
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,200
address we don't track visits to the

334
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,279
website

335
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:58,320
and it doesn't call home in any way and

336
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,399
your results aren't shared with cyber cx

337
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,320
we have tested it to ensure that this is

338
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,839
the case um but just be aware you know

339
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:06,640
this is a new binary release

340
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,519
and it is uh just newly signed so it is

341
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,600
initially

342
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,200
possibly going to detect trips and

343
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,279
detection mechanisms

344
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,560
and uh if you have mounted a cloud drive

345
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,720
to your system

346
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:18,160
it will also try and scan this and it

347
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,200
may result in an alert for cloud

348
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,880
downloads

349
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,480
but we have gone through and tested to

350
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,519
make sure it's not trying to

351
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,519
call out or have any

352
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,680
additional network activity that isn't

353
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,480
required

354
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,279
if you do find something from running

355
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,839
this tool

356
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,839
in the reports we have also provided

357
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,240
recommended next steps to investigate it

358
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,560
further in our wiki page on our github

359
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,560
and our intention here is to empower you

360
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:46,880
the users and the admins to detect and

361
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,040
validate these findings yourselves

362
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,480
you don't have to contact us but if you

363
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,680
are concerned that you may have been

364
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,639
compromised

365
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,399
we are of course happy to help because

366
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,760
this is a community focused project

367
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,519
we also welcome and encourage

368
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,399
contributions from the community

369
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:04,480
so if you find evidence of it um if you

370
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,399
can share specific details with us

371
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,000
uh we can identify any strong threat

372
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,360
intelligence from that and include that

373
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,360
into future releases

374
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,959
so your contribution does actively help

375
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,120
to protect others

376
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,959
and we also welcome feedback and any

377
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:19,040
other things that you might have

378
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,040
uh which you can send to us at digger

379
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:24,560
scythe cx.com.edu

380
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,880
which is on our github page as well

381
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,319
cool thanks joey so as jay was saying uh

382
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,000
and as i said at the start part of the

383
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,680
mission of cybercx is

384
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,920
protecting the communities that we live

385
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,000
in um one of the reasons

386
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,519
we think that these uh threat actors

387
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,160
have been successful in these attacks

388
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,839
against

389
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,199
australian organizations is frankly

390
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:44,079
because we haven't driven

391
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,600
cost into their operations enough and we

392
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,040
hope that by releasing digger this will

393
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,959
actually help to expose

394
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,480
some of their capabilities and some of

395
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,160
their tooling and increase

396
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,680
their operational costs now it's not

397
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,360
going to stop the attacks but

398
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,800
it should make them a little harder to

399
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,440
carry out

400
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,199
so ccx dig is now launched on the public

401
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,279
github page which you can see

402
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,880
on the slide there and as we said the

403
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,079
wiki also provides more information

404
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,320
about the project

405
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,199
and how the detections work and also how

406
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,839
to interpret

407
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,320
any scanning results you've got so

408
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,279
please

409
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,800
use it download it share it definitely

410
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,639
contribute to it if you have some threat

411
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,199
intel that you'd like to contribute back

412
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:22,480
