your way of addressing the threat

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:45,840
landscaping in a positive

14
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,840
positive fashion

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,319
hey just a quick disclaimer before we

um i'm not i'm not talking on behalf of

18
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,719
anyone here

observing the world out there and also

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,920
i'm not judging any

24
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:11,039
activity in neither the aviation

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,560
industry or or the climate movement

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,439
i'm just analyzing this scenario as a

27
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:26,320
a threat landscape scenario for for the

28
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:29,359
aviation in current times

29
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,639
um first agenda so the agenda

30
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,560
i'm gonna introduce myself and i'm gonna

31
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,400
start with the conclusion conclusion

32
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,640
there's a button

33
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:39,439
uh bottom line up front i'm gonna tell

34
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,960
you

35
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,199
what the takeaways from this

36
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:45,119
presentation are and then i'm going to

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,119
introduce you my hypothesis that is the

38
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,840
title of this presentation the

39
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,640
climate motivated cyber attacks or

40
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,479
activism

41
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,600
against aviation i'm going to discuss

42
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,840
several different subjects with you um

43
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,119
like perception of an enemy political

44
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,640
motivator uh

45
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:06,840
agents uh hacktivism and the times it

46
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,000
interfaced with climate movement

47
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,720
um the cyberspace and

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,080
the evolution of activities to the

49
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,959
cyberspace

50
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,879
um the future of terrorism the expected

51
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:21,440
new waves for terrorism

52
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,280
the timeline for for a climate movement

53
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,480
past present and future

54
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,599
uh aviation the history of aviation

55
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,040
under attack

56
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:33,130
how covet impacted aviation how covete

57
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,120
impacted other industries

58
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:37,599
[Music]

59
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:39,040
uh there will be uh some information

60
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,359
specific between the

61
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,079
the relationship between aviation and

62
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,120
and

63
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,760
modern climate movements and um i'm

64
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,160
gonna

65
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,959
cover the escalation of conflict the

66
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,799
conflict and

67
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,720
uh and then we're going to go over a

68
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,239
notice of computing hypothesis there is

69
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,440
an intelligence uh

70
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:01,200
um analytical tool that i'm

71
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:04,800
just gonna use there to uh to

72
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:08,159
uh and use evidences to to confirm

73
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:18,319
my argument that there's a climate

74
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:23,120
inspired cyber attack against aviation

75
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:27,040
so myself um my formal education i'm

76
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:30,239
a information system a specialist and a

77
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,959
a computer engineer and then i have a

78
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,640
few

79
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:37,680

security

88
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,840
uh looking at policy and intelligence

89
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,560
and counterterrorism

90
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:04,959

chief of information security officer

113
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,680

114
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,800
project

115
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,840

navy

118
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,400
so the bottom line up front so what are

119
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,720
the takeaways for

120
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,000
for this presentation what we're going

121
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,039
to conclude

122
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,600
and i like to bring it in advance not at

123
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:29,440
the end

124
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,440
first of all when you're working with

125
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,919
cyber security information security and

126
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:35,600
you

127
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:37,758
you start assessing the threat landscape

128
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,320
understanding who you are who is the

129
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,039
opponent and what are the risks

130
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,639
that you're going to be facing um

131
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,360
depending on the

132
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,039
the industry you are in uh your

133
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,080
situation is going to be different from

134
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,000
the others so there's no

135
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:55,198
one-size-fits-all solution

136
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,080
and you should never compare your

137
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,759
um your threat landscape you should

138
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,039
never have a

139
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:07,199
risk management approach that is not

140
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:11,440
compatible to the level of sensitivity

141
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:15,280
and criticality that your business

142
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,280
that your business is involved with

143
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:22,560
and your organization any organization

144
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,759
in terms of internet and everything

145
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,080
online and a

146
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,840
cyber version of everything you're not

147
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,120
an island you're not isolated from the

148
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,198
world so

149
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,319
when you go and you put together your

150
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,240
information

151
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,080
security management systems and you

152
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,280
consider external factors you should

153
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,080
also consider

154
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,679
uh political and ideological factors

155
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,919
because they will help

156
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,919
you shape your threat landscape

157
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,318
and then this uh third one about the

158
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,400
perception

159
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,599
uh public perception how you are

160
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,520
perceived

161
00:06:53,599 --> 00:07:00,560
uh by a a sector of society or

162
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:04,240
a group or several groups within society

163
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:06,319
that they might be gaining momentum

164
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,360
right now in growing in sympathy and

165
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,800
support

166
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:13,520
um how modern um

167
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,080
in political and ideological movements

168
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:17,680
see

169
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:21,120
sees you and um and that

170
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:24,000
that this understanding of how people uh

171
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,000
perceive your organization will inform

172
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,840
uh who your track actors are

173
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,599
like if you're going to have a library

174
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,198
or a register of trent

175
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:35,360
agents the way the world perceive your

176
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:38,479
organization and your activity

177
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,479
is is relevant

178
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,080
and then when you're doing this study

179
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:47,280
researching and trying to understand

180
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,000
how what is your image out there and if

181
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,638
you understand this uh

182
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,400
people see you as as a huge threat they

183
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,520
perceive you as a threat

184
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:00,799
to the whole planet or to mankind so

185
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,719
this is the time when a minimal viable

186
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,639
security doesn't work for you

187
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,160
you're gonna need a to bring the

188
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,479
security bar up

189
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,160
um because you're gonna be facing

190
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,440
continuous and persistent

191
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:16,000
um attacks from from

192
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,120
from groups that see you as a real

193
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,120
threat to the world

194
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,479
and and the fifth uh

195
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,120
outcome of these studies is this all

196
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:33,120
conflicts they migrate to cyberspace

197
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:36,240
so if in the past your industry was uh

198
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:39,679
faced with threats and risks related to

199
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:43,440
a certain type of movement um

200
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,079
chances are now that the revival of that

201
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,640
movement

202
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,760
or other branches of that movement will

203
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:55,839
come after you

204
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:55,839
use leveraging the cyberspace for that

205
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:05,519
so what is the the hypothesis that i'm

206
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,160
um defending with this presentation here

207
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:10,560
what am i

208
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:14,319
arguing um i'm arguing that

209
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:19,279
for the past years the recent years from

210
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:21,600
the many cyber attacks that um

211
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,720
hit aviation some of them are actually

212
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,000
the product of a

213
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,399
climate uh inspired activism

214
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,839
and i'm gonna so i'm also arguing that

215
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,760
um

216
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,920
you're gonna become a target not

217
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:35,680
exclusively based on what you have

218
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,959
not always people we want one you have

219
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,000
but some people

220
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:43,599
um the way they perceive you will turn

221
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,600
you into a target as well

222
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:51,200
and finally is that um

223
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:53,120
about the cyberspace your opponents will

224
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,279
leverage the cyberspace

225
00:09:53,120 --> 00:10:00,160
and in in especially for this

226
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,839
study the climate new climate movements

227
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,480
they will leverage the cyber

228
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,519
space to attack the perceived enemies

229
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,600
everyone is

230
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,200
everyone else is doing this and that

231
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,440
they wouldn't stay out of this

232
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,680
possibility

233
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,959
uh talking about perception and perceive

234
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,359
the enemies like

235
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:18,560
um it's important you understand

236
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,200
yourself

237
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,800
going back in time to the art of war

238
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,640
like understand yourself

239
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,240
and understand the opponent and

240
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,000
understand the battlefield

241
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,000
and when you understand yourself it's

242
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,920
important you define your most critical

243
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,880
assets and you protect your assets

244
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,839
because

245
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,240
indeed uh some threat agents they will

246
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,040
what

247
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,279
what you have then we want to monetize

248
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,439
from what you have they will exfiltrate

249
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,120
and distribute what you have and so you

250
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:50,160
you might get fined um some

251
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,079
potentially a malicious insider

252
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,560
nowadays like we get lots of people

253
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,640
making being made redundant

254
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,000
um they might feel got a sense of

255
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,680
injustice and they just

256
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,959
they might just want revenge and

257
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,000
and they will try to prevent you from

258
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,880
operating

259
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
and then all independent independently

260
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:13,279
of your industry

261
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,720
all those well-known uh trent

262
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,640
agents actors hackers and militias

263
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,440
inside the

264
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:24,720
state-sponsored agents

265
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,079
in the organized crime you should have

266
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:29,200
all those

267
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:32,719
agents on your your risk register

268
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:37,200
your your threat actors uh

269
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:41,040
library but you should consider

270
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,600
of buying during uh for present days

271
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,480
you should consider it's important that

272
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,399
you don't miss

273
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,800
on this one it's like people that are

274
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,680
out there that perceive you as a threat

275
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,880
as well

276
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,920
because those will have the highest the

277
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:58,000
strongest

278
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:00,399
uh mo um legitimating factor

279
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,440
they have a real reason like inside

280
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:03,920
their minds

281
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,680
among themselves and with the message

282
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,399
and propaganda they're sending to the

283
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,920
world

284
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:10,720
they believe they have a a very strong

285
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,439
reason

286
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,399
um that they should attack you and

287
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,600
disrupt your

288
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:18,000
operations and and if possible remove

289
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,360
you

290
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,839
completely from from the market

291
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,839
from the from the world scenario

292
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,800
so we always discuss when talking to

293
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,040
clients oh it's not a matter of

294
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,319
if it's a matter of when everyone is

295
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,360
going to get hacked

296
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:41,440
but then now when

297
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,959
we think about the motivation what is

298
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,560
leading um

299
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:49,040
people in different groups or um

300
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,319
criminal organizations you hack here

301
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,279
it's more a matter of

302
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,320
how frequent and how how bad and how

303
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,959
targeted

304
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,480
because if money is the motivation then

305
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:01,439
you just know the target

306
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,320
and uh eventually yes a matter of when

307
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,800
they will

308
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,240
hit you but it's going to be in a more

309
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,279
diffuse way

310
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,240
a more random way everyone is going to

311
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,240
get hacked

312
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,279
and you still need security controls in

313
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,399
place you still need

314
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:18,880
your resources your staff

315
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,680
but when the motivation is about

316
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,000
perception

317
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,519
and you are perceived again of i'm

318
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,480
repeating myself

319
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,519
if you are perceived as a the great evil

320
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,880
a target

321
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,680
a target that is um justifiable because

322
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,000
you

323
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:38,560
you putting the world

324
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,079
towards an end so they will come to you

325
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:43,518
in a targeted and

326
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:47,599
coordinated and persistent way and

327
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:51,040
here's when your security posture

328
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,920
security culture and your level

329
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,240
of protections need to be superior to

330
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,079
the

331
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:58,639
the other industries that do not

332
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:01,680
represent the same threat for

333
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,680
some groups out there

334
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,760
and then i'm talking about the climate

335
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,760
movement and i'm

336
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,000
talking about specific groups that might

337
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,480
want to hack your specific

338
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,120
industry i would like to to go for some

339
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,000
definite

340
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:19,040
definitions and similarities be between

341
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,839
them and the times they've interfaced

342
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,599
so starting with terrorism thus last

343
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,199
time i checked there was 52 different

344
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,920
definitions out there

345
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:30,560
but um all of them have something in

346
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:32,000
common like is it an act of violence or

347
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,399
threat

348
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:37,120
of violence against the perceived enemy

349
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:40,720
there can be people or property

350
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:43,839
and they want to spread fear

351
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,639
for political and ideological religious

352
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,279
reason

353
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:48,480
and and they they have this sense of

354
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,000
it's a

355
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,720
they have of oppression and um

356
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,320
and they they've been oppressed or they

357
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,959
part of a holy war

358
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:01,279
or they have this nationalistic feeling

359
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:04,880
that is the legitimating factor

360
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:07,839
behind all this all their activities

361
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:09,920
and um you look at terrorism and and

362
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:12,480
then when you look at activism and

363
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,479
the new climate movement and hacktivism

364
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:16,560
they have one thing in common

365
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,000
there is the motivation all of them are

366
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,479
motivated by

367
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,519
a political ideological and sometimes

368
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,240
religious

369
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:27,279
reason and you're going to see that they

370
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:30,800
start interfacing um

371
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,600
between each other and also in some of

372
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,399
those groups

373
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,519
as they change the approach and tactics

374
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,880
and techniques they

375
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:42,959
actually evolve from a

376
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:47,040
non-violent um activist group to a

377
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:52,160
a proper um typified in-law

378
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:55,279
terrorist organization and we've seen

379
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:58,959
this interaction happening uh between

380
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:02,560
uh hacktivism and uh activism

381
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:05,439
uh in the past uh few years and it's

382
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,000
it's the thing with uh inspiring um

383
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,759
cyber attack and inspiring terrorism

384
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,160
you actually don't need to go and ask

385
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,720
for help but because you share you have

386
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,759
common

387
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:19,279
uh motivations and you

388
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:22,240
you have sympathy for the same things um

389
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,680
and then you end up getting the help of

390
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,759
some

391
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,000
a threat agent that has the means and

392
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:32,160
the tools to perform what you

393
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,160
you couldn't otherwise do by yourself

394
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,759
so here we have two cases we have the

395
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:41,199
case of uh

396
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:43,040
tata zero deco sidio that they were not

397
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,839
like with the government the solution

398
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,959
for

399
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,600
for the climate crisis and no

400
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,959
climate group no ecological um

401
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,920
protesters

402
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,560
uh went and asked for their help they

403
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,560
yeah they

404
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,399
they are actually part of the earth's

405
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,920
first movement but they went again

406
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,399
and hacked the website by them

407
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,599
themselves and the same thing with a

408
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:08,720
anonymous in 2015

409
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:12,319
anonymous wasn't happy with the u.n

410
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,880
uh with them during that u.n

411
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,918
summit some uh climate protesters

412
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,000
arrested

413
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,120
and they did they didn't think it was

414
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,119
fair so they went there

415
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,198
and hacked all the officials credentials

416
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:26,879
and exfiltrated the data and

417
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:30,480
and and distribute the data um online

418
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:34,240
and um those are just two times that we

419
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:37,520
we saw uh activists interfacing with uh

420
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:39,679
with uh with the climate movement

421
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,918
and they felt inspired to do and they

422
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:43,760
had the means

423
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,440
so i want to cover with you the

424
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:49,200
cyberspace and

425
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:51,760
how in present days every activity

426
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,880
being a criminal activity or defense and

427
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,559
policy

428
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,720
activity they have migrated to the

429
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,918
cyberspace there's a version

430
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,320
a cyber version of about everything and

431
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,000
with

432
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:07,439
activism they might go cyber

433
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,640
virtual themselves or they might

434
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:11,120
just interface with a a group that is

435
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,200
already

436
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,159
cyber that operates in the cyberspace

437
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,799
and shares the

438
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,799
in shared the same motivations

439
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,039
no one will escape operation

in the cyberspace

442
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,760
it's okay i'm i'm talking about eco

443
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,160
terrorism and

444
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,000
and chances of a client the climate

445
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:37,360
movement escalates to

446
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,799
to ecoterrorism and um and this is

447
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:43,280
this interface with activism so

448
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:45,600
what i'm talking about it and just not

449
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,080
just making up things from my mind

450
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,199
um when you go and study the future of

451
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,559
terrorism

452
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,559
you have ways of approaching

453
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,639
you haven't seen the future so it's a

454
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,320
bit complicated but you go and look at

455
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,679
the past you learned

456
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,240
you learn with the best george santiano

457
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,280
this

458
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:07,760
american philosopher said

459
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,320
longer than 100 years ago that uh those

460
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,440
that don't

461
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:12,559
learn don't remember the past day i

462
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,480
condemn to

463
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,720
to make the same mistakes over and over

464
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,840
again so you the pastor is going to show

465
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,760
you

466
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,918
uh going to give you evidences and

467
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:24,919
indicators is going to

468
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,039
show you mothers or parents and as

469
00:19:24,919 --> 00:19:30,030
spatiotemporal patterns

470
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:31,200
you look at the past and you can tell

specific

models of parandi and they

476
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:42,320
actually go they search for specific

477
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,400
targets so

478
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:46,559
you you can anticipate what's going to

479
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,360
happen in the future based on what

480
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,360
has happened in the past and you need

481
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:53,760
also to observe the present

482
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,039
and it's really important to be always

483

on

00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,400

day in

490
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:13,760
and understand what's happening globally

because any organization either if you

492
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,158
work for organization or

493
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,280
you are the security advisor for them

494
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,039
you need to

495
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,760
to understand external factors that

496
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,960
might be impacting you

497
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,280

a specific group that's gaining momentum

from the school to protest um everyone

503
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,200
like them and they hate you so you need

504
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:44,000
to be ready to

505
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,200
to protect yourself and and for

506
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,679
engagement

507
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:50,000
so with research to understand the

508
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:53,760
future you go and connect the dots

509
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,440
um and you can do you can project

510
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,200
the future and do forecasts and

511
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,000
understand what the new threats and

512
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,280
trends

513
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,520
and so far what we can find uh

514
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:04,559
for most of researches is that the new

515
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,720
waves and new

516
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,600
new trends in terrorism are going to be

00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:11,120
about green

518
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:14,158
terrorism and cyber terrorism

519
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:17,600
um and but still

520
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:20,640
no one can tell uh how soon

521
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,760
and how much they will fully leverage

522
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,320
the cyberspace

523
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:25,200
and they will start for cyberterrorism

524
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,520
or for

525
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,120
green terrorism in interfacing with

526
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,918
activism

527
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,600
those are unknowns uh and then you

528
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:35,440
cannot tell for sure but there's

529
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:38,000
there's a way of addressing the future

530
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,799
when you have sparse information and you

531
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,919
have lack of

532
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:44,960
indicators um

533
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,880
it's okay to be creative like most of

534
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:48,880
people when you talk to them about

535
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,320
terrorism studies and intelligence

536
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,840
studies they will think this is

537
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,840
um very scientific you either have

538
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:58,320
numbers or you don't have and it's

539
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,520
actually not like this

540
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:05,280
you can predict uh based on

541
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,679
on intuition intuition work

542
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,480
in this field uh you just need to go

543
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:11,520
there and

544
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:12,000
get the indicators that will collaborate

545
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,520
with your

546
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,520
intuition and then you have an

547
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:19,200
indication and you you go and

548
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:22,960
further and uh assess that um

549
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:25,039
that line of reasoning that you had uh

550
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,039
personal opinion like expert opinion

551
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,919
matters as well you can get someone with

552
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,400
50 years of

553
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,200
experience and that person might be able

554
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,240
to

555
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,240
to understand uh indicators and

556
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,559
and have an idea what's going to happen

557
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,760
in the future

558
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:46,000
um and for for

559
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,280
when you're working trying to project

560
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,640
the future and you have

561
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,840
you don't have enough data um and you

562
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,799
don't want to

563
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,918
risk

564
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,960
there's the risk of a a confirmation

565
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:02,240
bias

566
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:04,799
like you think that someone uh

567
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,039
this might be the new wave for terrorism

568
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,639
all those guys might be behind attacks

569
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,960
to this organization

570
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,720
and you define inside your mind that

571
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,080
those are the threat agent and you just

572
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:17,039
go and try to find

573
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,199
evidences and data to confirm that and

574
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,720
then it's your bias and you keep going

575
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,840
and when you realize you

576
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:27,919
you've gone to too far

577
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:29,439
and you missed the real point so

578
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,440
one thing that i'm going to do with you

579
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:35,039
at the end of this presentation is a

580
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:36,880
a intelligence analytical

581
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,158
technique called analysis of computing

582
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,360
hypothesis

583
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:43,520
and then we can avoid confirmation bias

584
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,279
and the other approach is what if

585
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,600
technique there is

586
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:49,120
what if analysis is largely used for

587
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:52,158
business nowadays

588
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,439
it's just you start asking what if what

589
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,960
if

590
00:23:53,440 --> 00:24:00,799
the climate movement start

591
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:04,480
interfacing with hacktivism what if

592
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:08,000
those climate change groups go from

593
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,480
very uh pacific no violent people on the

594
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,200
street

595
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,000
straight to sabotaging physical attacks

596
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,559
and then you

597
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,760
again try to to find indicators that

598
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,360
this might happen

599
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,120
and you're gonna dismiss the ones that

600
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,678
you cannot

601
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,678
confirm

602
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:32,959
with the the two new waves of the

603
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:36,158
the two future waves of terrorism

604
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:38,960
that will rely on cyberspace um

605
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,520
what have we seen so far both of them

606
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,039
have

607
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:46,080
used the the cyberspace for propaganda

608
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:49,279
for training for recruiting

609
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,678
they've caused material loss like

610
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:54,000
in special cyber terrorism the cyber

611
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:57,679
version of any type of terrorism

612
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:01,039
uh we haven't seen any casualty yet

613
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:04,080
but there was case where uh

614
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:07,279
some hackers and groups um

615
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,760
tried to to get people killed like

616
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,200
flooding a whole city would be one of

617
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:15,158
those cases

618
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:17,279
um with climate uh

619
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:19,279
eco-terrorism they're very good at

620
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:22,320
propaganda the flying shame the

621
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:25,520
anti-flying movement um they've

622
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:28,799
already threatened to use cyber attacks

623
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:31,840
and um also they like technology

624
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:33,120
they they try to use drones at a airport

625
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,840
location

626
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,199
um they have these fear-based recruiting

627
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,158
approaches like the

628
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,520
the world's gonna collapse in in less

629
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:44,640
than ten years

630
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,520
and the the big users of social media as

631
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,880
well so

632
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:54,400
the the cyber space has

633
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:54,400
enabled many of their activities so far

634
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,678
a bit of the the climate movement uh

635
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:03,279
timeline

636
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:05,760
from the past to to the future so

637
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,799
they they always start as non-violent

638
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,840
grassroots

639
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:11,120
local and small towns and and they have

640
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,559
their claims and

641
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,559
they when they understand that the

642
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,279
governments cannot compromise and

643
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:19,120
and the the organizations cannot

644
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:22,480
compromise to the level

645
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:25,360
of um demands they uh they have

646
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:27,200
and then they escalate in the past they

647
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:30,240
used to escalate to physical

648
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,880
sabotage aquatage setting fires on

649
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,880
things and they had different versions

650
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,760
of those magazines with monkey

651
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,720
ranching like teaching people how to go

652
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,400
and um

653
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,080
and destroy the windshield of an

654
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:46,080
airplane or the

655
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:47,600
the systems uh the pilot would rely on

656
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,760
and all those groups they have one thing

657
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,879
in common it's always bio

658
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:54,879
echo earth the planet is

659
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,080
more important than the people and if

660
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,960
they see that the people

661
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:00,480
are uh threatening the planet they will

662
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:03,919
they

663
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:04,640
eventually go violent with contemporary

664
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,679
times the

665
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,840
the revival of climate movement

666
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,120
we have seen so far the non-violent the

667
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,559
grassroots

668
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:17,279
we have also seen um

669
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:19,760
attacks to property-like they glued

670
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:22,399
themselves on airplanes and runways and

671
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,640
and the the financial losses they they

672
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,039
start showing up like the late flights

673
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,240
and

674
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:32,080
uh locked airports and also

675
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:34,559
the drones the drones actually could um

676
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:36,399
could drones flying where airplanes are

677
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:37,360
flying there's even birds can be

678
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:40,479
dangerous at those

679
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,678
uh those occasions so there was risk to

680
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,440
life there

681
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:45,919
and um also those in current times

682
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,559
things

683
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,399
they inspire cyber attacks against the

684
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,360
organizations that they perceive as a

685
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,760
threat

686
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,678
and against the government and they've

687
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,799
tracked themselves of using cyber

688
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,120
attacks

689
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,080
what's going to happen in the future so

690
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,559
again

691
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:05,120
no one can tell for sure but if you if

692
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:06,879
you study and research

693
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,399
you're gonna see there's this potential

694
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,640
for the interface

695
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,799
a more persistent and continuous

696
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,000
consistent interface between

697
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:18,639
the climate movement and hackers and

698
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,200
and all the sabotage and the disruption

699
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,760
and

700
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,919
their work performed physically back in

701
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,279
time it will migrate to the cyberspace

702
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,360
and we know that

703
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,960
activist groups they are very good with

704
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,719
the doors web devices

705
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:35,039
data theft and distribution and um

706
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:37,039
also the tools that i had to he the the

707
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,799
activists had available for them were

708
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:41,279
not very sophisticated

709
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:43,279
but since now on the internet and the

710
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:46,399
internet you have a

711
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:50,000
botnet for hire there is a

712
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:52,879
after all those leaks and nsa tools they

713
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,880
they many government intelligence tools

714
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,039
got weaponized and they are available

715
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,840
the the algorithms the codes are

716
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,919
available for everyone on the internet

717
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,840
and what's going to happen in the future

718
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,279
this the climate change groups are going

719
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:09,120
to get more support

720
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:11,200
and more more sympathy

721
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,239
and they will recruit more people

722
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,360
because

723
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:18,559
fears is is a great

724
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:21,678
um feeling to get people uh

725
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:26,000
scared and then they will go and and

726
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:29,120
support their cause and they will

727
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,799
try to influence um politics and

728
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,799
participate in politics

729
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,840
here's just one slide showing like the

730
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:43,520
the life threatening

731
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,520
tactics that they resort to

732
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:50,799
and before discussing the

733
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,399
the relationship between aviation and

734
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:54,399
those climate

735
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,000
climate movement groups let's talk about

736
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:59,199
aviation per se

737
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,679
so for the past uh

738
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:04,320
four years a little longer aviation is

739
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,559
uh has been continuously under attack

740
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,480
and uh in parallel to this time there

741
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:11,360
was new

742
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,000
there was a new climate movement

743
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:15,199
appeared

744
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,760
in new legislation climate legislation

745
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,039
and

746
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:21,360
the paris agreement

747
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:23,200
and it might be just a coincidence but

748
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,240
it happened in parallel

749
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:29,679
and uh and when 2020 came

750
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:33,679
and there was and kovit 19

751
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,960
hit the world um the hacking activity

752
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:37,360
against aviation

753
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:39,279
reduce a lot you go you can go and

754
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,918
google you're not gonna find one

755
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:43,520
uh prominent attack against against a

756
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,640
prominent airline

757
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:49,120
and and it was different for the past

758
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,880
years there's many and many like in a

759
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:52,959
continuous fashion

760
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,039
uh what happened since covid is the

761
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,399
aviation is grounded

762
00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:02,799
um and they're not polluting

763
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:05,918
so maybe the perceived activity

764
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:09,519
that um those uh

765
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:11,519
climate inspired hackers um the pers

766
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,519
the pers the activity that was perceived

767
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,720
as an evil it's uh

768
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:19,440
absent now if the motivation was not

769
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,559
financial and they were motivated by the

770
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,320
way they perceived

771
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:26,720
aviation and um it was not only airlines

772
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:29,120
under attack like giants like sabre

773
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,760
and amadeus all those booking systems

774
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,120
and

775
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:34,799
even aviation idea australian oh many

776
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:38,320
facilitators for traveling

777
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:39,360
and they all they were all getting

778
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,639
hacked

779
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:46,479
and it's now not happening

780
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:49,760
at least not public

781
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,399
and then you might say okay they yeah

782
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:54,480
it was only hackers virginia and they

783
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:57,918
they had financial motivation but they

784
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,000
feel sorry for for aviation now

785
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:00,960
so one thing that i've learned long ago

786
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,679
is that hackers

787
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,360
and organized crime and criminals in

788
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:07,360
general they don't feel sorry they have

789
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,879
no conscience they don't feel sorry for

790
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:13,279
anyone and you can see if you look um

791
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,120
for the numbers of a cyber attack

792
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:17,279
studying covetings

793
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,320
it's like you can read the news i

794
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:21,200
haven't on this

795
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,039
slide like five-fold increase and they

796
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,000
hacked the hospitals that are treating

797
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:26,640
cold with people

798
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,799
people that fell sick with kovid they

799
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:29,919
hacked the labs that are studying new

800
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:33,360
vaccines

801
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:38,320
they leverage kovid and have specific

802
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:41,678
um cove inspired fishing campaigns

803
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:44,320
they they don't seem to be sorry for

804
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:46,000
the organization is struggling across

805
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,120
coffee times

806
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,760
what i think is that a the

807
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,559
numbers with the pandemics actually are

808
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,559
showing that

809
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:59,840
um the hackers that were hacking

810
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:02,879
aviation they were not motivated by

811
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:05,439
uh financial gain they were

812
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:11,600
hacking aviation based on what aviation

813
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:13,279
represents to them

814
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:15,439
and then hey did you know what happened

815
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:16,640
to the supply chain because those guys

816
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,039
also don't like the

817
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,240
supply chain they don't like mining they

818
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,158
don't like oil

819
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,519
uh facilities they don't like the

820
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,480
nuclear

821
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,320
field so the supply chain is busier and

822
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,519
busier no one stopped eating the trucks

823
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,158
are on the roads the

824
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,279
the container ships are still sailing

825
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:35,519
and they've

826
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,799
been smashed with the cyber attacks

827
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,120
they've been hacked

828
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:40,639
and this presentation is going to be

829
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:43,760
made available for you uh

830
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:44,799
um the time so you can go and read by

831
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,640
yourself and

832
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:48,559
if you say oh but those are ransomware

833
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,039
attacks uh

834
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:52,000
some of them are ransomware attacks yes

835
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:54,799
everyone can

836
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:56,080
hire a ransomware attack today

837
00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:00,960
everything is

838
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,960
um accessible on the in the internet

839
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,320
so now it's the relationship between

840
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,960
aviation and climate movement

841
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,639
here's what climate movement thinks of

842
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,560
aviation and what they

843
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,839
they want governments to do in relation

844
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,320
to aviation

845
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:17,440
they they don't like the tax benefit

846
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:21,839
aviation has

847
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:23,918
they they want a carbon tax

848
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:26,159
applied to even to passages and they

849
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:29,679
want passage to be able to fly

850
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:32,159
a international flight uh only once

851
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,159
each two years they think the frequent

852
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,560
flyer program should be banned because

853
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:38,720
they

854
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:41,040
award polluting activity they

855
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:42,319
they've single aviation and they

856
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,679
perceive aviation as

857
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:48,000
any meal and they have this strong

858
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:51,200
propaganda and anti-flying movement

859
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,159
like blaming and shaming people and they

860
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:55,839
have goals of

861
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:59,599
net zero emission by 2025 which is not

862
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:02,720
feasible for aviation and when the

863
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,800
uk government tried to help

864
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,439
the aviation industry some airlines to

865
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:10,640
recover from kofi they said if you

866
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,359
help them uh if you bail them out we're

867
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:13,520
gonna

868
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:14,799
hit you with cyber attacks so it's clear

869
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,680
that they

870
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,480
they have something against this

871
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:20,799
specific

872
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:24,240
industry and i just want to show you

873
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,240
some slides with the news

874
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:32,800
it's all about threatening with cyber

875
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,800
attacks and propaganda flying shame

876
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:40,560
saying that aviation is number one of

877
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,560
polluting activities

878
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:46,000
and they have claims they have demands

879
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:47,759
and unfortunately the governments cannot

880
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,800
fulfill their demands the governments

881
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,599
are planning for

882
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,960
net zero emission by 2050 and they're

883
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,920
working hard they have different

884
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:59,119
projects they have decarbonization they

885
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:01,599
they have all the measures in place um

886
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,480
but uh it's still not compatible what

887
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,560
they want and

888
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:10,839
they want it by 2025 um

889
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:13,680
that is like a few years from now

890
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:14,480
and oh and what would happen if they

891
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:16,240
they can

892
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,920
they cannot get to an agreement there's

893
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,560
no compromise

894
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:22,640
i want to show you the the best and the

895
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:25,920
present of uh

896
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,720
warfare how warfare used to escalate in

897
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,480
the past

898
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,078
so in the past there is a country that

899
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,079
is doing something that is not

900
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,640
acceptable attacking the neighbor

901
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:36,240
um and then the rest of the world get

902
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,040
together and have a diplomatic

903
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:42,319
conversation with them okay

904
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:43,040
they hit they just ignored um and then

905
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,800
they start with

906
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,040
more lenient measures like some

907
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:50,079
embargoes commercial sanctions

908
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:52,480
and if uh and they check

909
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,240
okay are you gonna stop now they say

910
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,560
okay we're to stop then

911
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,839
move on everything's good but if that

912
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:00,720
country would insist

913
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:01,839
in continuing with the the that

914
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,959
unacceptable

915
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:06,720
operation so the rest of the world would

916
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,960
resort to physical attack

917
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,480
and the conflict would escalate from the

918
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:14,240
very lenient

919
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:16,800
commercial measure to a physical attack

920
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,680
and nowadays it's slightly different

921
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:20,240
they go with the

922
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:21,200
diplomatic conversation and they go to

923
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,200
sanctions

924
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,279
and if it doesn't work and then they

925
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,359
they go they move to the cyberspace

926
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,359
and from the cyberspace if it still

927
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:31,759
doesn't work then they go to

928
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:33,359
physical attack and maybe coordinate

929
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,839
with cyber attacks

930
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:39,520
um what would happen to

931
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,000
to those demands from the from the

932
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:45,440
climate movement they they cannot uh

933
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:48,079
they cannot be fulfilled by 20-25 so

934
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,520
there's few options um there's this

935
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,079
conversation diplomatic with the

936
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:53,040
government

937
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:55,040
they try to increase taxation to make it

938
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,680
too expensive for people to fly

939
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:58,560
and then it fails uh would they jump

940
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,879
straight to

941
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:03,440
physical attacks and sabotage again

942
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:06,880
against airplanes or trying to bomb in

943
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:09,839
a to

944
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,079
try to bring down a few aircrafts i find

945
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:13,520
it

946
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:15,440
um the less likely option

947
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,960
they wouldn't escalate directly to

948
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:20,160
physical attack but

949
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:23,280
what i think that is um very possible

950
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,200
um and highly likely that they they will

951
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,200
resort to cyber attacks

952
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,520
because cyber attacks can cause all the

953
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,560
damage like if you prevent someone from

954
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:34,320
operating

955
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:36,480
if you exfiltrate and distribute data

956
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,079
that organization is going to get fined

957
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,880
they're going to not being able to

958
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,560
operate

959
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,880
and being fine there will be lots of

960
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:46,720
financial laws include plus the

961
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:50,160
reputation of loss in the

962
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:52,319
oh as in worst-case scenario um

963
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,598
if they start hacking uh connected

964
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,119
airplanes and

965
00:38:53,599 --> 00:39:00,320
they could be causing casualties but

966
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:03,119
i don't think it would escalate so fast

967
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,119
to that point

968
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,880
and here just so you understand what i'm

969
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,400
coming from

970
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,160
um let's look at this analysis of

971
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,200
computing hypothesis

972
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:18,078
what do you do you you you list all your

973
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,040
hypothesis

974
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:21,440
of um who could be a perpetrator the

975
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,119
threat

976
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,960
agent behind a specific attack like

977
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:30,000
persistent ddos

978
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,480
for 12 months now aviation is

979
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,359
under attack and each airline is getting

980
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:36,560
at least

981
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:38,319
three ddoses per month um

982
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:40,320
and no one is calling to ask you for

983
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:43,200
money there's no extortion

984
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,720
um they just want to prevent you from

985
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,520
working

986
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,799
and and then you go to your your threat

987
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,040
agent library and

988
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:52,640
you you list all the thread the threat

989
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,440
agents that you have there

990
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,319
don't go straight to one analyze all of

991
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:58,000
them

992
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,160
and then you're going to assess them

993
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:03,280
against several assumptions

994
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:05,520
so this this threat agent

995
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,680
has the motivation to attack us and if

996
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,880
you if you find data that are consistent

997
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,319
with this assumption

998
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,800
you say yes consistent this threat

999
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:16,319
agent has the means to attack us with

1000
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:19,760
ddos yes

1001
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:21,520
if you find the data and then there's

1002
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:23,040
you have another assumptions there are

1003
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,520
indicators uh

1004
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,480
there is the models operandi of this uh

1005
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:28,560
threat a

1006
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:30,079
agent is compatible with with the

1007
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:34,078
attacks we are

1008
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:36,119
we are suffering now and then you go and

1009
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,640
at least all the consistencies and

1010
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:42,000
inconsistencies and you go and

1011
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:44,799
stop and start eliminating the one um

1012
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,640
the hypothesis that has more has the

1013
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,800
most inconsistent data

1014
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,920
and then you eliminate the second one

1015
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,400
that has uh

1016
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,599
most inconsistent data until you get to

1017
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,079
the one that has more

1018
00:40:53,599 --> 00:40:56,880
consistency but you make sure make sure

1019
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,000
you

1020
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,079
you assess all uh all hypothesis

1021
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,280
against all assumptions and you can have

1022
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,920
as many assumptions

1023
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:06,960
as needed and this is a very simplified

1024
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,240
version of a

1025
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:12,640
analysis of computing hypothesis and

1026
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,839
my i've have passed the limit time

1027
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,560
already

1028
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:18,000
