um so let's get into it um

40
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,240
the agenda we're going to look at the

41
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,439
market view and the internal view

42
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,960
we're going to look at some market

43
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,080
forces we're going to look at the ceo

44
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,839
agenda

45
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,000
we'll look at delivering on trust and

46
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,759
the challenges associated with that

47
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,840
we're going to look at the opportunity

48
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,560
uh associated with them challenges and

49
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,439
some ways you can solve them uh

50
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,799
challenges

51
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,798
and and really harness them

52
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,520
opportunities and they're going to leave

53
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:42,479
you with some

54
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,479
key takeaways

55
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,759
so i wanted to focus on one global

56
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,559
report in particular i could have chosen

57
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,799
from the

58
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:54,640
mandiant report i could have chosen from

59
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,000
the verizon report it could have chosen

60
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,399
the crowdstrike

61
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,119
um numerous other reports including our

62
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,799
own uh

63
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,479
lastpass global state of the password

64
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,240
report but for this particular

65
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:05,360
presentation i wanted to just focus on

66
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,720
the alliance risk

67
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,000
barometer report 2020. this year's

68
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,280
report is based on

69
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,640
insights from just over 2 700 risk

70
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,239
management experts from

71
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,160
over 100 countries and territories

72
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,920
worldwide and

73
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,000
you know getting into the detail of the

74
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,440
report key finding

75
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,680
and the big thing about the report this

76
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,440
year is that cyber incidents are ranked

77
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,440
as the number one business risk coming

78
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,640
in at 39

79
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,920
this is versus a position of 7 in 2013

80
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,040
where only 15

81
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,958
said that cyber incidents were a risk

82
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,480
and there's a list of sectors there the

83
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,000
top six sectors

84
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,040
that mentioned cyber incidents as the

85
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,440
biggest risk

86
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,799
aviation financial services government

87
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,920
of public services

88
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,790
professional services technology

89
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,160
and telecommunications

90
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:59,200
[Music]

91
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:02,400
additionally the report was able to

92
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,040
identify some key trends and some of the

93
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,440
trends

94
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,599
are around the size and the expense

95
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,840
associated with different data breaches

96
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,679
we see that the size of the marriott the

97
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,159
equifax in capital one

98
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,959
data breaches ranging into the thousands

99
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,040
of records

100
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,680
sorry millions of records i should say

101
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:22,799
that that um that were compromised

102
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:26,480
um we also see a growth

103
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:28,799
in business email compromise um you know

104
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,159
earlier earlier this year the fbi in the

105
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,959
u.s

106
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,239
said that since 2016 and there's been

107
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,720
worldwide losses

108
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,000
of at least 26 billion due to business

109
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,680
even compromise and

110
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,159
such attacks typically involve social

111
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:44,799
engineering and phishing emails

112
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,319
to pretty much uh duke or con employees

113
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,799
and senior management into revealing

114
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,200
login

115
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,599
login credentials so that they can make

116
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,159
fraudulent transactions

117
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,000
we see litigation prospects rising a

118
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,798
number of large breaches have triggered

119
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,239
class actions by consumers or investors

120
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,200
for example again

121
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:06,319
equifax in july 2019 reached a 700

122
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:10,079
million settlement for its uh for its 27

123
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:12,000
2017 data breach and then finally we see

124
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,879
mergers and acquisitions bring in

125
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,320
cyber security issues so if we look at

126
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,680
marius who acquired

127
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,880
starwood in 2016 that breach can be

128
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,320
traced back to an intrusion in 2014

129
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,560
in star wars so that was sitting in

130
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:30,240
their network and on their network for

131
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,720
you know four or five years um

132
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:34,240
so as i said you know cyber incidents

133
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,400
number one risk globally

134
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,560
um it's also just important to know

135
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,320
stats while it's the number one risk

136
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,840
globally across them sectors that i've

137
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,800
mentioned

138
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:45,758
there it's a very close second in a lot

139
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,160
of other sectors

140
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,000
so take for example transportation you

141
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,080
see business interruption ranks as

142
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,479
number one at 32

143
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,280
with cyber risk uh ranking the cyber

144
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,880
incidence ranking at number two with 30

145
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,960
and it's a new entrance cyber instance

146
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,919
our new entrant um

147
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,719
into that particular area at 30 um this

148
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,840
year

149
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,880
so as you can see it's a it's it's it's

150
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,000
um

151
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,600
it's a it's it's a real uh a real eye

152
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,880
opener globally in terms of cyber

153
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,880
incidents and the risk that they're pros

154
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,199
it's also worth noting that uh

155
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,360
regardless of the org sites

156
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,960
uh cyber incidence is ranked either

157
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,160
first or second so for the small

158
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,479
enterprise it's ranked

159
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,000
in number one but in the other two uh

160
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,520
segments if you like the medium

161
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:36,720
and large um businesses it ranks

162
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,719
second so if it's ranking that high

163
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,800
what do aliens say are the causes of the

164
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:44,080
cyber incidents well

165
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,960
in first place 77 it's data or security

166
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:49,919
breach

167
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:52,400
um at 62 it's espionage hacker

168
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:53,120
ransomware denial of service and in

169
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,159
third place

170
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,360
its employees mistakes by employees

171
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,560
coming in at 42

172
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,560
which is which is quite high

173
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:06,318
another another area that i wanted to

174
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,318
just hone in on was the ndb report

175
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:12,880
um you know i i

176
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,360
enjoy as much as anyone can enjoy uh

177
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,159
reading

178
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,479
uh the ndp report because it lays things

179
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,680
out in a really succinct and detailed

180
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,639
fashion

181
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,759
and so what we seen in h1 of 2020 was

182
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,680
that there was

183
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:31,199
518 data breaches um notified

184
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,000
we have 61 percent um where malicious or

185
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:34,880
criminal attacks are the the leading

186
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,680
cause

187
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,199
we have 85 percent of them breaches

188
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:42,800
involved information

189
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,880
um of a thousand individuals or less

190
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,560
um and then the top five sectors where

191
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,600
the breaches notifications came from

192
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,880
were health

193
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:54,240
finance education insurance

194
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,880
and legal so how did these breaches

195
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,039
happen

196
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:02,400
um well as you can see there

197
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:04,479
34 percent were down to human error um

198
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,239
five percent were down to system fault

199
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:08,159
um so human error would

200
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:10,000
you know encompass wrong email uh

201
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,000
recipient um

202
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,840
you know maybe maybe loss of paperwork a

203
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,960
device um or unauthorized accidental

204
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,159
disclosure system fault

205
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,880
um would you know cover unintended

206
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,160
access

207
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,520
um or unattended publication

208
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,360
and then we would have then the

209
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,440
malicious or criminal attacks

210
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,280
like you mentioned coming in at 61

211
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,080
earlier um

212
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,039
and they are relating to a cyber

213
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,318
incident

214
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:41,120
uh social engineering rogue employees

215
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,240
and paper or device uh paper storage or

216
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,680
device storage

217
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:48,160
theft um it's worth noting actually yes

218
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,879
in in the first half of 2020 there was a

219
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,240
there was a rise in insider threat and

220
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,919
social engineering

221
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,160
um even compared to uh 2019 reports

222
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,198
um and i guess that that probably isn't

223
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,120
surprising really

224
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,360
given that remote work has been you know

225
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,680
enforced upon us and many of us will be

226
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,000
working remotely going forward that you

227
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,599
know we're an easy target for uh

228
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,759
for hackers and people looking to count

229
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:16,960
us out of credentials

230
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:20,400
and so move on to the internal view

231
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:23,280
um so is there a common problem well

232
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,239
your i.t teams and security teams may be

233
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,559
reporting in

234
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,680
an increase in these type of errors

235
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,840
popping up

236
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,440
um given people are working more

237
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,039
remotely and we're trying to get people

238
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,440
more productive

239
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:36,640
so as you can see here that there's an

240
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,279
id10

241
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,039
t error has a chord the location of the

242
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,838
error is between the keyboard and the

243
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,519
chair

244
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,000
you have to eliminate that problem

245
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,680
before proceeding any further

246
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,480
or the error 27c problem exists between

247
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,479
keyboard and chair

248
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,719
and look for me it's easy to say that

249
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,279
these errors are the source of the

250
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,000
problem

251
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,720
but actually the source of the problem

252
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,080
is not

253
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,320
is that people don't have the right

254
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,160
tools and aren't enabled to do their

255
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,160
jobs in a secure manner

256
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,439
um cyber security and cyber crime is

257
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,160
hard for people to get their heads

258
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,240
around

259
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,000
you know people don't see themselves

260
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,680
individually as a risk

261
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,519
um and you know if they're not prepared

262
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,880
and they're not on their guard

263
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,880
you know all the time that they're

264
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,080
potentially a weak point within the

265
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,040
organization

266
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,800
well then you know you know they they

267
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,199
are a potential access point for calm

268
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,240
people

269
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:34,000
so you know for me i think that

270
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,680
when we talk about cyber security within

271
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,640
the industry i think we alienate a lot

272
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,800
of people

273
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:40,800
um particularly the word cyber sounds

274
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,800
very futuristic and complex

275
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,719
um you know i know that when i was

276
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,880
studying and if someone mentioned

277
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:49,279
applied physics or even physics to me

278
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,000
i would have zoned out um and that's how

279
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,080
an awful lot of people

280
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,320
see cyber security and so if we make it

281
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,000
that it's not an inclusive conversation

282
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,680
people will disengage and that's

283
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,200
absolutely what you don't want

284
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,719
particularly when it comes to securing

285
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,600
the business and particularly when you

286
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:05,200
see

287
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:07,440
42 is down to human error

288
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,240
in the alliance report and you see it as

289
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,399
a constant

290
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,200
uh constant error or constant area for

291
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:15,519
concern in the ndp report

292
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,959
and that's how a lot of the board and

293
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,959
senior management see it too

294
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,160
they see it as some complex that they

295
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,279
don't understand

296
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,319
or maybe they can't understand um and so

297
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,320
that needs to change

298
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,600
so switching to the market forces um

299
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,800
let's see what's putting security on the

300
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,519
boardroom agenda

301
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,279
um and as the business goes more digital

302
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,120
different forces drive the board to

303
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,320
focus on different business models with

304
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,320
different threats

305
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,399
um and this is now where we get into

306
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,000
more detail from the idc and last past

307
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,399
sponsored report

308
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,440
so just going through a couple of these

309
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,040
different forces

310
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,480
operating in the climate of

311
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,439
uncertainties right you know

312
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,640
we've seen natural disasters obviously

313
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,399
cyber attacks

314
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,720
the end of the extended uncertainty or

315
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,800
in the period around covert 19

316
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,120
um and the pressures that's based on

317
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,959
placed on businesses to operate and

318
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:10,160
and be more and be productive and still

319
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,319
be competitive

320
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,199
you know across the apac region a work

321
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,120
from home mandate

322
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,560
has pushed an uptick in video meetings

323
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,360
audio conference calls

324
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,680
and collaborating platforms securing and

325
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,160
validating the identity of the end user

326
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,920
accessing them services remotely is more

327
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,680
critical than ever

328
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,199
and not all organizations have that

329
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,519
culture or experience

330
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,800
or the technology to enable and enforce

331
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:37,839
that remote office edges

332
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:41,120
we see organizations now becoming

333
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:44,079
more borderless you know by 2024

334
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,079
uh 25 of asia's top 1000 companies in

335
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,719
the apac region will rely on a global

336
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,040
secure

337
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,279
integrated and collaborative ecosystem

338
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,680
that enables enterprises to function

339
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:55,760
as borders organizations this is going

340
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,479
to require i.t security systems that

341
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,639
support an

342
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:00,480
online collaborative environment to

343
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,639
drive business outcomes

344
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,079
and you know that's where then the

345
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,639
security perimeter

346
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,000
um gets pushed further and further and

347
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:11,839
further away from

348
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,839
from the core of the office

349
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,079
you see rising expectations of superior

350
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,720
digital experiences

351
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,760
you know people want to have a really

352
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,360
good experience

353
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:24,480
and they also want to know that it's

354
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,639
secure but they also don't want um

355
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,680
a lot of friction in how they engage

356
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,519
them different experiences

357
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,199
key investment area to deliver on is

358
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:36,320
digital transformation goals

359
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,760
um and that you know in doing so secure

360
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,480
by designing principles

361
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:42,399
must be core to success adopting a

362
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,120
highest level of compliance approach

363
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,800
even if it's not mandatory mandated is a

364
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,240
driver to engendering trust and

365
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,959
transforming the business for

366
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,240
competitive agility we look at the

367
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,279
future workforce

368
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,200
accord and idc again the apac future

369
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,600
workforce survey 45

370
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,880
organization survey have implemented are

371
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,920
planning to implement

372
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:06,639
a contingency plan to

373
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,839
to address their hiring policies to fill

374
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,480
the gap that

375
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,880
that is there in terms of digital skills

376
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,160
the growing pool of contingency workers

377
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,160
and the move towards collaborative

378
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,880
workspaces and rising millennial

379
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,560
workforce

380
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:22,270
called for a new flexible workforce

381
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,599
policy without sacrifice and security

382
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,959
[Music]

383
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,560
you so really start getting into the

384
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,638
security side of things here now we see

385
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:32,000
the lack of i.t and security skills

386
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,600
right so organizations globally are

387
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,639
suffering really bad we're trying to

388
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:41,040
fill security skill sets

389
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:43,279
and the apac area is no different um

390
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,279
i think security is probably the only

391
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,680
profession globally where there's

392
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,439
you know greater demand than there is

393
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,439
availability of resources

394
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,199
and that's not going to change so making

395
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:55,440
sure that you can address

396
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,959
and and make sure that the people within

397
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,760
your organization are adding value at

398
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,599
every turn

399
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,959
and that they feel valued at every turn

400
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,320
particularly from the security side the

401
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,880
house would be very important

402
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,959
because if not they will leave and then

403
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,800
we see the the crisis of digital trust

404
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,000
right bad decisions poor leadership

405
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,920
complexity

406
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,600
cyber crime resulting breaches that have

407
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,639
significant impact on businesses and

408
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,680
customers

409
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:20,079
new approaches such as zero trust um

410
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,519
are starting to prove themselves um

411
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,279
identity and access management is the

412
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,120
number two investment priority for apac

413
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,600
businesses and organizations

414
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,199
and moving the security strategy from

415
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,240
the system or device to the new control

416
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:33,120
control

417
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,800
plane of data application and identity

418
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,839
is considered to be the best strategic

419
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,839
and comprehensive approach

420
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,439
and so now we look at the ceo's new

421
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:45,839
agenda in the digital economy

422
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,519
and you know aligning to the forces that

423
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:49,519
we just mentioned earlier on

424
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:51,279
and we see the trust comes in ahead of

425
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,560
delivering innovative experience at

426
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,800
scale

427
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,839
and ensuring reliability and digital

428
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,279
services and

429
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:01,360
experiences and so

430
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,439
you know that begs the question why is

431
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,040
trust so important

432
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,440
well in the corporate world trust is

433
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,760
high on the agenda with trust you can

434
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:10,800
gain loyalty loyal customer base build a

435
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,279
strong brand

436
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,800
resulting in a strong market presence

437
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,839
for an organization addressing the

438
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,079
target market

439
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:20,480
if they can gain their target markets

440
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,160
trust then they can be very successful

441
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,519
trust is about making people feel a

442
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,920
certain way and people feel very

443
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,079
strongly about how their data is handled

444
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,680
to do business in the digital economy

445
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:31,199
people need to share data such as

446
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,000
address name

447
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,800
data birth credit card details etc

448
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,480
without that

449
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,399
in the digital economy you don't have a

450
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,079
business one of the ways that

451
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:43,040
organizations can maintain

452
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,719
their trust is true protecting data the

453
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,399
digital economy is data-driven

454
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:49,040
and it's extremely important to protect

455
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,360
all data managing the access to data

456
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,199
and business applications goes a long

457
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,199
way to mitigating the risk of a data

458
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:58,000
breach and severely limiting the

459
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:00,880
potential risk exposure to your brand

460
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,240
you know i mentioned equifax earlier on

461
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:04,160
uh mentioned

462
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,480
you know their data breach on a recent

463
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:08,800
cso online article published

464
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:11,360
reported that two years after the breach

465
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:13,839
the company said it has spent 1.4

466
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:15,519
billion on cleanup costs including

467
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,399
incremental costs to transform their

468
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,920
technology

469
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,680
and improve their application network

470
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,959
and data security

471
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,680
and then if that wasn't enough in june

472
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,959
2019 moody's downgraded the company's

473
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,719
financial rating

474
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:30,560
in part because of the massive amounts

475
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,680
you would need to spend on infosec in

476
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,040
the years to come

477
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,719
so even though they were trying to do

478
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:38,480
the right thing now they're still

479
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,240
feeling the after effects of that breach

480
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,079
so when organizations are evaluating the

481
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,880
risk exposure to the business through

482
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,040
audits

483
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:46,480
a large area of focus is typically who

484
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,160
has access to what

485
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,720
why do they have access and do they

486
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,199
still need access the reality is if you

487
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,639
don't

488
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,359
if you don't take access management

489
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,079
seriously you're running a serious risk

490
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,079
of being breached

491
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:02,240
so now we look at how we deliver on that

492
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,880
trust

493
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,160
right so given the forces uh influencing

494
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,039
the border of agenda

495
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,000
and the ceo priority this slide details

496
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:14,319
the top goals

497
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,319
and to achieve trust

498
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,079
and the interesting thing here about

499
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,839
this graph is a while

500
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,599
mfa um and uh passwordless

501
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,520
and the access controls are in sixth and

502
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:30,399
seventh place here respectively

503
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:32,320
they're actually core to achieving um

504
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,000
the deliverance here in the top tree

505
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,120
protecting internal and sensitive data

506
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,440
and disclosure

507
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,799
implementing data privacy requirements

508
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,520
and improving the ability to remain

509
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,440
compliant

510
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,480
and anticipate future compliance

511
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,679
standards so while it's great to see

512
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,440
you know um the the uh

513
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,280
the multi-factor or passwordless

514
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,919
authentication and confined and

515
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,879
sensitive

516
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:56,080
uh confined sensitive data access into a

517
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,480
defined user group

518
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,918
they are actually core to delivering on

519
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,440
on the top tree and they can all be

520
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:04,320
delivered with identity and access

521
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,320
management solutions

522
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,639
one of the challenges is time right

523
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:15,919
where are people spending their time

524
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,200
and how can how can we um you know

525
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,480
understand where to spend their time and

526
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,080
then understand where the value is

527
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,120
associated at that time

528
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:25,039
so again without the idc report

529
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,120
enterprises with at least 500 plus

530
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,960
employees surveyed by idc

531
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,639
have an average of 23 full-time

532
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,280
employees in the writing security

533
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,360
department

534
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:35,440
with more resources focused on iam than

535
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,000
in any other security area

536
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,080
identity solutions with improved ease of

537
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,440
use and greater automation can help cut

538
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,760
down on time spent

539
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,840
managing users and identities which in

540
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:47,679
turn ensures better use of security

541
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,520
resources elsewhere

542
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,799
deploying a comprehensive attention

543
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,720
access management strategy

544
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:54,559
is not about removing head count from

545
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,120
the business and that's important point

546
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,720
to note and it's not about doing more

547
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,479
with less people

548
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:02,400
it's about people in the security team

549
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,720
adding value where it matters

550
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,679
and considering uh the importance of

551
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,440
trap management

552
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,080
and the other areas the ability to

553
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,360
transfer valuable resources by improving

554
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,120
identity and access management

555
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,760
efficiencies would be considered a

556
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,639
strange

557
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:18,000
strategic move and one that adds value

558
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,280
and even if you just look at the graph

559
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,480
there you can see that at 29.1 percent

560
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,320
you know you'd have to think that

561
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,600
there's there is a better way of doing

562
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:28,720
identity management

563
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:30,559
and that these costs these uh these um

564
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,160
surveyed accounts are doing and that

565
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,080
they can then you know

566
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,000
bring that percentage down but then

567
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,520
spend more time on vulnerability

568
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,080
management track management and trust

569
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,080
management

570
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:47,120
next challenge is obviously resource and

571
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:48,720
and technology right and so it makes

572
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,479
sense to have your it

573
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,400
uh security team focus on adding value

574
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,000
to what they do because finding people

575
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,799
to do the tasks is getting harder and

576
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,720
harder

577
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,840
finding security skills the world over

578
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,440
is difficult

579
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,879
and the apac is no different and as the

580
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:03,440
slide says

581
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,440
30 of apac organizations suffer from a

582
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,240
lack of skills to ensure reliable

583
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,000
secure digital services and we see that

584
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,640
you know singapore australia and new

585
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,799
zealand

586
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,840
are above average it makes it harder to

587
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,000
get the right people

588
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,760
so if you have people working on tasks

589
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,600
where they feel they're not adding value

590
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,440
then you will not hold on to it in

591
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,199
addition if you're looking for staff and

592
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:26,240
the tasks you want them to focus on

593
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,520
are you know manual in the extreme you

594
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,919
won't get them people to join the

595
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,918
company

596
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,600
so if we move into the second part of

597
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,600
the slide you know we can see the

598
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,918
businesses are still warming up to mfa

599
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,439
and federation for enhanced security

600
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,520
twenty three point four percent of

601
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,799
impact organizations plan to deploy

602
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,158
mfa for all users access and sensitive

603
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:49,360
data

604
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:51,200
thirty point four um of the same

605
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,080
organizations are considering or

606
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:57,360
piloting identity federation plans

607
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,678
but concerningly you know 29

608
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:01,120
or just over 29 surveyed are not even

609
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:03,600
considering this

610
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,439
federation so the linking of a person's

611
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,480
single authentication across multiple

612
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,159
systems

613
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,080
will increase in adoption as more

614
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,760
organizations realize its value in

615
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,879
simplifying security

616
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,039
and reducing the amount of

617
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,520
administration to free up resources

618
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:20,879
for other critical security roles as

619
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,879
discussed on the previous slide

620
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,679
and so this is where we get into the way

621
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,360
forward

622
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,120
part of the presentations how do we

623
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:32,719
address them challenges

624
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:34,799
and uh opportunities well

625
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:37,520
you know along with idc we've identified

626
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,879
five drivers to support business needs

627
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,559
now i'm not going to go in through all

628
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,280
of these i'm going to look in more

629
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,639
detail

630
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,799
on driver number two four and five

631
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,320
but this is where we start to align the

632
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,280
business needs the influence is the

633
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,678
business

634
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,120
the it security challenges finding a

635
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:55,919
common trend

636
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,840
and so driver number two focuses on

637
00:21:55,919 --> 00:22:00,080
managing identity and digital scale to

638
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,720
enable digital transformation

639
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,320
um from a business perspective there are

640
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,559
departments out there who are deploying

641
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,240
solutions in isolation

642
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,600
and as the solutions are being sold to

643
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:12,320
the business function

644
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,439
and not the it buyer that creates a big

645
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,720
problem

646
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,120
so you know the the security challenge

647
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,360
here

648
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,559
is where decentralized tasks core and

649
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,039
security is not involved

650
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,840
how can they reduce that risk exposure

651
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,280
well

652
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,879
the solution isn't providing a

653
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:29,520
consistent approach

654
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,559
to access and authentication to reduce

655
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,200
the exposure

656
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:34,639
to internal and external threats so the

657
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,840
likes of mfa and sso

658
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:39,440
across all competitive apps and then epm

659
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,399
or enterprise password management for

660
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,880
what sso cannot cover

661
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,039
and then for where and when security is

662
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:50,159
involved and they add that you know

663
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:52,158
stamp of credibility then that also

664
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,120
elevates the project that said the other

665
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,960
departments are trying to roll out

666
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,639
this also has tries to help address the

667
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,600
driver in the last slide about user

668
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,520
experience

669
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:06,240
or sorry in the in in stage one

670
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,000
um about user experience and if it's

671
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,679
uniform across all entry points then

672
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
people will know what to expect

673
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:14,000
and they get comfortable with it as was

674
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,600
the case pre-covert 19 workforce

675
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,080
mobility was on the rise

676
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,439
again consistency at scale here adds

677
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,120
huge value

678
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,120
having the same experience and scaling

679
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,320
across apps and geographies is a huge

680
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,479
benefit

681
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,639
it's also important to note that you

682
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,799
know with the right identity solution

683
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,320
and being able to roll that out and give

684
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,720
the uniform experience

685
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,080
across the board it doesn't matter then

686
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,280
where the person works from

687
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,720
if they're in the office to have the

688
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,799
same experience or if they're working

689
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,480
from home to have the same experience

690
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,799
bringing greater security to your

691
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,799
business

692
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,520
look at driver number four then and

693
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,120
integrate an identity to support

694
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,720
operational excellence

695
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,199
every business is looking for

696
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,240
efficiencies and with security we have

697
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,279
people who want

698
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:02,080
who we want to have working smarter not

699
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,159
harder

700
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,360
and that means taking the low value

701
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,919
tasks away from them

702
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,559
or certainly automating a lot of tasks

703
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,320
um

704
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,678
but for securing the challenges that

705
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,879
were disparate solutions

706
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:17,919
and per not for for fit for purpose

707
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,960
and deployments these result in low

708
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,480
value tasks that need

709
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:24,159
manual support manual integration um

710
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,840
which leads to challenges in the talent

711
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,520
retention

712
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:29,199
so the solution here is really to drive

713
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,879
for a unified approach

714
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,559
of services which can lead to more

715
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,080
comprehensive security covering with

716
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,520
fewer blind spots

717
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,600
and that can be easily managed with

718
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,120
vendors they keep adding value through

719
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,879
their service offer

720
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,479
this results in security focusing on the

721
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,880
bigger picture have been able to be

722
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,120
involved or get involved in the projects

723
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,799
that they should be involved in this

724
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,320
leads to better staff retention

725
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:53,600
as they're working on more impactful

726
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:55,039
things reducing operating costs

727
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,360
by doing things in a more efficient

728
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,320
manner and then the automation of low

729
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,639
value tasks

730
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,559
which can support compliance and leave

731
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,240
you know no single points of failure

732
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:05,440
aligned to a particular person

733
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,840
if and when they might leave the

734
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,320
business successfully identity

735
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,320
environment requires multiple elements

736
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,000
and management dashboards but adding

737
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,678
complexity through deployment of

738
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,279
multiple disparate tools

739
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:19,600
is actually counterproductive to

740
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:22,960
security team and environment needs

741
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,559
and so again here you can see that by

742
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:26,640
you know having a better more

743
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,960
streamlined approach within the security

744
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,400
team

745
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,640
within the tools and the offerings that

746
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,039
the security team has

747
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:34,960
they can then be more efficient and

748
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:37,440
drive more operational excellence

749
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,000
operational excellence of which the the

750
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,960
business

751
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,000
puts a lot of value in and then we move

752
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:44,400
on to driver number

753
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,559
five managing enterprise risk through

754
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,679
trusted identity

755
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:50,000
and this is where the business sees

756
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:51,760
security team as a true value driver

757
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,200
you know full alignment between business

758
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,600
and security teams

759
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,039
um but the you know and the security

760
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,279
challenge here is that

761
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,720
really it's the the combination of all

762
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:03,200
of the previous drivers

763
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,360
you know embracing trusted identity can

764
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,919
align the risk appetite of the business

765
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,678
so if identity is a new perimeter then

766
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,080
contextually aware authentication can

767
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,039
apply

768
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,720
policies based on user conditions

769
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,400
fostering good cyber hygiene through the

770
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,120
right tools and awareness

771
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:20,880
can reduce the risk profile from fishing

772
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,760
insider threat as we've seen has grown

773
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,200
earlier on

774
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,200
and third-party supply chain

775
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,039
vulnerabilities

776
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,880
if everything is focused on identity

777
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:30,158
then security can embed

778
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,919
right at the core of the business

779
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:34,960
decisions and strategy

780
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:37,440
but this is a clear value add security

781
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:40,240
driving down the risk true risk

782
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,240
optimization

783
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,158
so what does a unified security offering

784
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,400
look like well

785
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,240
it looks like this so some of you may be

786
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,480
one up to 25 million people globally

787
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,159
that use lastpass personally or work in

788
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,039
one of the 70 000 organizations

789
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,279
worldwide

790
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,879
at lastpass that use our lastpass

791
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,640
business solution

792
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,440
lastpass enterprise is the password

793
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,760
manager and sso solution in one

794
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:07,840
because we believe that sso only covers

795
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,240
part of the password challenge

796
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:12,080
and the password manager covers the rest

797
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:13,200
so our sso solution is fully

798
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,439
self-service

799
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,200
no pds required for setup all

800
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,399
instructions are on our website

801
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,399
um for each of the 1200 plus apps that

802
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:24,719
you can integrate with

803
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,559
then we have lastpass mfa which can be

804
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,640
purchased as standalone or as part of

805
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:31,440
the bundle which i'll speak about next

806
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,880
fastpass mfa is the biometric based mfa

807
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,679
with many policy controls in the

808
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,399
background

809
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,600
such as geofencing login approved ip

810
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:40,239
address range

811
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,678
approval for time of day day of week

812
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,760
access for example

813
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,880
um and then as i mentioned when you

814
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,039
bundle them together

815
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,000
you get our lastpass identity so you get

816
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:50,399
the password manager

817
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,679
you get sso then you get multi-factor

818
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:55,039
authentication or mfa

819
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:56,240
all in one so sso

820
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:58,960
and password manager to manage the

821
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:02,240
access and mfa to authenticate that

822
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,559
access request some

823
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,880
key takeaways then very briefly from me

824
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,639
you know

825
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,399
you're not just building uh for the

826
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,640
short term digital business

827
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:15,600
is becoming the only form of business

828
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,679
and this must be a long term strategy

829
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,439
individuals as we've seen in the ndp

830
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,480
report and seen in the alliance report

831
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,039
and we see

832
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:24,720
loads of different reports they are the

833
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:26,399
unwitting threat factor

834
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,120
help them overcome this issue and

835
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:32,000
empower them to do the right thing

836
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,199
i.t security is mostly overwhelmed um

837
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,559
and we've seen that through some of the

838
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,799
challenges in terms of

839
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:39,120
desperate solutions in terms of head

840
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,840
count focus etc so finding automated and

841
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,639
user-friendly

842
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,000
alternatives um means that you know you

843
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,279
will be able to hold on to your scarce

844
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,960
resource

845
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:49,279
the prevalence of cloud is changing our

846
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,320
control points so identity is core to

847
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,399
delivering the ceo

848
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,720
priority of trust ensure it gets

849
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,239
sufficient attention

850
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,000
but then last but not least you know

851
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:01,200
business investments need to align

852
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:05,919
to positive outcomes trust as an enabler

853
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,919
