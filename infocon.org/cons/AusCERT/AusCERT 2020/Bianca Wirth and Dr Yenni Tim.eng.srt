1
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,320
good afternoon

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,280
and uh welcome to the afternoon sessions

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,400
for

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,480
day one of ulcer 2020. um

5
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,759
just let me check to see if there's any

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,840
other new announcements

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,119
i don't believe there are just a

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,198
reminder

9
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,640
add your q a to the questions on the

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,039
right-hand side or

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,320
potentially the speakers might call for

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:28,400
live questions i haven't had a chance to

13
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,359
talk to them about it

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,879
and we will continue in a second so i'd

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,760
like to welcome to the stage

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,040
bianca worth and yenni tim discussing

17
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,719
how to use machine

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,719
how to use data and machine learning to

19
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,680
improve your resilience to phishing

20
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,000
and improve your education program hi

21
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,840
everyone

22
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,840
how's it going uh i think we're okay

23

okay fantastic uh so thank you very much

33
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,759
everybody for attending the session

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,320
today

35
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,520
please feel free to ask questions in the

36
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,520
q a

37
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,200
we've got lots of content to get through

38
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,880
so hopefully we'll be able to impart

39
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,240
some of our

40
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:37,600
research some of our

41
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,679
tips and tricks on fishing awareness

42
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,759
and education programs and machine

43
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,880
learning and and

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,119
how to manage uh data in in that way

45
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,880
in to report uh on your fishing

46
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,920
awareness programs

47
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,720
so um i've got with me i'm bianca worth

48
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,119
so i'm a director of cyber at kpmg

49
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,920
and i go i've got with me today uh dr

50
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,280
yanni tim

51
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,439
yenni would you like to just introduce

52
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,799
yourself hi everyone i'm jenny i'm a

53
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:08,000
senior lecturer from unsw

54
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,759
fantastic um so we'll kick

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,200
off with a little bit of uh introduction

56
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,839
to fishing awareness then we'll move

57
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,238
into

58
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,239
uh the research that we conducted around

59
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,120
and around using machine learning to

60
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,599
look at the data

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:20,239
around phishing simulations and then

62
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,679
we'll um

63
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,280
end up the session with some tips and

64
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,800
tricks and like i said feel free to ask

65
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,160
as many questions as you like

66
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,840
we've got lots of content to get through

67
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,400
but we'll try to leave um some time at

68
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,840
the end for

69
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:33,599
a q a so essentially when we're looking

70
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,760
at uh the key elements of phishing

71
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,160
awareness there's three key areas that

72
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,280
you

73
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,040
want to look at the first is ensuring

74
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,599
the people that you're targeting

75
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,799
have the requisite knowledge to change

76
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,399
their ways

77
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,840
so this is teaching them about what they

78
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,800
need to know

79
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,400
about cyber security the second area is

80
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,239
the way that they think and you'll see a

81
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,120
little bit further on in the slides that

82
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,640
we talk a little bit

83
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,879
touch on a little bit around the

84
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,440
psychology of phishing

85
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,079
so the thinking aspect is is one

86
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,920
critical

87
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,519
element that you need to consider in the

88
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,079
way that you educate and make people

89
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,280
aware

90
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,760
of phishing campaigns and

91
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:13,440
the third is that you want them to the

92
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,159
goal of every education awareness

93
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,040
campaign

94
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,599
in security is to get people to take an

95
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,359
action

96
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,679
you've got a call to action at the end

97
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,720
of the campaign um or at the end of a

98
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,720
communication that you um produce so we

99
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,319
want to make sure that there's a call to

100
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,159
appropriate call to action and in the

101
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,238
case of phishing it might be

102
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,599
report the phishing um email or

103
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,959
suspected phishing email

104
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,040
to xyz your sock or

105
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,000
the relevant team or person if you're a

106
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,000
small organization

107
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,159
so some of the common challenges that we

108
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,720
see around phishing simulations

109
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,200
and educational awareness in phishing is

110
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,439
uh

111
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,720
generally a lack of evidence and risk

112
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,439
based approach and by that

113
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,720
i mean um you know actually looking at

114
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,400
the data and that's why we

115
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,920
undertook this research project to be

116
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,200
able to delve into the data and

117
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,879
determine really

118
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,760
why are people clicking on these

119
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:10,079
phishing emails what's making them do it

120
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,000
um and then obviously taking a risk

121
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,439
based approach in terms of designing

122
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,760
your fishing simulation

123
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,798
or phishing education awareness program

124
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,358
to

125
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,478
target the appropriate levels of people

126
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,520
appropriate groups

127
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:26,000
risk groups and the reason for that is

128
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,960
you know you may not have a lot of money

129
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,680
in your

130
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,400
education campaign and so therefore you

131
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,479
need to

132
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,919
target the higher risk groups and they

133
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:35,359
may be you know after you've gone

134
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,479
through a risk assessment

135
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,639
they may be the people that um

136
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,000
for example work in finance you know

137
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,560
they've got privileged access to

138
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,199
transfer

139
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,840
funds um and they're often a high target

140
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,080
um or

141
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,440
your executives for example or

142
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,719
privileged access users so

143
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,520
administrators in your

144
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,880
organization um but broadly you know i'd

145
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,599
recommend that you try to target

146
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,440
everybody

147
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,320
with phishing education awareness but

148
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,240
how deep you go might be dependent on

149
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,680
um you know how much funds you actually

150
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,000
have

151
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,880
so the second area is uh generic email

152
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,520
and education

153
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,000
page templates so often you'll um some

154
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,639
of the tools

155
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,080
out there the tools that you can use for

156
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:17,039
pushing simulations

157
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,758
uh there's also paid tools um and

158
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,280
they'll provide

159
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,440
you know a set of templates that you can

160
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,479
use but the key thing is

161
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,320
and i'll kind of touch on this a little

162
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:25,120
bit later the key thing is keeping that

163
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,840
information

164
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,039
and the look and feel of it fresh and

165
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,840
that's often a challenge for

166
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,320
organizations because

167
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,719
unlike myself in my previous role i had

168
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,000
a dedicated team around education and

169
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,479
awareness you may not have

170
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,520
that so you know having the time to

171
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,000
actually develop

172
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,280
you know fresh training every month or

173
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,800
whatever the frequency is that you

174
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,919
actually send your phishing simulations

175
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,479
out

176
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:52,320
can be quite a challenge the third area

177
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,758
is the education awareness team um

178
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,960
potentially in large larger

179
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,720
organizations where you've actually got

180
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,239
a team working on this

181
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,800
working in silos so it's really critical

182
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,039
to make sure that you've got integration

183
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,960
with other teams such as legal for

184
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,560
example

185
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,719
they may want to review their email

186
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,080
simulations before you send them out

187
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,360
um also especially around you know some

188
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,240
of the challenges that i've seen

189
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,240
copyright so people may want to use

190
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,840
logos of actual companies

191
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,600
that's generally i don't know unless

192
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,679
you've got their permission

193
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,039
um but also you know your internal

194
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,319
communications team if you're large

195
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:30,240
enough to have one of those

196
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:31,919
um they can be your best friend in

197
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,759
helping you understand

198
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,198
what other communications are coming out

199
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,280
at the same time

200
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,160
that may conflict um with the fishing

201
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,840
campaign that you're just about to run

202
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,600
and the final area is the lack of

203
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,880
measures so

204
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,600
it is hands down the top area that i get

205
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,440
asked about

206
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,880
um you know whenever i talk about this

207
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,360
topic is how do i

208
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,319
measure um the success of these

209
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,520
campaigns

210
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,440
and we're a little bit lucky with some

211
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,639
of the simulation um

212
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,000
tool sets in that we can

213
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,680
the tool sets there they give us a fair

214
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,319
bit of data so we can measure the

215
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,759
impacts

216
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,360
more easily than a lot of other

217
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,080
education and awareness campaigns that

218
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,759
you might run

219
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,599
but i'll touch on that a bit further

220
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:14,840
down in the presentation around metrics

221
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,080
and the types of metrics that there

222
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,400
are

223
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,758
so i'll hand over at this point to yanny

224
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,239
and she'll take us through the data and

225
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,880
machine learning side of things

226
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,400
thank you bianca so just talk about how

227
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,759
data and machine learning can play a

228
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,198
part in addressing some of those

229
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,319
challenges that bianca has just

230
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,880
mentioned about

231
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:35,199
so i would like to think about data and

232
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,680
machine learning as a supporting tool

233
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,360
to help us make better decisions you

234
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,599
know with more confidence

235
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,120
and when you want to improve let's say

236
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,560
efficient resilience

237
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,960
data can help you to develop

238
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,080
understanding about what is happening

239
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:51,198
in your organization and you could

240
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,520
uncover patterns

241
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,400
and make customized decisions for

242
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,919
example

243
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,239
like bianca has just said we could

244
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,198
understand you know behaviors of certain

245
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,039
user groups

246
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,240
and then we could show them customized

247
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,599
content such as

248
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,560
educational landing pages and data also

249
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,599
allows us to

250
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,520
you know better define and monitor

251
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,159
the progress and impact of our phishing

252
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,599
campaigns and it allows us to present

253
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,680
the right information to the right

254
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,000
audience so those are the things

255
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,599
that we will talk about today we will

256
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,080
walk you through some of the things we

257
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,240
have done

258
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,080
using data and machine learning in

259
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,440
shaping a cyber security education

260
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,639
program and at a higher level we also

261
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,880
wanted to discuss

262
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,799
some lessons learned about the role of

263
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,039
machine learning and data

264
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:39,199
including what they can and can't do for

265
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,880
you and what you can do to better

266
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,640
harness data and machine learning to

267
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,919
support your work

268
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,919
next slide please thank you

269
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,760
so let's start with some quick

270
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,760
background the results and lessons that

271
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,680
you're seeing in this presentation

272
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,600
are based on a collaboration between a

273
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,719
large insurance company and a team of

274
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,360
researchers

275
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:05,760
from unsw we started the collaboration

276
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,640
with a goal to develop a data inspired

277
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,640
approach

278
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,560
to improve fishing resilience within the

279
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,600
company and to shape the

280
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,040
education program and you might be

281
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,720
wondering what do we need for a

282
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,040
collaboration like this

283
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,160
so first of all we need data lots of

284
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,920
data

285
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:27,040
and in this project we mainly drew on

286
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,920
um the phishing campaign data but also

287
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,279
um contextual data which is actually

288
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,439
just domain knowledge

289
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,880
of the practitioners like bianca within

290
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:37,120
the organization

291
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,040
and we collect the contextual data

292
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:42,399
through interviews and

293
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:44,160
a lot of discussions so the image on the

294
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,800
right is a bit small but you should be

295
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,160
able to see

296
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,479
um that it's basically the life of a

297
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:53,439
data scientist and i found that really

298
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,200
relatable and very useful for me to walk

299
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,440
you through the process

300
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,959
so first of all um what i want to

301
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,000
emphasize is that

302
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,160
a lot of the data analytics projects

303
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,200
actually involve lots and lots of data

304
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,519
cleaning

305
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,680
and the building of machine learning

306
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:11,600
models may actually just be a small part

307
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:14,560
of such a project

308
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,440
so asking the right question actually

309
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,680
and

310
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,800
telling the right stories with the

311
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,439
outcomes

312
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,680
are much more important next slide

313
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,680
please

314
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,600
okay now that we have an understanding

315
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,479
on the overall process and what it

316
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,880
entails

317
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,240
let's just get to a real quick machine

318
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:36,240
learning 101

319
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,000
but before i start it is important to

320
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,880
note that um we did

321
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,920
a lot of descriptive analysis in this

322
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,680
project

323
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,760
in fact i would say the majority of our

324
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:48,800
analysis are descriptive and we'll talk

325
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:49,839
more about that later but we also

326
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,640
leveraged on

327
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,959
some predictive modeling to inform the

328
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:58,959
phishing campaign strategies

329
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:02,399
so the first step of predictive analysis

330
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:05,518
is really to go back to basic

331
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:08,240
and by this i mean asking

332
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,800
what is the problem so asking the right

333
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,279
question

334
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,279
is really important because it guides

335
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,320
every subsequent decision we are going

336
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,200
to make

337
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,279
for example what models we are going to

338
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,040
use and build and what results we can

339
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,920
get

340
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,640
so in the context of phishing campaigns

341
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,439
what we

342
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,160
found from this research project was

343
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,000
that

344
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,160
a majority of the questions we were

345
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,279
interested in were classification

346
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,360
problems

347
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,040
so classification problems are problems

348
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,760
that have discrete value

349
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:40,560
outcomes for example clicking on a

350
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:43,040
phishing email

351
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,839
or not clicking on one are discrete

352
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,719
outcomes

353
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,160
there is no middle ground where users

354
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,519
kind of click on the email but not

355
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,160
really

356
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,920
so we can teach computers to perform

357
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,360
classifications

358
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,319
and i think the process is kind of

359
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,720
similar to how we teach a child to

360
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,480
recognize maybe an animal that they have

361
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,360
not seen before

362
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,160
so let's say we show a child pictures of

363
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,839
cats

364
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,719
and we show them pictures of other

365
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,360
animals when they look at a cat picture

366
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,680
we'll say

367
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,800
cat and when they're looking at pictures

368
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,760
that aren't cats

369
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,599
who will say no and after a few rounds

370
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:23,360
the child will be able to classify

371
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,440
a new picture as a cat or not a cat

372
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,839
so this is a highly simplified example

373
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,480
of supervised learning

374
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,240
and there are a lot of ways to perform

375
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,320
classifications in machine learning i

376
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:37,279
will just quickly talk about two

377
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,160
models today the first is the decision

378
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,480
tree

379
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,319
and decision tree is something we are

380
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,320
quite familiar with because

381
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,440
we actually rely on it a lot when making

382
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,560
all sorts of decisions

383
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:51,680
every day so in the context of machine

384
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,000
learning what does the decision tree do

385
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,000
put it simply it helps you understand

386
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
the path of a decision

387
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,839
and then we also have a k-nearest

388
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,560
neighbors classifier here

389
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:04,320
um a not so simple name but actually

390
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:06,959
it's a very simple concept

391
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,720
so this algorithm assumes that similar

392
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,199
things are near to each other

393
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:12,160
as you can see from the diagram the

394
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,040
different colors

395
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:16,959
represents a sort of different clusters

396
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:19,199
classified as similar

397
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,000
so this classifier is very useful for

398
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,800
recommendation

399
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,160
systems and also um people use it to

400
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,279
identify

401
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,480
outliers such as unusual credit card

402
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,279
usage behaviors

403
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,200
and fraud so in addition to

404
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,079
classification there are also regression

405
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,079
problems

406
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,439
the output variable in the regression

407
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,760
problem is numerical

408
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:41,519
as opposed to discrete so regression

409
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:44,079
models is often used to predict

410
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:49,839
future prices and revenue for example

411
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:49,839
next please thank you

412
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,638
so in this project we settle for

413
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,720
decision tree models because

414
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,480
they are more intuitive and and we find

415
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,880
that they are much more helpful for

416
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:03,920
business users to actually use

417
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,880
so we use decision trees to identify

418
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,599
our features that have predictive power

419
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,360
for the

420
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,920
target variables that we are interested

421
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,480
in so what does that actually mean if we

422
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,719
look at the diagram in the slide

423
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,320
it's a simplified example but in this

424
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,000
case we can see that

425
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,399
the target variable that we are

426
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,440
interested in is whether the user has

427
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:25,760
clicked on the link

428
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,000
in a phishing email or not and the

429
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,760
answer is either yes or no so it is a

430
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,240
classification problem

431
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,880
and we want to know what features or

432
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,680
factors

433
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,680
can be used to predict if users will

434
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,719
click on a link or not

435
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:43,680
and in this tree you can see that

436
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:45,279
one of the first feature that was shown

437
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:48,399
as a predictor

438
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,519
is actually the using mobile feature and

439
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,680
we can see that

440
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,560
users are more likely to click on a

441
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,638
phishing email

442
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,239
if they were reading it from their

443
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,240
mobile device

444
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:59,279
and the next predictor is the contractor

445
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,240
feature

446
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,839
users with a role labeled as contractor

447
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,959
were more likely to click on phishing

448
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,279
emails

449
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,199
so these are very useful insights

450
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,320
because it can help us to make

451
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,599
better decisions for example we can make

452
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,680
sure that

453
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,440
our awareness training is being brought

454
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:19,920
out to contractors

455
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,639
and we can create educational pieces

456
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,719
that inform

457
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:25,120
employees about reading emails from

458
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:28,320
mobile devices

459
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:30,320
next so um but i also wanted to

460
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,600
emphasize that predictive models are not

461
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,000
going to guarantee

462
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,160
uh perfect decisions so there are many

463
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,040
challenges in doing predictive models

464
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,000
and uh one key challenge i want to talk

465
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,399
about today very

466
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,360
quickly is the requirement on data

467
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,880
quality

468
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:49,120
and requirement on data quality includes

469
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,720
the historical data that we need to

470
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,040
train the models

471
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,880
as well as the new data that we need to

472
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,920
make new decisions

473
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,639
so in when working with real-life data

474
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,959
sets

475
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,959
there's usually some missing value and

476
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,079
some mislabeled fields and all that in

477
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,399
the data set

478
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,638
and a very small variation in data can

479
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,759
actually change the decision tree

480
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,800
or produce a bias tree and this

481
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,600
challenges the trustworthiness of the

482
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,319
model

483
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,639
including the perceived trustworthiness

484
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,040
for the business users

485
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,480
so the key lesson we have learned from

486
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,199
these challenges

487
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,000
is the power of combining data machine

488
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,800
learning

489
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,839
and rich contextual understanding from

490
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,639
the insiders

491
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:36,639
in the organization to drive more

492
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:39,680
actionable insights

493
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:42,000
so for a researcher like myself i need

494
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:43,279
insights from you know practitioners who

495
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,519
are on the ground

496
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,800
to understand data points and understand

497
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,959
the results of it

498
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:51,120
so i'll pass it back to bianca to talk

499
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:54,880
about some of the insights that she has

500
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:59,199
related to the contextual understanding

501
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:02,639
sure so um so as yenni mentioned

502
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:05,520
we actually took two years of data

503
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,039
for this project and we did have a

504
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,119
number of those different problems you

505
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,839
know we had fields mislabeled

506
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:14,079
so i guess if you're going to go about

507
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:17,039
collecting or

508
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:18,879
undertaking a similar sort of project um

509
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,720
it's critical to make sure that number

510
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,120
one you've thought about when you first

511
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:25,039
set up the data that you've got the

512
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:26,799
right fields being captured

513
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,720
in the phishing simulation software for

514
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,679
example a lot of the tools allow you to

515
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,840
upload

516
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,000
uh various fields against each of the

517
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:37,039
users or you can bring that data

518
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,440
out and then match it up um with the

519
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,440
contextual information after uh the

520
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,120
simulations have been run

521
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,559
there are some challenges in doing that

522
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,918
for example people may leave in the

523
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,480
meantime and then

524
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,600
the the matching data that you have

525
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,760
later on

526
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,039
may not exist for that for that user

527
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:58,720
from the hr records for example

528
00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:01,039
so just a quick overview of why people

529
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,919
click so in the research that we've

530
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,080
undertaken

531
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:05,919
and the practices that we've run into

532
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,039
fishing simulations over a number of

533
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,039
years

534
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:10,160
we've identified there's a number of

535
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,840
different factors that you can see on

536
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,120
the screen here so i'll just go through

537
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:17,280
a couple of these um on the

538
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:19,760
brain side of things we've got the

539
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,639
cognitive biases so we've all got biases

540
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,559
that exist

541
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:28,080
um in our you know in our brains

542
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:30,080
and those are things that we

543
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,360
actually have to recognize and

544
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,799
understand

545
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,039
and should be incorporated into

546
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,280
education and awareness programs

547
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,120
to help people understand the types of

548
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,520
issues that can actually occur

549
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:44,080
because of their biases when they're say

550
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:47,679
reading a phishing email for example

551
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,439
so cognitive biases essentially guide

552
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,120
the way that you think

553
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,000
i've got a couple of examples here so

554
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,479
for example i've seen

555
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,400
over-confidence biases and not pointing

556
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,160
any fingers to it or

557
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,000
cyber people but they tend to be some

558
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,320
over-confidence biases

559
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,440
and that may be a false sense of um

560
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,960
skill or

561
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,840
self-belief that they're perhaps not

562
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,400
going to get caught out by a phishing

563
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,639
event

564
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,960
then we've got availability heuristic

565
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,880
and that one is essentially

566
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,640
you know performing actions based on

567
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,960
what we already know

568
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,160
and that for example you might make a

569
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,360
decision about opening

570
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,720
email based on related events a really

571
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,600
good example of that is when we

572
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,559
interviewed

573
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,080
one of the a few of the people that were

574
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,120
susceptible to a particular phishing

575
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,520
campaign

576
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:36,559
and it was a phishing campaign around

577
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:39,120
postage

578
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,080
and the message essentially uh was along

579
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,678
the lines of

580
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,360
you've missed a parcel being delivered

581
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,760
to your home

582
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,399
now uh that's a fairly common phishing

583
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,480
email

584
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,840
um you click on the link and it takes

585
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,440
you off to some site they'll grab your

586
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,799
details install software whatever it

587
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:54,799
does at the end

588
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,400
but um the issue with that was we sent

589
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,679
that out to say twelve and a half

590
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,080
thousand people

591
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,159
uh and we were pretty much taking the

592
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,320
approach that a lot of

593
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,000
hackers or social engineers take when

594
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,600
they send out phishing emails and that's

595
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,400
the spray and prayer

596
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:12,639
approach and that essentially means if i

597
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,000
send it out to a large enough target

598
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,159
audience

599
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
there's a likelihood that i'm at least

600
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,679
going to get some people to click on

601
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:21,919
those emails

602
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,280
and we did it was actually quite a

603
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:25,360
popular uh

604
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,039
phishing email to send out and when we

605
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,439
interviewed some of those people

606
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,559
we found out that actually they were

607
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:33,039
waiting at home

608
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,639
for a package at that point in time so

609
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:36,480
it was very relevant

610
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,240
to them and that comes over to the time

611
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,840
and timing side of things

612
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,360
is that the relevance really plays a

613
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,439
part in designing the

614
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,360
the fishing simulations and fishing camp

615
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,640
education campaigns

616
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:50,158
um so that was uh one example uh

617
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,200
the relationships that you have with

618
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:55,120
people is also a critical factor

619
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,039
and a lot of the you'll find that a lot

620
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,158
of the education and awareness campaigns

621
00:20:57,039 --> 00:21:00,640
tend to target the

622
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,159
technical uh factors or the technical

623
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,400
awareness for example

624
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,679
you know look at the sender's email

625
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,480
address address

626
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:09,679
and is that sender really the you know

627
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,880
do you know that person

628
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,200
is it really the person that you should

629
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:16,080
be expecting an email from for example

630
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:17,120
so they really focus on the design um

631
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,639
and the relationship

632
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,320
side of things but they may not take

633
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:22,000
into account these other elements around

634
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,039
the cognitive bias

635
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,960
um the curiosity one for example was a

636
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:29,200
really interesting one because

637
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,159
um we had people click on a particular

638
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,240
phishing uh

639
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:33,760
email and when we said to them why did

640
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,840
you click on that phishing email

641
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,360
um and it would have been you know they

642
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:39,520
had been a repeat offender

643
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,959
i don't like that word but that was the

644
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,000
the classification

645
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,600
so and their answer was oh i just wanted

646
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,960
to see what the education awareness

647
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,760
campaign looked like this week

648
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,400
this this month oh okay that's not

649
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,799
exactly what

650
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,799
we wanted you to do with phishing emails

651
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,799
um so there are errors that can

652
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,480
occur when you're actually designing um

653
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:01,440
these phishing campaigns

654
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:03,679
um in making sure that you're not too

655
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,919
enticing for people to be clicking on

656
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,880
on them as well regardless of whether

657
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:10,400
they think it's a

658
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:12,559
simulation or not um so

659
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,159
there's also other elements like risk

660
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,918
propensity and that's just ingrained

661
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:20,080
into people as well so how

662
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:22,480
um how likely are they to take risks

663
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:26,639
and that can increase the factor of

664
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:29,760
clicking on phishing emails for example

665
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:33,440
so some of the insights and improvements

666
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:35,440
um that we found through this program

667
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,799
was essentially as you're designing

668
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,840
these simulations

669
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:41,120
and education campaigns is treated like

670
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,918
a marketing campaign

671
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,280
so i put the example of norbert there so

672
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,120
in our campaign

673
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,879
we had a piece of software that piece of

674
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,080
software we could embed

675
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,400
a add-in into outlook and that outlook

676
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,320
add-in allowed people to quickly report

677
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:59,679
suspected phishing emails

678
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:02,799
um we created a character for that

679
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:03,520
icon and that's and he was a little fish

680
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:06,000
and he was a

681
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,280
fat little chubby purple fish and his

682
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
name was norbert

683
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,879
and then by the time we had implemented

684
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,480
the campaign

685
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,720
and gone through multiple iterations of

686
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,280
the simulations everybody knew about

687
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,440
norbert

688
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:22,399
even the uh ceo's pa the ceo himself

689
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,640
you know a lot of people really align

690
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,640
themselves to that marketing of

691
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,720
here's norbert click on norbert if you

692
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,000
see a suspected um phishing email

693
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,320
and it really raised up um i believe the

694
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,039
had an impact in contributing to the

695
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,840
reporting

696
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:40,000
statistics and the ability to be able to

697
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:43,199
avoid the real phishing emails

698
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,720
in the organization as well another

699
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,159
element is skill diversity in your

700
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,080
awareness team

701
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:52,320
so in our team you know we had

702
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,678
a graphic designer and animator who

703
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,039
would design that for those fresh

704
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,159
campaigns for us

705
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:59,919
we had a junior uh cyber security

706
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:03,760
specialist for example

707
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:05,919
um and a writer so um it's not always

708
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:07,679
you know really technical cyber security

709
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:09,120
people that may be involved in these

710
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,159
campaigns if you bring in that sort of

711
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,600
diversity

712
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,840
not only are you going to have diversity

713
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,199
of thought and innovation

714
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:18,639
around the types of campaigns that you

715
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:22,799
can use but also diversity around

716
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,679
um you know the types of initiatives

717
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,679
that you can take

718
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:26,960
how far you can extend your programs you

719
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,360
know if you've got those skill sets in

720
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,480
there

721
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,320
the sky's the limit right um

722
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,159
another one is innovation and refreshing

723
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:35,678
your branding so an element that we

724
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,159
worked on with the data set

725
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,600
was around developing a leaderboard to

726
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,320
assigning points to people

727
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:44,000
based on the successful phishing

728
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,559
simulation

729
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,480
submissions that they reported as well

730
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:50,639
as correlating that data with

731
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,760
real phishing reports as well so if they

732
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,919
recognize real

733
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:55,919
phishing emails being able to mash that

734
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,440
up and provide them points

735
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:59,200
put them on the leaderboard you know

736
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,480
have an annual price for it

737
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,240
etc um so defining the goal of each

738
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,720
communication is really important as

739
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,880
well

740
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,720
uh that just is best practice in terms

741
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,320
of making sure that you're really clear

742
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,760
about what it is that you want people to

743
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,480
do that call to action that i mentioned

744
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:16,400
at the start um

745
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,720
and i've talked to a number of people

746
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,600
around phishing simulations

747
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,080
and one of the elements uh that tends to

748
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,719
be

749
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,480
sort of thrown about is um sometimes

750
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,360
people go out with the initia with the

751
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,720
thinking of

752
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,158
we want to trick people into clicking we

753
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,919
want to get as many people as possible

754
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:34,159
clicking on this so that we can

755
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:35,279
and that's kind of not the goal of this

756
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,720
the goal is to

757
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,440
make sure that when a real phishing

758
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:41,120
email comes through they know what to do

759
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,039
they can recognize it and they can

760
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,199
report it through the right channels

761
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,320
so um you know hiding the fact that

762
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,640
you're going to send out a phishing

763
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,480
simulation isn't necessarily the best

764
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:52,480
um approach to to these types of

765
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,760
campaigns and that comes to the next

766
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,279
point around being transparent and

767
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,960
visible across the organization and

768
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,400
getting executive buy-in for your

769
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,799
program

770
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,400
um and then maybe jenny do you want to

771
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:05,039
touch on the data as insights to

772
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,039
stakeholders

773
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,600
so just quickly talk about um insights

774
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:12,159
around data so

775
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,840
i think one key thing we realized when

776
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:16,080
we worked on the project

777
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,279
was really about how educational

778
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,760
awareness team

779
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,640
usually would be the only unit in an

780
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,559
organization

781
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,760
shouldering you know the responsibility

782
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,000
of cultivating

783
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,919
the cyber resilience but when we have

784
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,480
data we can really make such

785
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,200
process really transparent and visible

786
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,240
and

787
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,880
just a small example in the project was

788
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,039
that we develop visualizations

789
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,240
and we customize it so we have different

790
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,240
dashboard views

791
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:44,640
um for different stakeholders from the

792
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:47,360
executive level to the operational level

793
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,799
so in that case it really shows um

794
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,399
different results and meaningful

795
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,279
outcomes that different stakeholders

796
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:54,000
wanted to see

797
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:55,440
it's over to you bianca yeah and and

798
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,279
that requires quite a bit of thought

799
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,039
behind it in terms of getting the right

800
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:01,120
metrics defined

801
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:03,039
for displaying to those right uh

802
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:05,279
stakeholder groups as well

803
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,799
so um you know the types of statistics

804
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,320
that you might report to the board

805
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,840
is not the types of the same types of

806
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,960
statistics or metrics that you're going

807
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:13,360
to report to

808
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,640
you know the um i i t or cyber

809
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:19,360
operational team for example

810
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,919
so that brings us on to metrics so

811
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,760
there's

812
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,600
essentially two different types of

813
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,240
metrics there's primary metrics and

814
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,840
secondary

815
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,279
metrics and i call the secondary metrics

816
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:30,879
vanity metrics

817
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:33,039
so the primary metrics essentially prove

818
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,159
that the user understands the education

819
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,960
content training

820
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,480
that you've delivered and it has moved

821
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,520
them towards an increased level of

822
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,080
understanding

823
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:42,799
so those metrics are the hardest metrics

824
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:46,480
to design

825
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:48,960
in any education and awareness program

826
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,799
because for example um you know it might

827
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,960
be quite hard to design

828
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,480
a metric that captures you know someone

829
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,640
attended a course

830
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,919
um how did they actually put that

831
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,760
knowledge into practice

832
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,480
okay you could give them a quiz for

833
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:04,000
example with phishing simulations

834
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,240
um what's the type of metric that you

835
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,799
might have there well it would be a

836
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,760
mash-up

837
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:11,760
um or a calculation of the and and the

838
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:13,520
trends that you can see in the data that

839
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:16,559
you've gathered over time

840
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:18,720
around you know fishing uh resilience

841
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,918
is going up so fishing resilience is a

842
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,399
measure of

843
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:25,360
um the number of people that report

844
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:28,158
versus the number of people that click

845
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,279
um and that'd be sort of a good primary

846
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:30,320
metric to have around a phishing

847
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:32,480
simulation

848
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,600
now secondary metrics are metrics that

849
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,760
are really easy

850
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:37,600
to come up with and they're the most

851
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,559
frequent metrics that i see being used

852
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,559
in programs

853
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:42,399
that they measure that an action has

854
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,440
been taken but it doesn't measure that

855
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,760
they've

856
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,720
consumed or put that knowledge into

857
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,200
practice

858
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,080
so a good example of a secondary metric

859
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,640
for

860
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:54,000
for example is you know website hits

861
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,159
someone visit a webpage

862
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,600
okay sure they visited it but did they

863
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,360
really

864
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,360
consume that knowledge did they just

865
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,158
click on the link have the page sitting

866
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,000
there

867
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,200
not actually read the content for

868
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,240
example how are you actually going to

869
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,880
measure

870
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:11,039
or get that primary metric that shows

871
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,559
that they've consumed that knowledge

872
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,600
so they're the two types of metrics that

873
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,520
you need to take into account now i'm

874
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,639
not saying secondary or venetian metrics

875
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,840
are really bad

876
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,200
um they're definitely uh supplement uh

877
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,799
what you have but the prime

878
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,320
primary metrics are definitely the ones

879
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,760
that you want to define

880
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,600
and then when you come to design your

881
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:29,039
dashboards and reporting around the data

882
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,480
that you've gathered

883
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,240
and the analysis that you've performed

884
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,360
say with machine learning or even manual

885
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,559
analysis if you don't have that

886
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,918
capability

887
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,600
um you know you've got to be able to

888
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:39,039
show those those primary metrics

889
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,799
otherwise you know you'll start getting

890
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:43,200
questions around well

891
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:46,639
you know what are we paying for here um

892
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,640
and should we continue to fund this

893
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:52,399
um so we we did say in the uh

894
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,880
the overview of this session that we'd

895
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:57,439
give a quick um and i want to leave some

896
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,200
some time for questions but we give a

897
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,679
quick you know lessons learned around

898
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,320
our

899
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,360
university and business collaboration um

900
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,760
so for

901
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:07,760
from a business perspective we found

902
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,960
that collaborating with the university

903
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,960
on this project

904
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,120
the benefits were fantastic the type of

905
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,440
knowledge that universities have

906
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,840
in terms of the research knowledge um

907
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,480
you generally can't find that uh inside

908
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:21,279
of a lot of

909
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,000
organizations so um that was a massive

910
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,559
benefit to

911
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:26,000
us but in establishing that type of

912
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,879
relationship you know things like the

913
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,679
contracts took

914
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:30,399
time to negotiate i think it took about

915
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,480
you know um

916
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,678
six months or more so you need to have

917
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,120
persistence

918
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:36,880
in developing these things if you work

919
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,479
for a large organization you collaborate

920
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,480
with the university on this type of

921
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,720
initiative

922
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,240
you will also have to negotiate and show

923
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,559
your lawyers or your legal team

924
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:48,320
internally that it's a reasonable

925
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,639
request to be sharing this ip

926
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,240
how are you going to secure the data if

927
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,320
it's shared with them

928
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,320
and we just came to compromises there in

929
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,720
terms of how that would work

930
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,320
also um making sure that we had an

931
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,080
executive sponsor engaged

932
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,158
who's interested i mean executive

933
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,918
sponsors for any type of project is just

934
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,399
you know you should be doing that that's

935
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,080
normal and then uh

936
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,360
you know if you're doing a research

937
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,799
project in collaboration with the

938
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,760
university you have to treat it like a

939
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,000
normal project

940
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:18,000
assign a project manager get smes

941
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,320
involved set up a schedule and a time

942
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,080
frame you know define all those things

943
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,360
and keep it going like a project and

944
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,918
sometimes that can be a challenge when

945
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,039
you've got

946
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,000
a bau work to undertake as well uh jenny

947
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:30,080
do you want to take us through some of

948
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,080
the university lessons

949
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,000
yeah sure so i'll be real quick because

950
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:36,158
we have two two minutes left

951
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,039
but from uh researchers or universities

952
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,880
perspective

953
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,080
again the collaboration is really a

954
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,080
rewarding one

955
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,918
but in terms of our lessons learned i

956
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,600
think i would just quickly highlight

957
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,840
two key points which i think are quite

958
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:49,519
important the first one i think bianca

959
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:52,720
briefly talked about it as well

960
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,000
so uh discuss about the expectations the

961
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,320
priorities and

962
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,519
how both parties actually see the

963
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:59,678
project so

964
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:00,799
what these projects means you know to

965
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:03,200
each party

966
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:04,240
that's very important because we wanted

967
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,480
to make sure that

968
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,679
the commitment the expected outcomes and

969
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,559
the timelines

970
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:11,279
are aligned so with an agreement

971
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,519
established

972
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:14,799
my second point would be about growing

973
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:16,720
the relationship

974
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:18,639
and i think this can be done in various

975
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:20,240
ways for example

976
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:22,000
regularly scheduled meetings is

977
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,799
definitely something we need to do

978
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,279
because

979
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,840
you don't want to miss any blind spots

980
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,360
or

981
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:30,000
you know you want to seek feedback

982
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:32,719
especially early feedback in the process

983
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,240
and try if possible involve key

984
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,000
stakeholders in the process

985
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,440
even though they might not be your

986
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,519
initial point of contact

987
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,200
because this is important to establish a

988
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,279
shared understanding

989
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,200
keep the momentum going and more

990
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:47,600
importantly i think is to keep the

991
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,960
key decision makers informed so they

992
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,199
might be the people who need to

993
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:53,200
implement the solution later

994
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,640
and beyond just that research

995
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,960
relationship it

996
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,279
we can actually grow it um in you know

997
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:01,279
different ways as well for example

998
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,320
um including each other in relevant

999
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:04,640
initiatives

1000
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,320
um in unsw for example we have

1001
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:08,559
educational programs that

1002
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:10,000
we connect practitioners with students

1003
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,918
so that's a good way to

1004
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,039
deliver more benefits to both parties in

1005
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,799
the collaboration

1006
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,640
and in companies maybe there's

1007
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,440
opportunities for the research team to

1008
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,519
come in

1009
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,679
to present their research or you know

1010
00:33:19,519 --> 00:33:24,000
present at webinars that are open to

1011
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,519
external audiences as well so to

1012
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,679
summarize i think always be

1013
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,519
proactive in growing the relationship

1014
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,080
and make it very mutually

1015
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:33,279
rewarding is the key so i think this

1016
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:36,320
brings us to the

1017
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:37,519
end of the presentation thank you so

1018
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:40,480
much for joining us

1019
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,120
and we're happy to take any questions

1020
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,640
yeah

1021
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:44,399
and if we don't get to everybody's

1022
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,640
questions uh during the session

1023
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:48,639
our emails are on the screen although

1024
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:50,320
the screen will stop sharing in a second

1025
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,760
uh but we've uploaded a copy of the

1026
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,240
slides and you can find our details at

1027
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,919
the

1028
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,360
at the end of that so the slides are in

1029
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,480
the general chat if you want to download

1030
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,840
those as well

1031
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,440
so we'll stop sharing now we'll see if

1032
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,399
there's any questions that anybody wants

1033
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,840
to

1034
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:07,330
um ask us oh wow there's lots of

1035
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:10,429
questions

1036
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:10,429
[Music]

1037
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:16,879
okay just having a quick look through

1038
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,239
just to see this

1039
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:22,159
so thank you everybody who said thank

1040
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:24,078
you a sample dashboard with you

1041
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,679
um if you send us an email we might be

1042
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:28,159
able to send you an example of what we

1043
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,159
did there

1044
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,918
okay just looking through

1045
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,960
i think i think it was mainly just

1046
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:48,638
comments that came through

1047
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:50,560
um but if i missed any any q a

1048
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:53,119
feel free to just re-enter it into the

1049
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:56,239
into the chat box i'm happy to

1050
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:58,720
uh oh here we go so q a so do you have a

1051
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:02,959
browser sandbox that you'll be recommend

1052
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:07,040
to test links in a safe environment um

1053
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:10,480
so usually uh if this is in regards to

1054
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,680
um testing phishing emails real phishing

1055
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,040
emails that might come through in your

1056
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:17,839
organization usually you'd build a

1057
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,560
completely sectioned off uh phishing

1058
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,200
environment

1059
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:21,920
uh or environment you can essentially

1060
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,520
detonate

1061
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:27,280
at the end in terms of a browser sandbox

1062
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,040
i don't know of any browser send boxes

1063
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:30,240
but in the past for example i've just

1064
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,839
used separate um

1065
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,680
you know virtual machines set up

1066
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:35,839
specifically for this purpose

1067
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,200
um where we'd go through and have it

1068
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:39,440
connected to us

1069
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,960
completely separate network connections

1070
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,599
that wasn't connected to

1071
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:44,240
our network in any way and that way

1072
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,599
there was

1073
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:50,879
no way it could sort of float outside of

1074
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:50,880
the virtualized environment

1075
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,359
what will be the proper information that

1076
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,880
should be in the security website for

1077
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:58,560
all staff keeping in mind the different

1078
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,040
levels of knowledge about security

1079
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,720
according to the role of each person

1080
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:07,040
um i think in the design of our

1081
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,720
program what we did for fishing

1082
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,440
simulations or fishing awareness for

1083
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,200
example is

1084
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,960
we've used the first 12 months of

1085
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,078
phishing simulations to design a

1086
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,599
baseline

1087
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,920
and get an understanding because like

1088
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,599
you said each not only will each

1089
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,359
individual have different knowledge but

1090
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:22,720
each organization will have different

1091
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:25,520
knowledge as well

1092
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:27,598
so um or sort of a different baseline in

1093
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,759
in their awareness around fishing

1094
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,000
so what we did is we used the first 12

1095
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:35,200
months to establish that baseline

1096
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:37,200
so for the first um sort of

1097
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,799
two months we did what we came up with a

1098
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,319
classification model for phishing

1099
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,320
emails and for the first two months we

1100
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,839
did easies and then we did mediums and

1101
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,520
then we did hard

1102
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,720
and then we repeated that process for

1103
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:48,000
the following six months just to

1104
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,759
validate what i think

1105
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,680
you know that we were baselining it

1106
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:53,680
correctly and what we the conclusion

1107
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,040
that we came to at the end of it was for

1108
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:57,359
example that

1109
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,759
our organization could pretty much

1110
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:01,759
understand easy and medium classified

1111
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,960
phishing emails but they we should

1112
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:05,440
really focus on

1113
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,680
hard classified and we came up with a

1114
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,640
methodology to define what easy medium

1115
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,279
and hard were

1116
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,480
so for example easy might have been um

1117
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,440
that you have

1118
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,920
um three visual indicators whether it be

1119
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,720
um

1120
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:21,200
you know misspelling or the logos all

1121
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,118
sort of squashing and skewer for example

1122
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,799
so we came up with different um

1123
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,240
different elements that defined what

1124
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,160
each classification model was

1125
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:30,160
i think so i think it's really important

1126
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,078
to define what the baseline is for your

1127
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,040
organization and get feedback from your

1128
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,839
people as well

1129
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,320
so for example in terms of the proper

1130
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:37,920
information

1131
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,839
when you design your security education

1132
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:42,000
awareness programs you should

1133
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:43,359
um you know develop content and then get

1134
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,800
feedback from all those different

1135
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,560
um you know different stakeholders in

1136
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,520
different business units as well is this

1137
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,839
too easy for you

1138
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,680
you know draft it one campaign that i've

1139
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:53,119
gone through before we we drafted

1140
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,640
everything up we thought it was fabulous

1141
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,480
you know all this sort of thing

1142
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:58,078
and then we found you know people hated

1143
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:00,880
it so

1144
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,480
you know um it's really important to get

1145
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,119
early feedback on whatever you're

1146
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,640
developing

1147
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,720
from different stakeholder business

1148
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:08,400
groups um to make sure that

1149
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,000
um i mean and you'll always get negative

1150
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,760
feedback about certain things

1151
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:17,040
but if the majority is positive then

1152
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:18,560
you know you know you're on a winner

1153
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,160
so yenni this one might be for you you

1154
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:21,520
mentioned you need lots of data

1155
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,359
how much data would you need for this

1156
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:25,280
kind of analysis would a phishing

1157
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:28,240
simulation as a service be able to use

1158
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:29,680
this and provide insights across clients

1159
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:32,000
well answer the question i just want to

1160
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,879
check if we still have time to

1161
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,880
answer the question

1162
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:47,839
oh i think you're going to chat later in

1163
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:47,839
uh in a separate room as well

1164
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,280
yeah audio issues

1165
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,880
okay maybe just go yeti and we'll get in

1166
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,320
as much as we can

1167
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:12,800
so i guess um in terms of oh no

1168
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:14,560
playing time time yeah so i think it's

1169
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,160
you want to find us on the floor or

1170
