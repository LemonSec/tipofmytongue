10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,680

27
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:54,320
straight up

28
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,800
if i see them i'll try and answer them

29
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,840
uh

30
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,239
let me just flick over great so anyway

31
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,680
hi

32
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,279
i'm simon stahn i'm a consultant for

33
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,199
adrenaline group um

34
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,799
i help diagnose and you know define

35
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,280
issues and problems in orgs from the

36
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,280
board down to the working project level

37
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,840
i also then usually get down and help

38
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,240
fix what we found inside the

39
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,960
organization

40
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,360
i focus on three different areas which

41
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,240
ultimately overlap and all make sense

42
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,119
to me at least the areas of information

43
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,399
identity and business intent

44
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,840
so i did have a co-presenter she was an

45
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,600
information management governance

46
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,280
specialist karen davey thought but

47
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,798
she couldn't unfortunately make it today

48
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,280
for personal reasons

49
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,880
so because we'd done some pre-recording

50
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,560
and cutting up of how we were going to

51
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,600
do the presentation i've had to just

52
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,079
re-jig it

53
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,280
um so please bear with me if uh you know

54
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,279
some things

55
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,200
don't quite flow as they should because

56
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,360
it has been a little last minute and

57
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,079
i can't do the governance piece in the

58
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:54,960
same way she can

59
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,759
so what's this talk all about well a lot

60
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,520
of this conference

61
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,040
you know quite rightly has focused on

62
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,640
cyber crime and protecting

63
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,719
you know against the likes of those

64
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,759
criminals and hackers and all of that

65
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,719
side of things and and

66
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,000
this is all good um it's also been about

67
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,799
minimizing and mitigating

68
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,280
cyber risk it's it's what we're here for

69
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,440
but

70
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,200
you know to me there are some other

71
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,760
things you know

72
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,079
if we think of heroes what do heroes do

73
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,920
now if i take my cue from comic books

74
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,120
none of which are so beautifully drawn

75
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,920
as mandy's

76
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:27,360
um you know they're either defending you

77
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,720
know they're heroes that defend

78
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,400
so secops um cert groups like i'll cert

79
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,760
all the different certs and intel groups

80
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,400
incident responders it's all in the

81
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:38,480
defense

82
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:40,959
you know category um or they're avenging

83
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,840
and those can be lawyers law enforcement

84
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,360
and police

85
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,959
as others have said don't go hacking

86
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,400
back but

87
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,800
it's that sort of side of things and

88
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,680
if we have the heroes you know to defend

89
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,000
or revenge

90
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,440
uh who do they go against what's against

91
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,800
foes

92
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,800
yeah and this is actually where i should

93
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,280
start using my whiteboard

94
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,760
now oh god

95
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,640
come on technical issues technical

96
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,640
demons be gone

97
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,120
now let me just check that you can see

98
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,680
yes hopefully you can see

99
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,200
everything there um you probably don't

100
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:23,760
need to see me

101
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,280
so bear with me while i

102
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,879
it is actually nice to see you though

103
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,120
simon

104
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,920
you want to see me okay let me just

105
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,040
put the picture and picture back on and

106
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,440
let me know if i draw

107
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,760
over it as in draw over myself

108
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:42,959
unfortunately i can't like fluro my face

109
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,959
but you know i can try

110
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:49,120
and if the pen come on

111
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,120
pen

112
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:58,000
love technical issues pen

113
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:01,840
that makes life a lot harder

114
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,840
i'm not typing this

115
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:15,840
that is not what we call a working

116
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,840
whiteboard

117
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,478
and it was working just in the demo

118
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,000
embarrassing

119
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,400
let me try and reset that

120
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,600
and give it a bit of charge in the

121
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,080
meantime i'll keep talking

122
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,840
so we have heroes to defend or avenge

123
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,639
you you know avenge for you against the

124
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,159
foes

125
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,680
now the foes we can have active

126
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,080
attackers you know the hackers the

127
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,240
nation

128
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,639
states all those types we've already

129
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,160
covered here at auscert quite a lot

130
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,720
you know there could be competitors

131
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,240
actually that you know are your foes but

132
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,840
actually you're probably better off you

133
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,680
know teaming up with them just like in

134
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,280
this community i mean people work for

135
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,199
different competitors

136
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,359
and yet you can all go out and have some

137
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,199
drinks have some chats and you know

138
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,800
formulate good strategies of dealing

139
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,600
with the proper foes as in

140
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,840
the active attackers and then we've you

141
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,600
know look at the uh

142
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,280
insiders and you know contemplate the

143
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,039
insider threat

144
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,400
but you know they're more of an active

145
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,919
attacker

146
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,799
and they're more based around your

147
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:22,080
active sorry your running systems

148
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,160
what about the projects you're trying to

149
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:27,840
get live you know where are the

150
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,840
who are the heroes and foes here

151
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,400
likewise excuse me

152
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,080
so let's step away from the heroes and

153
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,359
the foes for just a moment and look at

154
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,680
some context for

155
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,479
you know projects so as a consultant or

156
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,840
contractor

157
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,440
i'm usually brought in to address a

158
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,239
problem or figure out a way to get a

159
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,240
project delivered

160
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,600
no whiteboard um

161
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,479
yeah i'm just waiting on this little pen

162
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,240
to there it works

163
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,599
i do believe it ran out of capacitive

164
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,759
charge

165
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,120
because i was doing some demo work

166
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,840
before

167
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:08,000
so what i was going to look at your

168
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,960
heroes and your foes but

169
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,960
we're now moving down

170
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,198
and we'll get some context done

171
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,560
so so we step away from them for a

172
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,880
moment i'm a consultant

173
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,600
i come in i look at you know what is the

174
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,680
problem

175
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,800
how do we get it delivered you know

176
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,720
often projects

177
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,400
when i come into a place either as a

178
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,720
contractor you know brought in as an

179
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,440
internal resource as a consultant as an

180
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,440
outside

181
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,360
entity that's joining in to help you fix

182
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,039
something i get the thing

183
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,199
it's like oh the board has given us this

184
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,960
audit finding or you know we need more

185
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:42,000
of the cybers to be successful with this

186
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,840
project or

187
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,800
even our current cyber security vendors

188
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,479
are crap we need to do something

189
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,919
now none of these are actually a problem

190
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,599
statement they're all

191
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,599
symptoms of the problem you know they're

192
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:55,199
not the problem itself

193
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:56,960
um for this talk i'm actually going to

194
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,440
just ignore a few of the market drivers

195
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,039
like

196
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,880
vendors selling you more pro you know

197
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,400
more product because we can actually

198
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:04,880
handle that by defining requirements

199
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,039
more properly before you go to market

200
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,400
but in you know this current pandemic

201
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,919
situation

202
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:14,960
we can't ignore other drivers like time

203
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:17,198
budget resources and skill constraints

204
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,198
you know they're just all of them are

205
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,479
getting tighter as covert drags on and

206
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,080
on

207
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:23,919
and they're certainly not helping you

208
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,919
know get any security products

209
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:29,039
sorry security projects i know getting

210
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,318
actually delivered and operational

211
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,240
so there's two things we actually need

212
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,720
to ask ourselves to actually define a

213
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,880
problem

214
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,800
which you know those that problem

215
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,800
statement then becomes the input to a

216
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,280
running successful project

217
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,680
questions are what are we protecting and

218
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,119
why are we protecting it

219
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,960
so this is where i go back to my

220
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,560
whiteboard

221
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:53,280
what are we protecting and why

222
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,560
are we protecting it so these are the

223
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,719
two fundamental inputs

224
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,080
and this just provides a lot of context

225
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,560
so you know

226
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,199
i mean if you don't know these two

227
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,199
questions

228
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:04,960
about your project how can you actually

229
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,240
communicate that with a wider team or

230
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,560
how can you actually communicate that

231
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,599
with

232
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,000
your heroes how can you work

233
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,120
so at a high level what we're protecting

234
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,080
is usually defined as

235
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,080
the information assets you know that's a

236
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,758
nice quick throwaway infosec like oh we

237
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,680
protect the information assets

238
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,360
and the why is pretty much so the

239
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,960
business can keep on doing the business

240
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,639
that it keeps doing

241
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,318
but if you dig down a touch further and

242
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,759
try and get people to tell you exactly

243
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,640
what those info assets are

244
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,839
and you know who accesses them all the

245
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,519
other stuff

246
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,800
you just get the sound of crickets

247
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,799
there's just nothing

248
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,079
so but when you finally do get around to

249
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,159
knowing what the why

250
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,120
sorry the what and the where you know

251
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,920
you know how

252
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,279
each asset is useful how it's valued who

253
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,560
should be allowed access

254
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,560
you still need to the supporting

255
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,719
contextual why from the org so

256
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,239
why does that asset actually exist

257
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,080
because then you can actually decide if

258
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,600
this asset is something you need

259
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,519
something you need to keep enrich

260
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,399
protect and maybe even archive and

261
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,760
destroy

262
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,399
or actually are you better off without

263
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,519
it is it transient data that's doomed to

264
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,360
be forever stuck

265
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,959
in your systems basically there to

266
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,000
inflate some storage vendors

267
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,239
revenue quarterly revenues

268
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,120
you know but this is easy to just sort

269
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,600
of talk about

270
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,200
and scribble on a board but the reality

271
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,519
when you're dropped into a new project

272
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,959
how can you figure all this out you know

273
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,440
how do you get to the bottom of

274
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,359
the what and the why who can help us

275
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,880
with this huge task

276
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,560
you know this is not something we can do

277
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,600
alone we need some heroes

278
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,040
where are they hiding so

279
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,200
let me just scribble a few more things

280
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:44,160
on here that i just talked about

281
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,160
info assets now i'm out of the groove

282
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:51,839
of drawing

283
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:56,399
but what and the why

284
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,200
so why do these exist

285
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:09,600
right just checking the

286
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,240
not participants but the q a anyone got

287
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,040
anything

288
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,519
nope not yet needs more dragons thanks

289
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,640
mandy

290
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,399
i'll get to the dragons it takes me too

291
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,680
long to draw them

292
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,959
so recognize you've all your heroes are

293
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,439
all around us

294
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,359
recognize you need a team from multiple

295
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,720
disciplines you need to find and engage

296
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,920
and leverage these people with the

297
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,519
skills and knowledge of your

298
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,560
organization

299
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,399
because you'll find that they're the

300
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,839
ones that have what was often termed

301
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,440
organizational wisdom

302
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,040
they're the ones you know they know

303
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,040
where to go for things they know who

304
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,719
deals with what

305
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,480
if karen was here she'd actually take

306
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,440
you now through the dharma

307
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:51,120
denmark wheel and i will just flick over

308
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,120
so people can actually see it once

309
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,680
let me scroll this so if you go to

310
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:00,959
dharma.org

311
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:04,079
you will actually see this wheel now

312
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:06,239
from a data management perspective

313
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,920
they look at projects and they say you

314
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,959
need to cover all these areas

315
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,880
and you'll notice security

316
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:14,319
data security is just one of them

317
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,839
there's quality there's architecture

318
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,560
there's design there's modeling

319
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,160
there's all types of different pieces to

320
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,000
this puzzle

321
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,519
now a lot of people think they know

322
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,800
everything but when you start going

323
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,640
through this wheel

324
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,479
you actually think well actually i know

325
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,920
about all of that

326
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,680
but i'm not a data warehousing and

327
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,000
business intelligence specialist

328
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,120
so where can i find one in the org so

329
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,920
that's where that wheel

330
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,920
really does help

331
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,719
but you know looking for the roles you

332
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,399
know

333
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,560
which roles have the knowledge and the

334
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:49,200
information and let's just sort of stay

335
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:52,319
at the moment inside that ict sphere

336
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,200
ict security so we'll touch on some key

337
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,240
roles here

338
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,040
and i'm going to keep a very close eye

339
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,600
on the time

340
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,279
so we'll start with the architects so

341
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,160
there's plenty of different flavors and

342
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,439
these can be

343
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,639
i'll park these under heroes shall we

344
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,399
there are plenty different flavors of

345
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,000
architect in every organization and

346
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,200
everyone has different knowledge and

347
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,800
different experience

348
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,079
yeah and if you're lucky a lot of

349
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,519
architects have actually worn different

350
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,959
architecture caps

351
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,720
you know so they can actually point you

352
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,599
to other people and artifacts you didn't

353
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:25,600
even know existed in your orc

354
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,120
information architects

355
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,279
info architects they deal with data

356
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,399
models enterprise information models

357
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,200
business integration

358
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:34,000
content management and importantly they

359
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,160
should know

360
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,519
where the sources of truth are and by

361
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:40,480
that i mean the sources of truth for the

362
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,480
data and information

363
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,639
information security architects now i'm

364
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,839
sure we have a few people

365
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:51,360
in the audience here who are information

366
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,079
security architects

367
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,279
so where are they set what do they do

368
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,719
they sit between the information

369
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:59,839
architects really

370
00:12:56,720 --> 00:13:07,040
there and the security

371
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:09,920
and the privacy people

372
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,279
countdown timer okay sorry just seeing a

373
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,800
big flash up on my screen about a

374
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,639
countdown timer

375
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:15,839
um they said between the security and

376
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,600
the privacy people and they try and

377
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,480
ensure that the policies

378
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,839
you know the standards patterns

379
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,920
blueprints

380
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,920
just put standards blueprints

381
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,959
all of that stuff is adhered to and what

382
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,560
does this define

383
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,119
this defines some knowledge around the

384
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,119
info assets

385
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,320
you know these are also the information

386
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,600
security architects are also the people

387
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,440
you should probably go to

388
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,880
to start with anyway about regulatory

389
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,959
requirements on your data

390
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,800
data valuations classifications and

391
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,000
labeling schemes

392
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,599
they should be able to help you also

393
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,760
with the identity side of things let's

394
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,399
just change color

395
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,360
over here we have the information

396
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:57,519
architects

397
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:00,800
under the why we probably also want to

398
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,800
find out who is allowed

399
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,839
access

400
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,359
so these people should be able to talk

401
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,920
to you about that one

402
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:14,639
they should be able to talk to you about

403
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,639
put it here

404
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:18,959
regulatory requirements

405
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,719
so yeah the identity side note that the

406
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,240
information architect

407
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,079
information security architects should

408
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,360
probably also do some assurance work

409
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,079
so they can help you out there and

410
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:34,800
finding compliance bits and pieces

411
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:36,560
moving on the enterprise architects and

412
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,439
i'm not writing that word out full

413
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,560
because it's a whiteboard the enterprise

414
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,920
architects can wire

415
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,760
wear it very widely between

416
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,319
organizations they're meant to be on top

417
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:49,120
of

418
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:54,079
what in ea work that's a nice line

419
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:56,560
in ea work whiteboard's going crazy

420
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,839
they sit on top of the business the data

421
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,040
the application

422
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,519
the technology landscape okay

423
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,360
so whether they're fully on top of all

424
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:06,959
of that landscape or not

425
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,399
is up to you know after you've had a

426
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,760
chat you'll know

427
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,760
but they should know pretty much

428
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,560
everybody in the business from those who

429
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,720
understand

430
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,079
the business units you know to those

431
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,920
actually running the infrastructure and

432
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:20,399
importantly they'll know that non-iit

433
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,920
folk those out there doing things like

434
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,480
asset and fleet management

435
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:26,000
or you know dealing with scheduling with

436
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,959
actual clients or things like

437
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,639
that ideally they should be able to give

438
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:32,239
you a solid overview of the entire

439
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,360
business and its people including the

440
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,040
criticality

441
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,480
of each core area and their high level

442
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,240
business process

443
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,680
which actually brings me to another oft

444
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,079
underutilized discipline in a lot of

445
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,079
projects

446
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:45,839
these days which is the business analyst

447
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,839
or we just call them the ba

448
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,120
you know if you think about information

449
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,839
it's not just really a point in time

450
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,600
it's through the continuum of the

451
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:59,199
organization it doesn't magically appear

452
00:15:55,600 --> 00:16:01,040
it's created yeah granted if you have

453
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,040
some major security holes it may just

454
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,800
appear and it may just disappear but

455
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,639
looking at it from the way it should

456
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,359
work it should just

457
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:12,240
slowly build up it is created and it's

458
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:14,720
created as part of the business process

459
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,800
you know so if you look at the good old

460
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,839
consulting thing of people

461
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:25,040
they do process

462
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:28,639
the users technology or tools

463
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:31,759
process over there i'm going to use my

464
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:33,920
fluorescent lighter because it's cool

465
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,880
process is what is your business people

466
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,880
are things

467
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,199
do a process and i say things because

468
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,759
iot gets involved these days as well

469
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,120
so it creates reads uses or destroys

470
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,600
data and information

471
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,880
without that process a bit more

472
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,440
highlighting on it

473
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:50,240
there is no business okay a lot of

474
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,079
people think it's

475
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,320
the people in the business but the

476
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:58,000
people do the process

477
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,759
you know that combination alone

478
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,440
can be your business but typically

479
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,160
people use tools and tech

480
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,640
to actually do it update there simon

481
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,919
you're

482
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,919
right over the top of what you're

483
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:11,280
drawing everything down to the top of

484
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:11,280
process is covered by you

485
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,280
thanks that screen's a little bit hidden

486
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,079
from me otherwise i can't keep all my

487
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,639
things on

488
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:20,399
so yep thanks i'll just move that window

489
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:24,480
over a bit

490
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,480
good squeak that one a little bit

491
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,319
so they should know the business process

492
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,919
and importantly

493
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,159
they should know both the current and

494
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,200
the planned processes because if you go

495
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,640
off on a tangent

496
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,039
and the business is already doing some

497
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,559
processes or other projects

498
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,400
that go in different tangents you're

499
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,160
going to run into troubles so you can

500
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,960
work with them to understand information

501
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,240
creation

502
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,880
creation and usage within your project

503
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,799
so now you know you know where your

504
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,559
information is being created and used

505
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,559
and you probably have a good lead now on

506
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,160
who's actually doing you know those

507
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:58,639
people

508
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,360
in here those people what are they

509
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,000
actually

510
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,280
who who are they what are they doing

511
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,799
which brings us to the information in

512
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,320
cyber security people

513
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,240
you know it's their job to be on top of

514
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,520
the safety of the information in the

515
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,760
organization we're just going to hide

516
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,400
the people process tech thing

517
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,360
you know so these people here are very

518
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,559
much concerned

519
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,399
with the info assets you know including

520
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,960
well i'll draw them to the regulatory

521
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,960
one as well

522
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:28,639
so they're concerned about the safety of

523
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:31,039
this

524
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,799
so we now know what the information is

525
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,600
why it's come into existence

526
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,720
who creates and uses it and we know

527
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,480
probably just enough

528
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,440
you know dollar values actually we

529
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,640
should put valuation around here

530
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:47,200
what's the value of your data

531
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:48,559
you know is it worth keeping that's a

532
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,880
good question

533
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,000
so what the information is why it's come

534
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,720
into existence

535
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,520
who creates and uses it and you know we

536
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,960
know enough to

537
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,400
start to assess and protect it

538
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,919
so having the context around the

539
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,720
information actually lets us also do

540
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,679
nice things

541
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:06,559
on a sort of per data object or you know

542
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,200
information

543
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,600
set we look at it label it and classify

544
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,760
it

545
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:13,199
you know the privacy people they

546
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,039
definitely want to know

547
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,400
as much as they can about personal

548
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,760
information

549
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,440
because it's quite scary when you go

550
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,960
into an organization and you ask a few

551
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,559
key questions and you find out there's a

552
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,559
bunch of personal information which is

553
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,678
sitting in systems healthcare government

554
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,440
whatever systems

555
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,960
it's going along just fine but they take

556
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,720
a copy and put it into excel which sits

557
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,880
in their file folders

558
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,000
and it goes out on laptops and next to

559
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,600
that they've actually not just the

560
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,120
personal information but i've

561
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,120
just recently run into where all the

562
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,559
credit card numbers for the auto bill

563
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,799
and they know that's wrong and they know

564
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,600
pci but you know otherwise i can't do my

565
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,679
job

566
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,840
you know and especially in covered times

567
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,039
they can't do their job

568
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,600
they're going to get either fired or the

569
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:53,840
business doesn't get enough money in

570
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,360
but anyway so having this context won't

571
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,959
actually stop data getting lost

572
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,799
but it does help with defining ownership

573
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,559
and countability which is important

574
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,760
obviously to valuing the data you know

575
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,399
we know how critical it is to the

576
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,200
business

577
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,919
but also obtaining budgets these days to

578
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:09,679
actually go and protect it

579
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,520
you know and knowing these things early

580
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,799
on in your project's life

581
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,720
knowing everything about you can about

582
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,320
those info assets

583
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,919
is very important because the last thing

584
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,918
governance and insurance people want

585
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,039
when you get there during delivery are

586
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:23,200
actually surprises

587
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,520
nobody wants it so before you go and

588
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,559
talk to garments projects and all the

589
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,679
other teams

590
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,520
it's wise to actually have this

591
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,159
knowledge not only in your head but

592
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,158
documented

593
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,840
just keep your eye on

594
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:43,200
ppti yep ea good

595
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,559
b-a-e-a just looking down the um chat

596
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,120
list

597
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,840
yeah people process technology and info

598
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:51,280
assets

599
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:51,280
yep our classic one

600
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:56,159
so also working in any classified

601
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,960
environment

602
00:20:56,159 --> 00:21:00,480
you very much need to know uh what the

603
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,159
classification is all the data and how

604
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,679
it's changed there are also two factors

605
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,720
for those who are not that into the

606
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,559
security

607
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,919
valuation side which is aggregation and

608
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,158
association

609
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:13,039
if you have any data scientists who can

610
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,799
absolutely be heroes in your org

611
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,080
they will play with rather large data

612
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,760
sets and they will actually start cross

613
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,120
referencing between them

614
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,720
you know they can open up some great

615
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,918
opportunities for the business but

616
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,480
you've got to weigh that up against the

617
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,960
risks

618
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:26,400
on many different levels the only way to

619
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,880
truly impact assess

620
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,640
you know the data and the risks around

621
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,039
it is to know everything he can about

622
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:37,280
the context the what and the why

623
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:38,879
for everything let me skip on

624
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,039
so i'm skipping over some bits that

625
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:43,280
karen would normally do also keeping an

626
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:46,080
eye on time

627
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,360
how long do we have till 2 10 so we've

628
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,918
got 10 minutes

629
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,918
i can do it

630
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,000
yep camera's still up so i just had one

631
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,200
of my cameras beep at me for some

632
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,640
reason so i'm just checking i'm still on

633
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,559
yeah it's um important of information

634
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:09,360
ownership you can't own a risk

635
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,678
you can't you know sign it to somebody

636
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,080
and

637
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,360
thus get budget for it unless you

638
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,960
actually know who the owners are who's

639
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,520
accountable for it you can't just go

640
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,080
to the ceo it doesn't quite work like

641
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,918
that

642
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:22,000
ultimately yes there'll be somebody up

643
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,120
there cio cto

644
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,360
somebody who's gonna get their butt

645
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,158
kicked if you lose it it might probably

646
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,199
be you

647
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,640
but you might get swept out in that you

648
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,120
know thing

649
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:36,799
anyway we'll move on trying to quickly

650
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,879
get through this uh you'd also be wise

651
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,480
one of the cameras yeah just so you know

652
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,240
i can switch over

653
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:47,280
get a different one go that way

654
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,280
all right we'll stay there

655
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,240
we've already touched on the data

656
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,239
scientists who are looking for

657
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,919
information enlightenment

658
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,440
university researchers in certain

659
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:57,600
organizations in places you wouldn't

660
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,960
necessarily expect them like i work with

661
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,480
hospital bills where suddenly you

662
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,600
realize they're tied into universities

663
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,880
and you have the whole

664
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:06,320
edu nets that are coming in and video

665
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:08,799
streams going out

666
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,200
huge ways for data to come and go in

667
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:14,720
paths you didn't even know

668
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:18,240
um owners yep

669
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:19,840
so data scientists researchers

670
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,400
but also think about developers

671
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:24,799
developers often will take a large copy

672
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,600
of data because they need to play if

673
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,639
they're not

674
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,918
given like anonymized data that's

675
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:33,120
properly anonymized

676
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:35,200
different conversation different talk

677
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,879
you know they may accidentally leak it i

678
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,520
mean we all know about the s3 developer

679
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:41,039
buckets

680
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:43,520
that have been you know exposed recently

681
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:45,440
so you now know some of the parties

682
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,600
involved

683
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:50,240
you know there's going to be these now

684
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:53,520
i'll just note a couple of others that i

685
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:55,600
just spoke about the devs the data

686
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:58,720
scientists

687
00:23:55,600 --> 00:24:02,639
let's put data science sometimes

688
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:06,240
knowing your comms and pr people

689
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:09,039
is very important and

690
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,200
though and i don't think we have any in

691
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:12,879
the chat because the one i know has

692
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:18,000
bailed

693
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:19,520
but lawyers do we you do need to know

694
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,600
what lawyers are in your organization

695
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,918
and hr because

696
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:25,600
if you make changes to anything that

697
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:26,720
affects the users and that they have to

698
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,959
do differently

699
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,760
you could have unions involved you need

700
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,679
to retrain

701
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,360
people all these bits and pieces that

702
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:35,440
all has to go through hr and obviously

703
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,199
any training organizations

704
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:39,039
lawyers anything you do that goes in and

705
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,200
out of the organization

706
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:42,960
need to know about um especially on the

707
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,200
privacy side of things that's getting

708
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,000
more and more important these

709
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,480
conversations

710
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,679
take up probably a good quarter of the

711
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,240
time i spend

712
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,960
set up of a project just to talk about

713
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,240
privacy

714
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:58,799
and legalities of stuff and go

715
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,480
i'm not a lawyer go and find the one in

716
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:03,200
your organization or i can point you to

717
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,200
one to help

718
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,799
so anyway we'll move on from there

719
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,158
so how do you actually get on with this

720
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:14,639
now well

721
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,159
i heard this in i think it was jp's talk

722
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,120
just before

723
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:20,080
and i'm going to repeat it because it's

724
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,439
very important

725
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:26,879
and it was my first point as well high

726
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,159
level support and buy-in if you don't

727
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,120
have it

728
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,200
don't worry about the rest of the

729
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:34,559
project it's not gonna

730
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,640
not gonna succeed you just need that

731
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:39,279
high level buy-in

732
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:40,640
then you need to sit down with your

733
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:44,320
extended team

734
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:48,000
and manage to palm your whiteboard

735
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:50,559
and get your common goals

736
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,919
you know common goals sorted out but

737
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:54,799
importantly also

738
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:56,000
common goal clashes so if you've got

739
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,918
goals in your teams that

740
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,600
are pulling you in different directions

741
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,919
get them sorted beforehand it's

742
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,439
far easier to fix up front when you're

743
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,360
having nice discussions

744
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,559
than during delivery when it's all going

745
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,639
to pot

746
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:11,039
so any conflicts between the teams and

747
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,039
the projects and their goals

748
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,240
these things sort them out right at the

749
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:17,039
front do not move

750
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,400
past that step until a your high level

751
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:20,879
support is working well and

752
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,559
b you know everyone's involved and

753
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,159
everything's going nicely

754
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,559
and you're playing well in the same

755
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:29,760
sandpit

756
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:33,279
next to list out the action points i'll

757
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,279
put here and clashes

758
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,639
the actions needed

759
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:43,360
actions needed

760
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,960
versus the skills not kills that's a

761
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,600
gaming thing

762
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,919
skills which will also give you a good

763
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,520
direction in the skills gap

764
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,480
now here's a little one i drew up

765
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:56,320
earlier just to keep it pretty simple

766
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,000
you've got your actions needed across

767
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:01,039
the top drinking coffee

768
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,480
eating chocolate writing notes you got

769
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,400
mean you had karen

770
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:05,919
and as you can see we're both pretty

771
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,120
good at drinking coffee and eating

772
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,480
chocolate we're pretty

773
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,360
at sorry pretty bad at writing all the

774
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,320
documentation

775
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:15,600
so you know work it out beforehand and

776
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:18,240
make sure you get yourself flunky to

777
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,158
write all the documentation

778
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,840
don't do it on a whiteboard live like i

779
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:24,080
am

780
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,080
then

781
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:28,399
get your people engaged that did not

782
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,760
work

783
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:33,918
engaged yeah whatever

784
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,039
how start by finding the people you want

785
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:37,520
to engage with and

786
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:38,320
say hi you know explain you need their

787
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,960
knowledge

788
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:43,840
knowledge that only they have and with

789
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:45,760
everybody you engage with

790
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,799
start with how you mean to go on which

791
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,158
is honesty transparency and visibility

792
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:54,480
if you don't have those three right at

793
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,480
the start not much point going on

794
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,840
you also need a common repo

795
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:05,679
common repository oh man

796
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:09,520
repository it can be as simple as a wiki

797
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:11,840
or a table of contents right

798
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:13,440
so i've seen it quite a few times lots

799
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,080
of teams have their own repository they

800
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,919
have file folders they have sharepoints

801
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:20,000
they've got custom apps that publish

802
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,679
something but you need to ensure that

803
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,120
for your project and for everything that

804
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,960
hangs off it

805
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:26,399
everyone in there can get to everything

806
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,679
they need

807
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:30,879
and that could be sorry screen's just

808
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:33,279
flashed up i've got two minutes

809
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,440
remaining we'll get there

810
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:37,440
uh it could be as simple as a simple

811
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:39,039
wiki or a table of contents like a

812
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,240
single page that points off and

813
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,360
references in all the different

814
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:43,200
directions

815
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,559
you know so all the artifacts and output

816
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,919
from all the teams

817
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:49,760
you know can be accessible sometimes as

818
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:51,840
i say creating a basic wiki um

819
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:53,200
it's you basically you need one place to

820
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,080
start searching you need

821
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,240
because that's one place one two it's

822
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,080
one place you can start understanding

823
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,600
and it's one place to invite others into

824
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:04,720
the team bring new people in

825
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,320
as they join here start reading here and

826
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,200
it's also one place where they can then

827
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,840
add to and share their knowledge so

828
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,000
definitely do that one

829
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:17,279
however i'm gonna put this in big

830
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,320
no cloning we don't want the clone wars

831
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:20,240
happening

832
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,520
make sure that you're not duplicating or

833
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,679
cloning information

834
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,520
link to the source of the truth you know

835
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,080
where wherever you can you may need to

836
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,639
take

837
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,600
pdf copies of architecture diagrams or

838
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,600
something that's

839
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,719
live or you need a license but

840
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:34,240
realistically

841
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,159
you don't want to solve a knowledge

842
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,799
management issue by creating a data

843
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,720
management one

844
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:42,399
so that also leads to the point that

845
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:45,200
don't reinvent the wheel

846
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:48,080
if an artifact exists don't rewrite it

847
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,080
and recreate it

848
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,840
okay i'm not talking about github and

849
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,399
pushes though

850
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:57,760
um so don't rewrite it if necessary

851
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:59,678
because somebody's probably put a lot of

852
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:01,200
hard work in and organizational

853
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,720
knowledge has been poured into this

854
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,760
artifact and even if it looks a bit

855
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,120
dodgy to you

856
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,120
it's probably taken them a lot of hard

857
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,799
work and effort to get it that far

858
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,479
and get it into a repository of some

859
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:12,320
sort you know

860
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,480
the best way to get somebody offside is

861
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,840
to tell them their work's crap

862
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,679
though you're probably going to tell me

863
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,959
mine's crap now here in the chat so i'm

864
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:20,720
fine with that

865
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,880
remember at the end of the project there

866
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:27,120
should be a bunch of reusable assets

867
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:30,320
for the business to use so

868
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:33,600
here you've got

869
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:36,879
team this is the supporting structure

870
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:38,080
or scaffolding for your hero team so

871
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,559
just to recap you've got your

872
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:42,158
stakeholder buy-in you've got the people

873
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:45,520
you've got the common goals you've got

874
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:47,279
the skills you've got the action

875
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,879
you've got a common language you know

876
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:50,720
that you need to arrive at so

877
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:52,320
part of the documentation should always

878
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:53,520
be to make sure that the terms you're

879
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,559
referencing and all the other teams are

880
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,200
referencing

881
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,080
are the same terms many times halfway

882
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,519
through a project

883
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:02,080
i've discovered that teams are

884
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:04,399
referencing something by the same name

885
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,480
that is something completely different

886
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:08,158
and that will bite your project in the

887
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,600
backside

888
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:11,360
so you've got this common language and

889
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,840
you've got this repository

890
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,439
so now get your team of superheroes and

891
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,279
you've got your supporting structures

892
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,880
and you're ready to deliver just

893
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:20,320
remember to add a little bit extra

894
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,799
coffee and chocolate into the mix

895
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,799
you'll be good to go thanks

896
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:35,120
okay were there any questions

897
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:38,080
nothing in the official q a

898
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,439
i'm sure people have been asking

899
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,439
questions as they went and you seem to

900
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,200
have been following along

901
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,600
trying to follow along looking all over

902
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:48,799
the screen and trying to capture it it's

903
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,399
hard to draw and talk at the same time

904
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:52,240
well it worked quite well and um thank

905
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,918
you very much i i think everyone who was

906
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:55,600
here really appreciated it

907
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,360
and i'm sure they can either dump some

908
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:59,360
more questions in the uh

909
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,559
in the general chat or hit you up later

910
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,399
oh look someone is actually asked a

911
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:05,200
question

912
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:06,719
where's that one how do you modernize

913
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,000
the role of an enterprise architect to

914
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,000
make them more agile

915
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:14,080
oh that's a very good question to make

916
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,960
them more agile

917
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,840
so if you look at the ea's are often

918
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,000
accused of being in an

919
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,959
ivory tower sitting up and looking over

920
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,200
everything

921
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:25,360
so the problem you've got is they get

922
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,960
disassociated from the business

923
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,199
and the way to bring anyone who's being

924
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,519
disassociated is to bring them back in

925
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,000
so

926
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:33,919
part of this whole working team wise if

927
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,840
you want to work more agilely

928
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:37,200
bring them in start talking through

929
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,918
stuff you know

930
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,559
if if you've got people that are slow in

931
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:43,120
terms of

932
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:44,399
you know responding and cycling around

933
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,918
it doesn't matter whether they're

934
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:48,639
waterfall or agile

935
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:50,159
they're still going to be slow at it so

936
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,519
you need to work with those people use

937
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,720
your soft skills if you've

938
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:57,360
you know got some handy talk to them

939
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,799
see how you can actually get things done

940
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,439
part of your common goals will be the

941
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,120
time

942
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,840
you know the budgets and the constraints

943
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,518
you know we spoke about earlier

944
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,600
make sure that you work through those

945
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,320
with everyone so everyone's aware of

946
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,760
exactly what needs delivering by when

947
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,200
and then frankly

948
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:15,679
you should be able to leave them go to

949
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,840
do this pms will generally stand on to

950
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,559
stay on top of that as well i hope that

951
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,559
answers it a little bit

952
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,039
so my comment before simon is uh it

953
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:27,679
wasn't just about source code control

954
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:28,559
it was about everything whether it's

955
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:31,120
hidden behind your

956
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,399
enterprise document management system or

957
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,518
whatever it is you don't want to be

958
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,879
trying to manage all of your

959
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,519
documentation on a

960
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,240
flat drive where everyone does version

961
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:43,600
control by changing the file name

962
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,279
yep absolutely look the

963
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,199
the reality is that you go into any

964
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:50,480
place and they have

965
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:52,159
101 file folders 6 million i've been in

966
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,679
places that have literally millions of

967
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,919
excel spreadsheets

968
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:57,279
and then most of those are clones of

969
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:59,039
something else

970
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,480
and that's a completely different talk

971
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,440
that's more than just the information

972
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,760
space

973
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,799
but you know working through that to try

974
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,559
and say well

975
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,560
this is why we point off to the various

976
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,399
bits and pieces so we just get create a

977
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:12,799
series of references

978
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:14,078
and we don't go okay we'll take a copy

979
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,440
of all of that and put it in our own

980
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,119
file folder and then we'll create a

981
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,240
sharepoint which we're going to clone

982
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:21,040
all this into

983
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,359
no it should be a series of links or you

984
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,759
know

985
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,279
references out sometimes you'll need to

986
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,960
embed a couple of high-level images to

987
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,760
give somebody a good idea what they're

988
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,560
in for

989
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:32,000
but then reference them out and i see

990
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,960
what you've just described as part of

991
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,800
our job

992
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:37,679
doing enterprise information security

993
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,119
architecture and problem solving and

994
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,960
discovering and helping people through

995
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,200
their journey is to actually

996
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,079
highlight these issues and uh try and

997
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,359
bring them along

998
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:47,200
for the ride and help them do things the

999
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:50,319
right way and we're

1000
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:51,439
in security in security yeah in security

1001
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,079
as a whole

1002
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,800
we are in a unique place where we can

1003
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:57,040
actually

1004
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,560
like help all across the business

1005
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,000
because we're about the information

1006
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,440
assets we're about the business and

1007
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,839
securing the process

1008
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,200
helping the people and the tech so we we

1009
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,960
span everything

1010
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,359
so we should be able to talk to every

1011
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,040
one of those people we listed and i mean

1012
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,640
everyone from the developers the data

1013
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,359
scientists the legal and the comms

1014
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,240
people

1015
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:17,680
everybody in that sphere get through

1016
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,799
talk to them talk to them in their

1017
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:21,118
language

1018
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:23,520
and join it all up because that's what

1019
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,359
we in information security have the

1020
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,800
the lovely gift of being able to do is

1021
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,799
to talk to all of them

1022
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,000
and bring it all together and that's

1023
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:32,000
where you have your team of heroes

1024
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,280
to stay with the thing great thank you

1025
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,079
very much simon that was absolutely

1026
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,079
wonderful

1027
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,960
we just had one more come in oh yes how

1028
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:40,240
do you make the horse drink the water

1029
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,079
i think you just described that didn't

1030
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:46,240
you yeah sometimes yes there is the

1031
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,359
you know the horse the water they don't

1032
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,839
want to drink

1033
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:51,440
um some of that will often be down to

1034
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:53,040
organizational politics

1035
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,119
and that's something you need to get to

1036
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,440
the bottom of way early

1037
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,880
in your track that's part of that common

1038
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,079
goals and clashes because often the

1039
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,800
horse will pretend not to drink the

1040
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:03,280
water when you're

1041
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:04,320
standing there watching you know you

1042
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:07,599
leave

1043
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,960
sorry and some of that's clearly making

1044
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,800
them understand that the water

1045
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,160
is actually the vodka that they crave or

1046
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,160
whatever it is

1047
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:15,759
translating the terminology into what

1048
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:18,078
they actually understand

1049
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:19,040
yeah definitely put them through the um

1050
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,000
the fleek you know

1051
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:23,440
flea dip first before you bring them in

1052
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,640
so just looking at the comments there on

1053
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,560

1054
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,839

up to you really i usually try and use

1060
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,280
the carrot first and then i

1061
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,440
give the senior stakeholders the stick

1062
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:46,880
and say here okay they're not responding

1063
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,680
to the carrot maybe you should wave that

1064
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,680
around a bit

1065
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,440
um the projects where we have been the

1066
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,720
most successful in delivering are where

1067
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:54,480
my sponsors

1068
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,359
the high-level stakeholders have been at

1069
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:00,960
the sea level where i get the cfo

1070
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:04,480
or the coo to email out and say hugo

1071
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:06,640
um please work with this team of people

1072
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,480
to give them the answers they need and

1073
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:09,520
work with them this is important to the

1074
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,640
business

1075
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,720
and the business doesn't end their

1076
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:14,000
buying in like i said before if you

1077
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,279
don't have that high level buy-in it's

1078
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:19,520
time to go well

1079
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,720
until you do no point wasting more money

1080
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:22,000
and i think one of the things you

1081
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,078
described earlier is making sure

1082
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:26,160
everyone has that common language so

1083
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:27,440
defining the um the dictionary of terms

1084
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,319
and make sure everyone uses the same

1085
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,920
language

1086
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,920
