00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,000
good afternoon everyone and greetings

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,960
from western australia from perth

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,879
specifically where i am today and i'd

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,400
like to start off by acknowledging the

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,719
lands of the nomar

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,880
people on which we're meeting here in

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,840
perth and to which we're communicating

8
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,640
to you from

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,759
so greetings from the sunny west so my

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,519
name is martin dart

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,000
i'm the chief information security

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,278
officer for the wa health department

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,119
although i actually work for health

14
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,359
support services we are a

15
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,360
central shared service provider that the

16
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,680
wa health system uses

17
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,079
for a number of central technology and

18
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,480
also other support services

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,719
and i've put some links up here just

20
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,680
some icons of other organizations i've

21
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,840
worked in

22
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,960
commercial federal government here in

23
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,800
australia

24
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,079
and also the university sector as well

25
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,760
both here in australia

26
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:56,000
and back in the uk so this is my

27
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,120
second year in this position i'm

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,440
actually coming up to my second

29
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,480
anniversary in a couple of weeks

30
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,720
and for the rest of this presentation i

31
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,080
just want to talk you through

32
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,760
where we've come from what kind of

33
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,439
organization we are

34
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,159
and really how we're looking to move

35
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,679
forward into the future

36
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,439
not necessarily just based on our

37
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,119
current reaction the covid but hopefully

38
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,039
some more strategic

39
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:21,680
kind of approaches that we want to take

40
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,040
to the problems of security

41
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,200
and the challenge for us of course is

42
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,439
that this comes you know

43
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,960
as difficult as code it is for us it

44
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,639
comes on top of just our

45
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,520
bau overhead so this is a bit of an

46
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,520
overview

47
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,640
this is what wa health looks like in a

48
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,720
number of areas

49
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,320
both in technology so i've just

50
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,119
mentioned on here

51
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,919
we have a thousand software applications

52
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,880
2 000

53
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,479
servers we have an organization within

54
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,960
health support services of several

55
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,880
hundred people who support that

56
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,919
and that's just the one component of the

57
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,158
44 000 staff that the wa whole system

58
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,680
engages in all sorts of clinical and

59
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,119
support areas

60
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,799
and we're across one of the largest

61
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,560
geographies and i think we do

62
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,079
claim to be the largest physical

63
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,479
geography in the world

64
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:10,160
for any health department so we have

65
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,000
that problem not just of

66
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,560
you know normal scale of operations and

67
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
all the clinical things we have to do

68
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,760
but the places we have to do it the

69
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
places we have to get to

70
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,760
and the stretch we have to place on our

71
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
infrastructure and our resourcing to

72
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,120
make

73
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,160
that work in the sort of geography that

74
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:29,040
wa has

75
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,840
that's an ongoing challenge you can see

76
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,640
it's not cheap

77
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:34,160
the wa government now spends 10 billion

78
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,200
dollars a year just in health

79
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,720
health services so we are the largest

80
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,160
government department in western

81
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,640
australia we do employ the most people

82
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,840
we probably have the oldest technology

83
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,518
we probably have some of the newest

84
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,599
technology as well we do

85
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,760
have innovation and a great deal of that

86
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:55,119
goes on in the clinical space

87
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,120
and our doctors are very

88
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,760
keen to partner with research

89
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,359
organizations new vendors new

90
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,319
technologies

91
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,440
iot medical iot we have all of those

92
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:09,040
opportunities within the organization

93
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,560
but at the same time of course we are

94
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,640
trying to deliver

95
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,239
services we are a health department we

96
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,159
deal with a million emergency

97
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,680
presentations a year here in western

98
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,760
australia

99
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:23,519
25 000 births 86 000 surgeries

100
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,480
so in the middle of all of that legacy

101
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,400
management innovation management

102
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,560
paying all those people dealing with

103
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,599
people of course that are off sick and

104
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,120
go on holidays where they can

105
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,959
we also have to make sure that the

106
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,560
lights stay on and

107
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,319
as a shared service provider health

108
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,239
support services has that central

109
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,480
responsibility in effect

110
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,480
that we need to be able to surge where

111
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,640
we need to surge

112
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,798
we need to be able to bend and flex

113
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,040
where we need to bend and flex

114
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,159
and really we don't know a lot of the

115
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,239
time where that

116
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,239
demand and that requirement is coming

117
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,560
from and sometimes it just sneaks up on

118
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,920
us

119
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:05,439
and we go well we didn't see that coming

120
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,159
but we need to deal with it so it's not

121
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:09,840
an organization or an environment i

122
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,120
think for the faint-hearted i think

123
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,840
other people

124
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,879
maybe in this audience who work in

125
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:17,660
healthcare can recognize

126
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,798
their own organization in this type of

127
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:21,359
[Music]

128
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,560
contradictory sets of requirements you

129
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,320
know you never know who's going to be

130
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,360
knocking on the door next for

131
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:29,440
dealing with the next big thing

132
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,160
and just by way of illustrating that i

133
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,880
did a little experiment just last week

134
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,320
i fired up my little test instance of

135
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,759
multigo

136
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,080
and i thought look i'll just look at

137
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,880
some of our public-facing infrastructure

138
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,400
i'll see what

139
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,840
other people can see from the internet i

140
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,679
guess if you run this kind of scan

141
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,840
against this

142
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,280
so the little blue balls on here those

143
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,119
of you that are familiar with the tool

144
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,919
you recognize their kind of domains you

145
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,960
know the top

146
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:58,000
level name spaces within which

147
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,719
there are departments

148
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,639
or organizations or some subset of

149
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,240
infrastructure

150
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,919
so i've actually zoomed in really here

151
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,600
just on a small part of

152
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:10,000
what our network looks like i've

153
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,639
expanded a couple of the

154
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,600
top level domains and you start to see

155
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,520
that within

156
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,880
it's kind of a worlds within world type

157
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,080
scenario

158
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,719
there's infrastructure there's email

159
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,719
addresses and email infrastructure

160
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,800
within those domains and they have cross

161
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,240
relationships with other domains

162
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,080
and as you can see there's a number of

163
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:31,199
the blue spheres in here which i haven't

164
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,359
expanded

165
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,960
um because they just wouldn't fit on the

166
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,600
screen i mean just expanding these half

167
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,680
a dozen makes it kind of unreadable

168
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,720
but it's an indication of the type of

169
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,639
complexity and the type of

170
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:47,199
interrelatedness that we know we have to

171
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:50,479
deal with on a regular basis

172
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:53,600
and as i said earlier there is

173
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:55,199
some of these connections and some of

174
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,680
these domains will be

175
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,120
new and innovative and there will be

176
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,479
partnerships with commercial

177
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,319
organizations and research organizations

178
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,560
and some of them will just be dyed in

179
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,440
the wall bolted on rusted on legacy

180
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,280
stuff that hasn't changed in 20 years

181
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,560
and probably can't change in a hurry

182
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,559
because it's

183
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,240
underpinning or servicing a real

184
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,080
fundamental requirement of our

185
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,520
organization

186
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,960
and maybe the people who installed that

187
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,000
stuff and the people that kind of

188
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,159
configured it

189
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,120
are no longer around so we really have

190
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,759
to work

191
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,840
around and be very careful in dealing

192
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,199
with some of this infrastructure so

193
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,960
nothing is easy to change

194
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,039
i haven't said that of course you know

195
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,599
the organization looks at it well

196
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,280
yeah we still expect you as a chief

197
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,880
information security officer as a

198
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,758
central service provider

199
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,360
to take all of that complexity and just

200
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,280
kind of fix it you know give us some of

201
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,160
that good security stuff

202
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,080
we actually are doing a strategic uh

203
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,479
plan for ict at the moment within health

204
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,039
support services and there's a number of

205
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,960
projects listed and you know we look

206
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,080
into the innovation space and you say

207
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,680
yeah we're going to do medical

208
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,120
imaging differently there's a special

209
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,599
project for that

210
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:10,240
we know that our hr services and hr

211
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:12,319
systems are a legacy so we've got a

212
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:15,440
mitigation program and also an upgrade

213
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,960
path for those and that gets a specific

214
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:20,000
budget and it gets a number of people

215
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:22,560
working for it but then also on that

216
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,280
on that strategic plan for ict we just

217
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,560
see

218
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,239
information security and when i first

219
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,479
saw that i sort of said well

220
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,680
what's that is that gonna get some

221
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,400
special money or

222
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,400
or some special attention and the the

223
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,080
other executives just kind of said well

224
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,520
now we've spoken about it and we've

225
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,318
looked at the context of all these other

226
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,159
projects

227
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,440
and we just want them to be secure

228
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:46,240
please okay

229
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,680
and that's as far as they go in terms of

230
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,479
defining

231
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,720
what that needs to be but if you think

232
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,878
back to that previous slide

233
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,360
and also some of the services before

234
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:01,360
that which i explained it's like well

235
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:01,759
trying to apply just security for all

236
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,280
that

237
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:08,000
is pretty difficult so um that's

238
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,679
part of our everyday challenge and i

239
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,319
think this illustration of the rubik's

240
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,800
cube

241
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,240
um kind of encapsulates really what what

242
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,000
the

243
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,599
it's the challenge and the opportunity

244
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,879
if you can solve it it's gonna look

245
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:20,800
fantastic

246
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,319
but your chances of solving it as a

247
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,919
holistic puzzle

248
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,440
are pretty remote so you're gonna have

249
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,758
to look about or

250
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,560
how can you resolve bits of it you know

251
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,560
where do you need to focus in effect

252
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,919
now the traditional approach to this of

253
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:36,399
course is to do

254
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,760
something like this yeah we'll solve

255
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,240
your security problem

256
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,200
because we'll paint a bit of security

257
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,599
over here we'll

258
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,120
color that in we'll wallpaper over

259
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,040
something else

260
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,480
um you know we'll sweep some other stuff

261
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,040
under the carpet and it will kind of

262
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,440
look okay it'll look a bit like a solved

263
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:55,199
problem but whatever you do don't

264
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,200
scratch the surface

265
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,440
don't touch it it's still wet you know

266
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,160
you need to be delicate around it

267
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,360
and i think the days really where

268
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,040
security

269
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:08,000
could get away with that probably long

270
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,519
gone because we don't hold

271
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,440
the keys to the infrastructure anymore

272
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,959
when you did run the servers yourself

273
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,320
and you had your own data center you

274
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,279
kind of knew where the bodies were

275
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,120
buried and

276
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,800
you know you could work around it i

277
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,839
think now where there's much more of an

278
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,000
environment of partnerships cloud

279
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,959
services

280
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,880
and certainly a huge amount more demand

281
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,680
from the organization

282
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:32,640
uh you've really got to come up with

283
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,160
substantive and long-term solutions

284
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,920
but that's not to say that as an

285
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,959
organization we don't have a lot going

286
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,880
on you know we've got

287
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,160
in-flight programs and i've just picked

288
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,760
a few here as a kind of an example

289
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,439
of course we're doing the migration to

290
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,200
cloud you know but everyone's doing a

291
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,120
migration to cloud this isn't

292
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,399
new or innovative really in any

293
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,399
substantial sense

294
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,399
we do it that's a scale maybe that's

295
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:57,040
different from other people

296
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,600
but um you know you've all done it so

297
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,800
you

298
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,120
you're aware of the problems and the

299
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,719
challenges that that presents

300
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:05,279
digital transformation is kind of a

301
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,480
buzzword um we're as guilty of it as

302
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,399
anybody else we

303
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,959
want to do different things with our

304
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,200
data we want to deliver our services

305
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,160
differently over different platforms to

306
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:18,000
people

307
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,760
so that's nice but um again

308
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,600
lots of people are doing that it's it's

309
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,600
not difficult to do

310
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,200
it's not difficult to find people to to

311
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,120
work with you in the marketplace to do

312
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,120
those sorts of things

313
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,320
and of course we're doing really just

314
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,480
like everybody else across the whole

315
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,000
country we've had to do a covig response

316
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,839
we've had to do work from home over the

317
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,279
last six months

318
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,959
uh it was certainly a stressful

319
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:41,519
experience to

320
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,199
ramp that up quickly we had to send

321
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,120
several thousand people

322
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,120
to work from windows virtual desktops

323
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,279
from home we had to ramp up the

324
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,880
licensing of course on our vpn

325
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:55,360
connections and procure a number of

326
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,200
laptops in fact we got a preferential

327
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,040
hardware procurement agreement within

328
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,640
the state of western australia from

329
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,880
the hardware suppliers from the supply

330
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,399
chain to actually get us the laptops

331
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,760
that we needed as part of that covered

332
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,079
response

333
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,959
but again not unusual that same

334
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,599
experience

335
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,199
that same reaction has been experienced

336
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,279
by a number of people

337
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,440
and maybe some people have done it

338
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:20,079
better or they've done it differently

339
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,000
but uh it's not i think a unique enough

340
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,560
experience maybe to talk about today

341
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,839
because

342
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,760
you will hear about that from other

343
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,880
people within different

344
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:31,040
organizational contexts as well

345
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,399
which of course does lead us to the

346
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:36,160
question

347
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:38,079
so what is new what is wa health doing

348
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,680
how has it changed its approach to kind

349
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,800
of solve some of its fundamental

350
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,640
problems

351
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,560
that's what we'll have a little look at

352
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,120
moving forwards

353
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,560
and if i had to sum that up in one word

354
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,920
i think i probably would pick

355
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:54,880
the word attitude i think it's the

356
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,360
approach and i don't mean attitude in

357
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,040
you know

358
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,399
a kind of negative or an aggressive

359
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,560
sense of

360
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,160
having a bad attitude or an aggressive

361
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,079
attitude

362
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,439
i think your attitude though your

363
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:08,560
approach to the way

364
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,320
you deal with that complexity you deal

365
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,160
with the frustration and you deal with

366
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,200
the challenges that come

367
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,240
from an organization like wa health

368
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:21,519
which certainly can be infuriating

369
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,440
hugely intimidating and just

370
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,880
you know you don't know whether to laugh

371
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,480
or cry sometimes

372
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,880
you have to have an attitude that can

373
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:32,399
deal with all of those frustrations

374
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:33,680
and all of those problems um we do

375
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,760
see people that come into the

376
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,959
organization they find that such a

377
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,439
challenge

378
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,479
and they can't adjust to that way of

379
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,160
working

380
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,480
that they tend not to stay around very

381
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:46,319
long and that's fine i mean if you don't

382
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,560
have a personality

383
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,320
that can deal with that then you're just

384
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,839
going to have a miserable time at work

385
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:55,200
so there is an attitude adjustment that

386
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,600
takes place when you come into an

387
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,959
organization that's this big

388
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:03,279
this fragmented in an operational sense

389
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:05,279
and particularly wa across such a large

390
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:06,959
geographical area

391
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,800
you've got to recognize you're not going

392
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,760
to be at the center of every meeting

393
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,040
and every decision and every design

394
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,720
other people are going to be doing

395
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,120
things all the time that

396
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,040
you have no visibility of until they go

397
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,480
live or they go wrong and then they come

398
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:23,760
knocking on your door

399
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,279
and say yep we've made a mistake we need

400
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,360
you to help us out

401
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:29,120
you have to have an attitude of

402
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,480
welcoming those people in and welcoming

403
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,000
their engagement

404
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:34,320
even though it comes at a time that

405
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,800
perhaps is not as optimal to you as

406
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,680
you kind of would have preferred so i'm

407
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,279
really

408
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:41,040
started to think about this really for

409
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,959
the first time for this presentation and

410
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,519
i think i've kind of arrived at

411
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:48,000
three types of approach that have served

412
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,320
me well in trying to understand

413
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,680
and just ride the waves of this

414
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,240
organization in its

415
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,399
all of its scale and complexity these

416
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,000
are three approaches that i think now i

417
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:02,240
try to explain to other people

418
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
which are non-technical approaches

419
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,959
really approach number one here for

420
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,360
example

421
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,160
the organization had commenced on a

422
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,120
pretty

423
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,199
large commitment cloud when i started

424
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,399
work here so we're in the next 10 years

425
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,639
looking to

426
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,720
spend 100 million dollars in terms of

427
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,519
cloud application migrations and

428
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,720
infrastructure

429
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,639
migrations onto cloud platforms

430
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,800
so there was very much a belief again

431
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,560
that you know well cloud is the default

432
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,800
everything can go into cloud

433
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,920
and very early on i wanted to kind of

434
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,920
build the

435
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,399
attitude that not all clouds are the

436
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,839
same not all clouds are secure

437
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,199
and we need to treat them in different

438
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,360
ways depending on the type of

439
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,519
information that we want to share

440
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,160
so my first point here i started to

441
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,440
draft a cloud risk policy really as soon

442
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,839
as i arrived in the role

443
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,600
and that iteration and that drafting

444
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,079
went on for about 18 months between

445
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,000
myself

446
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,319
and the department of health who issue

447
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,480
policy across the state

448
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,560
and you know there was the usual kind of

449
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,000
bureaucratic doing and throwing about

450
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,239
formats and

451
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,440
legal approvals and all that kind of

452
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,360
stuff

453
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:09,680
what really forced the issue was you

454
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,880
know last month

455
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:15,599
a media organization

456
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,399
identified and brought to our attention

457
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,519
a

458
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,920
data breach so we had a system that was

459
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,560
sending information out really too much

460
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,680
information that should have been sent

461
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,599
now that of course creates an

462
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,359
environment where the executive of the

463
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,040
organization comes together

464
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,880
and they start to ask questions about

465
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,839
what's gone wrong here

466
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,680
how do we fix it and systemically what

467
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:40,639
more do we need to do

468
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,680
so when i was in that role in that in

469
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,279
that room for the

470
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,800
for the first time really i kind of

471
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,639
stuck my hands up and i said

472
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,160
look we've been trying to change this

473
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,600
culture

474
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,680
sorry i should have said that the data

475
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,720
breach was facilitated through a

476
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,920
third-party cloud messaging service you

477
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,920
know a subscription that had been around

478
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,759
for a long time

479
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,360
again i stuck my hand up and said to the

480
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,959
director general of health look we've

481
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,800
been working on this problem for the

482
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,920
last couple of years i recognized early

483
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,479
on that it's

484
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:10,880
a cultural and a behavioral challenge

485
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,320
that the organization has

486
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,680
people stick things in clouds and then

487
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,040
don't think about them again they don't

488
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,040
revisit the contract

489
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:18,719
they don't consider the risk whether it

490
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:22,160
changes or not

491
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:24,480
so i said look we've got the policy

492
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,920
if we release the policy part of that

493
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:28,800
requirement is that we start to

494
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:31,759
establish a register of cloud services

495
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,519
all new cloud services have to be lodged

496
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,759
into that register through my department

497
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,639
so we get visibility of where people are

498
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,120
putting things

499
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,000
and we ask them to address simple

500
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,560
questions

501
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:44,480
who is authorizing this data to go here

502
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,680
what classification does the data have

503
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,959
does it have special handling

504
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,959
requirements

505
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,800
and if that cloud service is unavailable

506
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,319
for whatever reason

507
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,800
how will you continue business is there

508
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:56,959
a bcp plan in effect

509
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:59,599
now within seven to two hours of the

510
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:02,079
data breach that cloud policy went live

511
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,440
so we now have that this was a month six

512
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:06,559
weeks ago

513
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,079
so this cuts across the independent

514
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,599
agencies that make up

515
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:11,198
quasi-independent agencies that make up

516
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,280
the health service you know

517
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:15,919
each of the uh we call them health

518
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:17,599
service providers has their own board

519
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,679
so they have their own risk assessments

520
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,039
and some of them have their own policies

521
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:23,199
this is a policy that applies to

522
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,559
everyone at the top of the department

523
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,600
down so it's really useful for us

524
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:31,039
to have this as a bit of a baseline it

525
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,240
helps us understand how people are using

526
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,559
cloud

527
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,720
the second part is really about cloud as

528
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,918
part of that platform as a service

529
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,840
security infrastructure security

530
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:43,280
management as a service that now we

531
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,080
typically get from cloud

532
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:48,080
vendors you know we don't run really

533
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,918
many in-house boxes and we don't buy

534
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,600
devices that sit on your network and do

535
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:54,320
much monitoring

536
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,199
all of these are now available as cloud

537
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,039
but what

538
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:59,200
we found and i get lots of approaches

539
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,720
and still do from a vendor that sells

540
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,960
you one product that says oh we've got

541
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,799
an

542
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,240
add-on and we can do something else and

543
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,000
then something else

544
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,280
and we can in fact be your vendor of

545
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,720
choice you know you don't need to go to

546
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,480
anybody else

547
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,000
i think i've arrived at an approach now

548
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,440
my attitude is i don't think that's

549
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,039
particularly healthy

550
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,400
or i think what we need to do is

551
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,280
challenge those assumptions from the

552
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,880
vendors

553
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,639
because what we see is a vendor that can

554
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,799
do one thing really well

555
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,200
who then procures a technology or buys

556
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,280
into a partnership with another vendor

557
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,360
may not do that second thing in the same

558
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,440
way they did the first

559
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,120
so as i've pointed out in the example

560
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,640
here maybe the people that provide you

561
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,799
your enterprise collaboration

562
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:39,679
service should they be the people that

563
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:41,679
also provide you with your seam service

564
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,960
and your email protection and your dlp

565
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,880
and your casbi

566
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,400
because when you think about it the

567
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,320
vendor that's running your email

568
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:51,280
verification service if they're also

569
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,559
selling you the email service itself are

570
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,280
they really going to tell you that their

571
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,600
own service

572
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,160
really is sub-optimal sometimes i think

573
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,159
it's useful to have that little bit of

574
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,520
friction that occurs when you have

575
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,960
different vendors and you know one

576
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,720
vendor is of course looking over the

577
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,160
other vendor's shoulder

578
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,919
because from their perspective they're

579
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,720
thinking is there a business opportunity

580
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:11,039
you know can i

581
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,720
can i get in here if i can disprove the

582
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:15,120
other vendor as being effective

583
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,960
so i think using that in a constructive

584
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,320
way and really asking the questions

585
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:20,080
about you know are we

586
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,000
do we have the right vendor do we have

587
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,199
the best of breed to meet what the

588
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,640
business outcome

589
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,640
or the security outcome that we're

590
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,000
trying to achieve

591
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,559
and i do find in some of the

592
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,799
consolidated platforms from from one

593
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:34,399
vendor trying to do multiple things

594
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:35,840
they sort of call it one product suite

595
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:39,039
but you do tend to get different

596
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:41,199
dashboards and different screens and

597
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,240
it can be hard to get the consolidated

598
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,080
view

599
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,520
which i sort of ask you know at my level

600
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,720
i sort of go well look what's going on

601
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,080
and what does it mean

602
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,400
you know just give me that picture give

603
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:52,000
me that that one slide or that one

604
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,840
diagram that illustrates that because

605
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,919
then i can take that to the executive

606
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,039
and you know make a business case for

607
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,919
changing things

608
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,320
so that can be a bit of a challenge so

609
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,080
this

610
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:04,158
second approach here is really about

611
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,480
trying to understand the environment

612
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,760
and really consider what information we

613
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,039
can infer about

614
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,280
really what we're seeing from a number

615
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:13,440
of sources so again this isn't

616
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,480
a particularly new concept some of you

617
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,400
will recognize

618
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,880
this concept of observe orient decide

619
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,200
and act

620
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,200
also known as an ooda loop also

621
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,120
sometimes called a boy loop

622
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,320
by the person who identified that john

623
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:31,199
boyd back in the korean war so

624
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,158
again not a new concept but really it's

625
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,120
about

626
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:37,120
a process you know the four stages of

627
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,158
this that you really need to be able to

628
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,239
complete to be able to go from that

629
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,400
process of you know seeing something

630
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,840
understanding the concept looking at

631
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,039
your options

632
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,120
and then really doing something

633
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,720
meaningful and there's a bit more of a

634
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,280
detailed description of it on the screen

635
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
there which

636
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,399
you know certainly won't go into all the

637
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:56,000
processes of that

638
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:57,760
but it's about going through each stage

639
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,360
and then providing a feedback going well

640
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:02,879
do i need to observe more

641
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:05,039
can i proceed to acting once i've acted

642
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,080
can i through the feedback loop observe

643
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,320
that the action has

644
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,000
actually made an impact so we do this in

645
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,320
a number of areas or we're starting to

646
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,600
improve this maturity

647
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,720
so some of the questions we ask

648
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:18,480
ourselves what are we seeing via email

649
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:20,559
versus what we see on the remote access

650
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:22,320
logs

651
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:24,240
if we don't see anything there but we're

652
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,399
seeing something perhaps that's a large

653
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,520
amount of data being moved from our

654
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:31,600
cloud instance

655
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:33,200
to a workstation or another location

656
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,959
maybe that's an indication telling us

657
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,880
something that you know the email logs

658
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,120
and the remote access logs haven't

659
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,799
so you need to have multiple kind of

660
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:42,158
channels to look at this type of

661
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,639
information

662
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,640
we also then you know try to look and

663
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,400
try to infer information from our

664
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,280
patch levels and vulnerability

665
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:52,880
management threat intelligence feed

666
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:54,320
and open source data breach

667
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,080
notifications because that

668
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,600
at the end of the day may be the one

669
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,000
kind of indicator that we have a problem

670
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,399
that

671
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
nothing else has told us about from the

672
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,960
business perspective of course they're

673
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,280
concerned about

674
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,400
well is there something that needs to be

675
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,918
escalated

676
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,679
do we have more risk this month than we

677
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,520
had last month

678
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,440
you know who do we need to alert who do

679
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,200
we need to contact

680
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,799
um so i'll show you in the next slide

681
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,400
something really that's just one little

682
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,600
example of that

683
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:23,440
so here's an example of really what that

684
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,760
looks like operationally for us

685
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,360
so this is a platform we've had for

686
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,520
several months now

687
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,039
and we've certainly come to rely on this

688
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,559
throughout our covid period

689
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:34,158
particularly because you know we saw a

690
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,879
lot more email-borne

691
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:38,640
threats throughout that period but this

692
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,159
gives us an indication just of

693
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,960
two months so july versus august

694
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,799
in august we saw you know a fair bit

695
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,480
more email another half a million more

696
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,080
emails potentially coming into our

697
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:53,360
organization

698
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:56,320
but we delivered fewer of them

699
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,399
um and it's only looking at the sort of

700
00:22:56,320 --> 00:23:01,439
threat profile that sits between those

701
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:03,360
two statistics that we start to look at

702
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,880
yeah we've got double the amount of url

703
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:07,039
threats that came in in that second

704
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:10,720
month versus the first month

705
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:12,960
three times more ip reputational threats

706
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:16,159
and we can probably infer that you know

707
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:17,840
email is a channel that's experiencing

708
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,240
a challenge at the moment you know there

709
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,320
is more campaign activity there might be

710
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,400
more targeted activity

711
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:25,840
and through this platform we can also

712
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,360
start to look at

713
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:29,120
who are the people that were attacked

714
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:32,320
the most you know we call them

715
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,760
our very attacked people and we notice

716
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,600
that that changes month to month

717
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,200
sometimes it's clinical people sometimes

718
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,879
it's admin support people

719
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,480
you know why is that is there anything

720
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,400
that's happening

721
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:44,240
in terms of the organizational activity

722
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:47,440
that supports

723
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,960
that kind of analysis

724
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,559
and what it gives us an indication of

725
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:53,760
although we don't have the precise

726
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:56,320
nature of you know what's gone on

727
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,520
uh with that extra half a million kind

728
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,039
of emails

729
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,039
what we do know is that something

730
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:03,440
strange is is going on so we'll start to

731
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:06,000
look for other indicators in other areas

732
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:07,440
to verify that information and the

733
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
little quotes at the bottom just made me

734
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,000
realize

735
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,600
maybe shakespeare was the world's first

736
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,039
cyber analyst

737
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,719
sometimes you just know you know you're

738
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:16,559
kind of the tingling in your fingers

739
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,880
you look at those statistics you go yep

740
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:20,480
it's not right something's coming

741
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,320
and something's going to crack open the

742
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,840
locks if we don't

743
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:28,158
look for the risk and close that risk as

744
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:30,639
soon as possible

745
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,320
so this kind of ties into the third part

746
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,400
of this approach

747
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,799
um because of course we can see things

748
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:39,520
we can make observations

749
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,720
and recommendations about how we think

750
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,279
the world

751
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:45,360
should change or needs to change but we

752
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:46,080
need partners really to implement that

753
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,439
and make it

754
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,439
just a part of the culture of the

755
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,640
organization otherwise we're just

756
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,480
playing whack-a-mole you know we're

757
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,360
waiting for the next thing to go wrong

758
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,320
so we can react to it so what we find is

759
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,799
really important

760
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,879
we try as a security function to be as

761
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,918
engaging and to communicate as much as

762
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,000
possible

763
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,080
we look for operations to collaborate

764
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,960
both across our business

765
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,918
more broadly across government and also

766
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,000
specifically

767
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:14,080
you know with technical partners people

768
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,159
that can give us new capability

769
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,760
so we're looking to discover like minds

770
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,799
in effects

771
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,640
because you know what i've kind of

772
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,240
captured here on the slide is that all

773
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,520
of our organizations really have this

774
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,200
same secret

775
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,039
no one really understands the security

776
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,559
function and most of them in fact fear

777
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,600
it because you know you tend to be the

778
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,279
no police

779
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,520
we're telling people not to do things so

780
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,559
we're going to produce a report or a

781
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,879
function

782
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,399
that tells them off in some way people

783
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,640
don't like that

784
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,320
but also i think most organizations

785
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,760
definitely have a realization now

786
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,520
because they read the news and they see

787
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,919
what's going on that they can't do

788
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:51,120
without a good security function

789
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:53,279
we really are as the diagram shows

790
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,360
we're the fig leaf that spares their

791
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,919
ultimate blushes you know we stop

792
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,559
everything being displayed in the public

793
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,440
domain

794
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,960
so we know we needed i think the way

795
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,919
we're trying to change this dynamic

796
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,440
through the partnership and

797
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:07,039
communications

798
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,400
is that we're trying to move away from

799
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,320
being you know like the policeman you

800
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,480
know telling people not to do things

801
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,399
to be more like a mountain guide so

802
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,960
we're saying yep you can climb the

803
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,400
mountain

804
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,080
you know you go for the highest peaks

805
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,919
and get the best views

806
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,760
but we're going to tie the ropes on for

807
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,640
you so if you make a mistake and you

808
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,559
fall

809
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,799
it's not a fatal fall you know we can

810
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:27,760
stop the ultimate disaster from

811
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,840
happening

812
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,960
and we find that that's a culture that

813
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,959
that works best for us

814
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,000
these are just carrying on from the

815
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,559
previous slide these are just a couple

816
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,720
of

817
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,559
approaches really in that communications

818
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,159
and collaboration space that we found

819
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,678
have worked well for us

820
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:45,520
i think having someone else voice the

821
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:47,600
message we have a great cons and change

822
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,840
person who works for us

823
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,520
who helps articulate that really in

824
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,918
normal language you know we don't

825
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,559
put tech speak or if we do she takes it

826
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,200
out for us

827
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,720
and she engages through yammer and you

828
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,120
know newsletters

829
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,200
she runs a lunch and learn program that

830
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,399
articulates what the security team are

831
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,919
trying to do

832
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,080
and the behaviors we want to encourage

833
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,080
in others that works really well

834
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,678
i think also this second point auditors

835
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,240
really are our friend particularly in

836
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:15,360
government

837
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:17,679
they are um a report they are an entity

838
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,520
that our executive listen to

839
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,200
and very often there is the case that we

840
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,960
say there's a problem

841
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,559
our executive go yeah but there's no

842
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,840
resources he can't fix it

843
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,200
then the auditors come and say there's

844
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,039
the same problem and suddenly the

845
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,880
resources become available

846
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:33,200
so audit reports and being engaged in

847
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,960
the audit process has proven very

848
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:36,320
useful for us because it helps us steer

849
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,159
the expectations

850
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,158
and it helps us respond to those audit

851
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,559
findings as well and use the

852
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,279
remediation capital and the resourcing

853
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:47,360
in the most effective way

854
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:48,960
using business change management process

855
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,600
now for us that actually is a separate

856
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:54,720
team so change management again is

857
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:55,360
not a technical or technician's sort of

858
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,799
purpose

859
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,559
to deliver we found if we can explain it

860
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,440
to the change management people and they

861
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,600
can take

862
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,919
a security initiative and engage with

863
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,279
end users stakeholders

864
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,640
that people will probably listen to them

865
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,480
more than they would looking to us as

866
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,360
you know the security nerds who

867
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,760
tell them that you've got to do

868
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,678
something differently so that change

869
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,799
management process and benefits

870
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,799
realization

871
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,480
is really useful and typically what

872
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:22,240
we're doing now particularly in our

873
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,600
uh we're running a bit of a security

874
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,120
program

875
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,959
is that you know there is an initiative

876
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:29,120
there is some analysis i will sign off

877
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,559
on that maybe as the departmental head

878
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,239
and then i will hand it over to the

879
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,440
change team to implement

880
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:36,240
because they have to go out and figure

881
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,960
out well who cares as end users and

882
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:40,559
what are we going to change for them

883
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,279
this kind of leads on to

884
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:44,799
the fourth point you need to be

885
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,039
discussing throughout this process

886
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:48,799
options with the business you know don't

887
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:51,120
be doing things to them

888
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:53,679
that they don't understand or they don't

889
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:55,678
really respect the point of

890
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,799
you need to let them feel that they are

891
00:28:55,679 --> 00:29:00,000
making decisions

892
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:01,679
that impact their daily life now

893
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,120
that may not necessarily be the case all

894
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:05,600
the time but

895
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,199
um we have to take them on the journey

896
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,959
you know you can't just rock up and go

897
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,760
yep stop doing that thing start doing

898
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,360
this thing

899
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,279
and we're going to start monitoring and

900
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,320
you know implementing a compliance

901
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:17,840
regime

902
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,600
if you breach the new working activity

903
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,879
so definitely engage with the business

904
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,918
early

905
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,080
keep them there as part of the

906
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:26,000
deployment process use that change

907
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,158
management process to integrate with

908
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,159
them and communicate with them on a

909
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,240
regular basis as well

910
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,240
and my final point here in terms of the

911
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:36,880
collaboration and communication we found

912
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:39,120
great partnership with university

913
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:43,039
placements we worked with edith cowan

914
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:46,158
university over here in wa and we do

915
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:49,600
run for typically masters students

916
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:51,360
in last semester of their final year

917
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:53,120
so you know we look for people that are

918
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,439
doing well in their course

919
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,039
are interested in coming into an

920
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,520
organization at some scale

921
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,399
and we give them a 12-week placement and

922
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,960
we put them at

923
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:05,520
the coalface you know we really use them

924
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,520
in a positive way we expose them to the

925
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,360
problems of you know the customer and

926
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:12,720
all of the contradictions that come

927
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,360
in an organization of our size and you

928
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,559
know

929
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,479
ones that show interest and promise and

930
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:21,840
you know want to be engaged

931
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:22,559
we've now got uh three four of them that

932
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,279
have come on

933
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,799
with at least temporary contracts at the

934
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,159
end of their course

935
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,559
because we recognize they're really

936
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,159
valuable in bringing new initiatives and

937
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:33,039
new ideas that can really help the

938
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,919
business out

939
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:38,480
so i would certainly look and recommend

940
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:41,919
looking to those sorts of partnerships

941
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,720
as delivering additional value

942
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:46,399
this next slide is really just a summary

943
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,760
of the communications point because i

944
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,959
started thinking about this the other

945
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,640
night and i thought

946
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,919
yeah what's our communications been like

947
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,360
the last few months you know what

948
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:56,399
messages have we been

949
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,279
putting out there so i went and copied

950
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,479
and pasted

951
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:01,200
all of our yammer feed posts and some of

952
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,679
our email

953
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:05,760
newsletters and some of the other comms

954
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,279
that we send out to our executive

955
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,679
and just put them into a word cloud

956
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:11,279
generating list and i thought well

957
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,960
how do we come across i think this is

958
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,399
the sum of how we're perceived by the

959
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,440
organization

960
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:19,120
and not surprisingly we've spoken a lot

961
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,480
about health and the health department

962
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,120
that's our business at the end of the

963
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,840
day

964
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,239
the two other biggest words there which

965
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,000
of course

966
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,840
relate to frequency are that we talk

967
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,640
about data breaches because that is a

968
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,360
problem within

969
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,720
healthcare broadly and we talk about it

970
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:35,519
as being a risk

971
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,880
to the delivery of those health services

972
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,039
so we're trying to say that

973
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,600
security is not an abstract problem this

974
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:44,399
is something that if we get it wrong

975
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,000
we'll have an impact on patients and

976
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,559
doctors and nurses and people

977
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,399
that work in clinical environments there

978
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,480
is some research that we

979
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,918
referred to and we included in one of

980
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,760
our communications

981
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,440
that looked at data breaches hospitals

982
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,760
across the u.s

983
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:01,760
and observed that in months and years

984
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,360
following those data breaches

985
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,799
there was an increase in the mortality

986
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:07,439
rate in those hospitals

987
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,080
because of course people trusted certain

988
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,120
systems

989
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,960
less or some systems had to be retired

990
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,518
and in a data breach situation where

991
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:19,120
you're responding both to media

992
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:21,039
and to customer and user concerns

993
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,039
it's quite difficult to do that in a

994
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:25,120
planned way you're reacting without much

995
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:28,799
time to think about that reaction

996
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:31,360
so that can have really dire and

997
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,879
negative impacts for for patients you

998
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:34,399
know the people that really rely on our

999
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,880
services

1000
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,320
so that was interesting and i think in

1001
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,760
terms of looking at this cloud as well i

1002
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,279
was quite

1003
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,039
pleased you know pleasantly surprised

1004
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,960
that a number of the sort of softer

1005
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:46,240
words were coming through we spoke about

1006
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,399
being a team

1007
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:50,320
about being a trusted advisor about

1008
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,600
delivering services that can protect

1009
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,158
data

1010
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,840
and that we're committed you know we

1011
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,679
want to be part of that discussion and

1012
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:00,240
part of that relationship

1013
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,120
so this was good i'm going to share this

1014
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,679
with our comms

1015
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,439
person and really try and develop more

1016
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:07,840
of that type of messaging and

1017
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,960
i'd maybe encourage you to do the same

1018
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,279
so finally

1019
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,559
i just wanted to sort of look into our

1020
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,240
future really and highlight

1021
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:17,600
some of the challenges we know we've got

1022
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:19,360
coming up in in the short to medium term

1023
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:21,360
and working down this list you know we

1024
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:22,240
need uh there is going to be a search

1025
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,199
for a new

1026
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,159
cio for for health support services we

1027
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,039
lost our last

1028
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,600
cio a couple of months ago of course a

1029
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,720
new

1030
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:36,080
executive director at that level brings

1031
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:38,399
a new culture a new set of priorities so

1032
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,760
we're going to have to be ready to adapt

1033
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:41,518
to those

1034
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,120
but there is also this consultation

1035
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:45,519
taking place at the moment with the

1036
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:48,399
commonwealth as with regards to

1037
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:50,559
healthcare becoming a new definition

1038
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,320
within critical infrastructure

1039
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:54,399
and for us that will require more

1040
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:56,399
oversight from the commonwealth

1041
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,678
area uh probably more of an audit

1042
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:00,559
requirement

1043
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,039
and an uplift in the standards that

1044
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,399
although

1045
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,320
you know at the state level we've

1046
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:06,559
certainly been trying to mature that

1047
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:07,678
the last 12 to 18 months i think this is

1048
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,159
just going to give that

1049
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,599
a significant boost so we're going to

1050
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:15,040
have to be able to

1051
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:16,560
do more and report on more now

1052
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,679
our third point here is that you know we

1053
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,199
have been looking at this for a couple

1054
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,560
of years and we've had a security

1055
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:23,678
project running

1056
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:26,239
which helps us remediate certainly oag

1057
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,079
findings other audit findings and just

1058
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,638
some of the fundamental

1059
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,720
security issues that we just struggled

1060
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:36,639
to resource or

1061
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:38,239
have the space to define as part of bau

1062
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,560
now our funding for that and our

1063
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:42,879
timeline is now getting down to the last

1064
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,000
nine months and we've really got the big

1065
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:47,199
issues to resolve

1066
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:48,399
you know uh cloud access security broker

1067
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,638
dlp

1068
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,679
user education and training all those

1069
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,960
things

1070
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:54,800
so we know we're going to have to have a

1071
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,639
huge focus on that in the next few

1072
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,800
months

1073
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:59,839
in terms of kovid you know we just don't

1074
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,680
know

1075
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:04,160
in wa we've been lucky we've got we've

1076
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,520
had the hard border and our initial wave

1077
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,118
wasn't significant the consequence of

1078
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,839
the lockdown certainly was for us

1079
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,599
because it meant

1080
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:13,200
you know lots of regional travel was

1081
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,800
restricted here

1082
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,839
now if we do get a second wave and we

1083
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,839
return to that kind of environment

1084
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:21,520
um how do we deal with that how do we

1085
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:22,720
deal with it particularly if we go

1086
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,160
through the experience

1087
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:27,200
victoria has at the moment of the

1088
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:29,598
hospitals become critically loaded

1089
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:31,919
and that's something i know that the uk

1090
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:34,800
saw when they had a big surge in

1091
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,359
um covered cases you know you start have

1092
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:38,160
reduced

1093
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:39,680
oxygen supplies and for us in our

1094
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,480
geography as well

1095
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:44,560
the management of that supply chain is

1096
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,880
always going to be a problem

1097
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,839
if the second wave becomes a third wave

1098
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,960
fourth wave

1099
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:52,480
or just an ongoing pandemic you know

1100
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,670
there is no

1101
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,680
um there is no

1102
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:58,800
[Music]

1103
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:01,359
cure for the for the virus

1104
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,359
then our the current state of emergency

1105
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,560
that we're in almost becomes bau you

1106
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:06,240
know we're always going to be in that

1107
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,640
state of emergency

1108
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,359
so how do we manage that in terms of the

1109
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:11,598
response

1110
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:13,119
at the moment which so far this year has

1111
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,440
cost us you know the best part of nine

1112
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:17,280
million dollars

1113
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,280
does it require another nine million

1114
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,920
does that nine have to become part of

1115
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,800
our

1116
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,680
next year's funding um that's a

1117
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,920
challenge for us

1118
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,160
to understand the consequences and to

1119
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,760
plan for it

1120
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,440
in terms of that second last point we're

1121
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,240
always going to be hurting the cloud

1122
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:36,160
cats there's just more cloud stuff

1123
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,078
happening all the time

1124
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,839
um we're working through a process at

1125
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,240
the moment there's a financial system

1126
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,160
that's

1127
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:43,520
you know an industry standard that's

1128
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,839
moving from

1129
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,040
an installed platform to a cloud

1130
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:49,520
platform

1131
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:50,079
but the cloud platform has overseas

1132
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,560
backup

1133
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:54,320
requirements particularly difficult when

1134
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,359
you're trying to transfer employee

1135
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:59,440
pii over those sorts of systems so we're

1136
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:02,960
being asked to consult a lot more and to

1137
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,280
work with vendors to review privacy

1138
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,720
clauses within contracts to complete

1139
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,240
risk assessments

1140
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:10,480
there's just a lot going on in that

1141
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:12,078
space as well and the last point of

1142
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,440
course is all of the above requires

1143
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:16,720
funding

1144
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,440
um you know both project funding bau

1145
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,078
funding

1146
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,280
covered response funding how does it all

1147
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:24,720
tie together and

1148
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:26,960
while we are a 10 billion a year system

1149
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,200
the money that gets spent on ict and

1150
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,520
particularly on security

1151
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,240
the clinicians look at as money that is

1152
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,960
not spent

1153
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:37,598
on the elderly or you know newborn

1154
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,160
babies whatever the critical

1155
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:42,000
care requirements are so we have to

1156
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,680
always be careful about

1157
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,720
justifying and um showing the return on

1158
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,160
benefit really

1159
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,200
for the money that we do spend that's

1160
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,598
the end that's

1161
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,839
my thoughts on the world thank you very

1162
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,520
