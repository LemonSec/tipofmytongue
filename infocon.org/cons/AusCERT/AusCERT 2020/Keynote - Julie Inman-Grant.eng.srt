thank you so much the introduction and

37
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,560
i'll have you know that i don't have

38
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,000
that same kind of influence in the

39
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,479
household which is um a

40
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,880
challenge with uh three kids a husband

41
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:16,880
and a pup

42
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:22,158
um but it is a very much a pleasure to

43
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,240
speak to you today about my work as the

44
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,159
australian safety commissioner and also

45
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,158
about the special challenges that coved

46
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,759
19 has created for us

47
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,759
and i'm sure that for each of you as

48
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,759
adam mentioned the past six months have

49
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,600
been just as challenging

50
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,960
before i begin i would also like to

51
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,360
acknowledge the traditional

52
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,000
owners of the land on which we all live

53
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,320
and work

54
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,479
and i pay my respects to the elders past

55
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,600
and present and the aboriginal elders of

56
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,200
other communities

57
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,880
who may be here today i have attended a

58
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,720
few oscert conferences

59
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,000
in my time and of course the highlight

60
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,640
for me was always

61
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,880
the cocktail party um when i was a

62
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,439
single gal at microsoft i used to say

63
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,320
hey

64
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,199
the odds are good but the goods are odd

65
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,320
so anyway

66
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,360
i ended up marrying an accountant and

67
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,760
hasn't life changed i mean tonight

68
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,400
i guess i'll be drinking alone in my

69
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,079
office

70
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,080
with the door shut because i missed the

71
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,400
opening plenary session and i want to

72
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,760
give my congratulations to michelle and

73
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,720
rachel who i understood

74
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,440
um took out some awards last night so

75
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,440
seriously

76
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:28,160
um i'll leave the jokes to adam from now

77
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,319
on um i'm especially pleased to have the

78
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,400
opportunity to talk to ozer

79
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,040
because we in online safety have a lot

80
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,640
to learn from the security community

81
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,160
and i'm constantly struck by the

82
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,238
maturity of your profession

83
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,680
and in particular the fact that security

84
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,920
by design is now

85
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,760
commonplace in most product and service

86
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,160
assessments

87
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,200
cyber safety and cyber security while

88
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,319
complementary

89
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,640
are also quite distinct while all of you

90
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,119
might

91
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:57,040
conceptualize cyber security differently

92
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,879
i tend to think of it as the physical

93
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,000
operation of the networks and computers

94
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,319
over which the internet

95
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,519
is delivered and the technologies

96
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,958
systems people

97
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:09,599
and processes surrounding it by contrast

98
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,560
cyber safety concerns more of the

99
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,879
emotional and

100
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,840
psychological impact of what you see

101
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,159
read and hear

102
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,159
online the personal rather than

103
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,879
necessarily the economic online harms

104
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,560
that people

105
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,879
are increasingly experiencing every day

106
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,680
but i also see safety security and

107
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,879
privacy

108
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,760
as three legs of the same stool if

109
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,319
all three legs are not balanced the

110
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,959
stool

111
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,958
will surely fall over in my roles

112
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,879
heading up safety security and privacy

113
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,200
for microsoft for instance

114
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,640
safety was all often treated as the poor

115
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,000
cousin to its

116
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:48,238
elder siblings so we need to be thinking

117
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,519
about where there are similarities where

118
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,440
there are differences

119
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,159
but how we can harness our work together

120
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,439
because there are so many important

121
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:57,439
interdependencies and i'll talk a little

122
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,920
bit in a moment about e-safety's work to

123
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,159
elevate

124
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,679
safety up as a relative priorities to

125
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,239
security and privacy

126
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,280
and to promote a culture of safety by

127
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:07,200
design

128
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,439
but first for those of you who are not

129
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,798
familiar with safety let me bring you up

130
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:15,519
to speed

131
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:19,120
slide 2 please we were established

132
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,880
in 2015 e-safety is a regulator with a

133
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,759
range of civil powers to compel the

134
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,759
takedown

135
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,520
of illegal or harmful content whether

136
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,240
it's pro-terrorist content

137
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,799
child sexual abuse material image-based

138
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,280
abuse

139
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,160
or serious cyber bullying directed at a

140
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,400
child

141
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,080
definitely barber cue stopping

142
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,919
conversations

143
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,400
to prevent such harms occurring in the

144
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,320
first place as much as possible e-safety

145
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,000
has a huge focus on prevention

146
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:46,159
through the provision of evidence-based

147
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,759
resources and outreach programs

148
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,360
to help australians to have more

149
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,960
positive and empowering online

150
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,639
experiences

151
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,479
and i'm proud to say that in just five

152
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,080
years we've reached millions of

153
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,320
australians with our education

154
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,880
resources and training and provided

155
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,680
relief to thousands of victims of online

156
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,600
abuse

157
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,720
now these kinds of services aren't

158
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,720
available anywhere else in the world

159
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,720
reaching parents is especially

160
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,560
challenging but important we

161
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,880
often refer to them as the front line of

162
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,320
defense and our own research has found

163
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,159
that 81

164
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,639
of australian parents are giving their

165
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,000
preschoolers access to the internet

166
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,840
through an interconnected device with 42

167
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,680
percent of australian appearances

168
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,440
parents telling us they provide access

169
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,800
to their children by the age of

170
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,039
two our outreach programs webinars

171
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,919
live seminars and other resources are

172
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,880
also tailored

173
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,840
to specific audiences to reach seniors

174
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,159
educators

175
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,638
front line domestic violence workers and

176
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,440
of a variety of at-risk communities and

177
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,600
this is where

178
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,440
co-design is really important where

179
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,160
we're doing this with the communities

180
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:53,759
rather than to the communities and as an

181
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,840
online safety regulator

182
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,960
we now have the equivalent of six

183
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:59,359
reporting schemes

184
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,318
including two that are quite new that

185
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,199
all operate

186
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,120
under a singular investigative division

187
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,440
slide three please

188
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,440
our world first cyber bullying complaint

189
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,639
scheme provides an invaluable safety net

190
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,560
to australian children

191
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:13,840
affected by serious cyber bullying so

192
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,600
that's bullying that's seriously

193
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:18,719
harassing intimidating

194
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,160
humiliating or threatening um and we

195
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,840
know that one in five

196
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,880
australian children have experienced

197
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,840
cyber bullying the average age is 14

198
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,919
but going down and the girls are bullied

199
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,919
online more than boys

200
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,039
so for youth based cyber bullying the

201
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,880
online abuse

202
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,639
tends to be peer-to-peer and is an

203
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,159
extension of bullying that's happening

204
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,479
in the school yard

205
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,240
so today we've received thousands of

206
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,039
cyber bullying complaints

207
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,680
and these are often very complex and may

208
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,159
in fact

209
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,479
feature what we call imposter or

210
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,199
phoenixing the phoenixing of accounts

211
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,080
this is a more recent phenomena amongst

212
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,080
young people

213
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,919
and by phoenixing we mean that the the

214
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,599
renewal and rebirth of harassing

215
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,520
accounts after they've been suspended

216
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,560
for violations of the social platforms

217
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,960
guidelines

218
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,880
some of them often lie inert until one

219
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,680
is taken down then another one

220
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,680
rises up in its place in the industry

221
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,199
it's also known as abusive account

222
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,240
recidivism

223
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:18,639
so about 15 percent of the

224
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,280
complaints of youth-based cyber bullying

225
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:22,240
involve

226
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,880
direct threats of violence or harm

227
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,240
including

228
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,520
telling young people to gky

229
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,680
or go kill yourself you can only imagine

230
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,359
the devastating impact on a young person

231
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,240
who might already be struggling or

232
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,720
vulnerable

233
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,800
what this impact might have and this

234
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,319
particularly holds true as protecting

235
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,759
the mental health of our young people

236
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,800
particularly through the coven 19

237
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,520
lockdown

238
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,720
has been extremely challenging and to

239
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,198
that end we've seen

240
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,840
a lot more bullying with a coronavirus

241
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,639
um

242
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:54,239
flavor like um fake memorials to kids

243
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,120
that have supposedly died from

244
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,560
chronovirus and have haven't or you know

245
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,199
telling a peer that

246
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,759
they hope you get coronavirus and die so

247
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,599
um

248
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,520
there's more commentary about um

249
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,599
modeling good on a good online

250
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,799
and real life behavior but i'll save

251
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:13,840
that for another time

252
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:16,160
so despite the increasing nature

253
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,239
and complexity of the complaints our

254
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,199
cyber bullying team does work diligently

255
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,000
to make sure that

256
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,919
we help the people involve this and

257
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,120
ensure the swift removal of offending

258
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,359
content from the social

259
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,120
media sites we know that the quicker we

260
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,160
get this harmful content directed a

261
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,000
child down

262
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,000
the more quickly we relieve them of the

263
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,120
humiliation and emotional anguish this

264
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,039
causes them

265
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,640
you know in k in so many of the cases

266
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,519
where we pick up the phone and talk to

267
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,838
the kids

268
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,159
uh we've sent about 12 000 kids on to

269
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,240
kids helpline for mental health support

270
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,480
but we also go a step end up going a

271
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,279
step further by involving um where the

272
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,680
child wants

273
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,360
parents school officials so that we can

274
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:54,160
make sure that we're tackling the social

275
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,080
conflict

276
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,760
at its core and once that happens then

277
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,720
the contents taken down

278
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,880
the cyber bullying does tend to stop

279
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,920
slide four please

280
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:07,920
e-safety also provides a

281
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,760
german-led reporting service for victims

282
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,599
of image-based abuse

283
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,760
so australians who have had their

284
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,640
intimate images shared or threatened to

285
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:17,519
be shared

286
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,279
without their consent and these off

287
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,480
these also include deep fakes

288
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:24,720
or um you know photoshopped in images

289
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,160
uh when i was announced as the e-safety

290
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,040
commissioner they they said you're going

291
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,319
to take on the

292
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,920
revenge porn portal and i said revenge

293
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,680
porn there's no way in the world i'm

294
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,439
going to call it that revenge for what

295
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,880
we don't want this to lead to victim

296
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,640
blaming

297
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,000
but unfortunately this has been one of

298
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,839
the more fastest

299
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,680
fastest growing areas of our business

300
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:49,519
we know from 2017 that image-based abuse

301
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,079
affects about one in ten australians

302
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,800
we've also

303
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,839
seen subsequent research from rmit and

304
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,760
monash

305
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,360
that shows that that's on the rise

306
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,000
particularly as people

307
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,680
are relying on digital intimacy tools

308
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,040
during the lockdown if they're

309
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:08,160
separated from their love interests

310
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,640
but since we opened the doors for this

311
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,360
scheme

312
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,040
in october 2017 we've helped almost 4

313
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,920
000 victims get their

314
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,360
intimate images and videos taken down we

315
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,479
have about a 90

316
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,240
success rate in cases of um removing

317
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,200
these intimate images sometimes up to

318
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:28,320
two or three hundred urls per case

319
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:31,440
from hundreds of overseas platforms so

320
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,600
from september 2018 we were given

321
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,839
additional tools to tackle image-based

322
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,360
abuse through a new civil penalty scheme

323
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,600
which allows us to tackle the

324
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,519
perpetrators and the hosting sites

325
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,440
through a range of tools including

326
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,560
warnings infringement notices

327
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,720
and significant fines as well

328
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,160
and so this does give us significantly

329
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:51,360
new leverage in targeting the

330
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,160
perpetrators and the

331
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,480
labelers of this heinous abuse and there

332
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:58,319
are also criminal statutes on the books

333
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,880
in most states and territories i think

334
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:03,760
tasmania is the current holdout

335
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,320
but it it's really important to remember

336
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:06,640
that

337
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,640
many victims do not want to pursue

338
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,480
criminal charges or litigation that

339
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,480
simply resurfaces the humiliating

340
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,480
material

341
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,760
you know prosecutions may prove to be an

342
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,560
expensive drawn out

343
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,040
and painful exercise um and it's often

344
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,760
um

345
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,680
by somebody that they know so what

346
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,439
victims generally want is for the

347
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,680
content to be taken down

348
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,959
and we can do this sometimes in a matter

349
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,640
of hours

350
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:35,760
but often within the course of a week

351
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,959
overall about 60 of our iba reports

352
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,800
involve women

353
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,359
with more than a third of these under

354
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,000
the age of 18 so it then becomes child

355
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,360
sexual abuse

356
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,200
material recently thirty percent of our

357
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,040
reports have including heartbreaking

358
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,120
cases of sextortion

359
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,399
or black male with the threat to share

360
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,800
images or videos

361
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,320
targeting adolescents and often young

362
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,240
men including international

363
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:02,399
university students slide five please

364
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,959
our cyber report team works at the

365
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:06,800
pointier end of the online harm spectrum

366
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,800
focused on disrupting online child

367
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,399
sexual abuse material and dealing with

368
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,079
other forms of illegal and harmful

369
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:14,240
online content

370
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,680
for the past 20 years the australian

371
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,480
government has been operating a

372
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,638
prohibited online content scheme

373
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,560
over the last five years cyber report

374
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:24,000
has been responding to reports from the

375
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,000
public and law enforcement about

376
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,440
prohibited or potentially prohibited

377
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,600
online content

378
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:31,440
and we work with the law enforcement and

379
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,320
our international partners to get this

380
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,800
child sexual abuse material taken down

381
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,079
last year we had the highest level of

382
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,560
investigations ever

383
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,239
14 000 investigations into illegal

384
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,239
online content

385
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,639
and over the life of our scheme

386
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:50,000
australian industry has complied with a

387
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,959
hundred percent of our takedown notices

388
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,040
but in recent times we've seen a

389
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,599
sustained higher volume of child sexual

390
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,839
abuse

391
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,279
material being produced by children

392
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,760
themselves

393
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:03,920
using smartphones tablets and other

394
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,839
connected devices

395
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,519
here at esafety we refer to this

396
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,920
material as coerced

397
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,279
rather than self-produced child sexual

398
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,439
abuse content

399
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,279
as we've observed that a significant

400
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,880
proportion of these vulnerable children

401
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:19,920
are often being groomed

402
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,480
manipulated and intimidated by predatory

403
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,199
adults

404
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,079
into recording or live streaming these

405
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,760
performances

406
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,560
on demand our investigators are seeing

407
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,040
videos

408
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,800
of six or seven-year-olds performing sex

409
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,839
acts on the camera

410
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,680
on iphones or ipads in the privacy

411
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,040
of their bedrooms and bathrooms and i

412
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,079
can tell you that in some of these

413
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,399
videos

414
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,199
we can hear the parents voices in the

415
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,279
next room

416
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,719
calling them for dinner so this is one

417
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,680
of the reasons we

418
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,480
we really implore parents to have their

419
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,638
kids

420
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,160
using technology out in open areas of

421
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,720
the house they can see what they're

422
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,399
doing

423
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,920
i'm sure your mother told you when you

424
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,760
were a teenager nothing good happened

425
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:03,199
behind closed doors

426
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:06,480
in any case next slide please

427
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:08,959
over 99 of of e-safety investigations

428
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,959
were completed within two business days

429
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:13,518
and depending on the case are notified

430
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:15,920
to the afp or to the in-hope network

431
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,199
in hope or the international association

432
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,319
of internet hotlines

433
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:21,279
is a global network of 46 hotlines in 42

434
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,279
countries

435
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:24,639
dedicated to combating online child

436
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,800
sexual abuse

437
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,560
next slide please and here's how the

438
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,319
process works

439
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:32,479
after assessing the material as child

440
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:34,800
sexual abuse material the team notified

441
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,639
the url to a shared management platform

442
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,279
housed at interpol

443
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:41,519
content at the illegal url is crawled

444
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,519
and scraped with images and hashes being

445
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,240
ingested by the interpol child sexual

446
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,279
exploitation

447
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,480
database to aid in victim identification

448
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,199
efforts

449
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,639
at the same time the url is notified to

450
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,439
the relevant hotline in the host

451
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,000
jurisdiction

452
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,440
for takedown according to its own local

453
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,800
policies

454
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,880
between 2017 and 2019

455
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,880
the number of csem related images and

456
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:09,760
videos processed by inhope

457
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:12,320
almost doubled to more than 456 thousand

458
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,000
so by notifying in hope and leveraging

459
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,079
this international network of partners

460
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
we're able to facilitate rapid takedown

461
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,839
of content and law enforcement action

462
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,680
where appropriate

463
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,320
while police focus on the victim

464
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:27,359
identification and going after the perps

465
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,160
our focus at e-safety is on the removal

466
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,560
of this harmful

467
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,920
material from the internet as well as

468
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,560
also understanding

469
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,599
um the economic drivers and how to

470
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,758
disrupt

471
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:41,600
this kind of trade in images at scale

472
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:43,600
by achieving the harmful takedown of

473
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,600
content though we're not only protecting

474
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,880
australians who may view this material

475
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,120
from online harm

476
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,199
but we're also providing support for the

477
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,839
child victims of this abuse

478
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,959
who can be traumatized and

479
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,440
re-traumatized by this material

480
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:59,439
following them throughout their lives

481
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,360
and part of the trauma for survivors

482
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,880
is a fear of being recognized by those

483
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,880
who have viewed their abuse material

484
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,480
justified in a um survey of

485
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:12,480
child sexual abuse of survivors in

486
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:15,199
canada 20

487
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:16,079
of them had people approach them on the

488
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,800
road and

489
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,680
say oh i saw you in that pornographic

490
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,839
series

491
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,880
as if they were willing participants in

492
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:26,000
this so

493
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:28,320
so the threat is very real

494
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,639
so all of this to say we of course

495
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,959
recognize that technology is rapidly

496
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,199
changing the online landscape

497
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,239
so we constantly need to stay a step

498
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,160
ahead

499
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,360
we also well understand that the

500
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,600
internet is global

501
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,399
and that we're never going to be able as

502
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,079
a small

503
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,720
organization to go to war with the

504
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,239
internet but that we need to join forces

505
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,199
with other committed leaders in this

506
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,959
space

507
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,439
and one of the ways we do this is by

508
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,800
stepping up to take a role globally

509
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,480
so for instance our head of

510
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,240
investigation serves as the vice

511
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,240
president of the in-hope board so that

512
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,040
we can modernize its operations and

513
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,920
future proof

514
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:05,199
its efficacy as a network next slide

00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,438
please

516
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,280
to that end last year i joined the

517
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:11,360
policy board of the we protect global

518
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:13,918
alliance with the likes of interpol

519
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,119
thorne unicef the european commission

520
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,199
microsoft

521
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:19,520
and other global leaders in combating

522
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:22,559
online child sexual abuse

523
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,480
more than 100 countries and 70 companies

524
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,879
and civil society organizations have

525
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,120
joined

526
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,520
joined the alliance and are committed to

527
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,439
making significant steps to work towards

528
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,639
the eradication of child sexual abuse

529
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,000
material

530
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,320
um this slide i'm showing you here

531
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,360
walks through what we call the global

532
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:45,120
strategic risk response which i had the

533
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:48,479
the pleasure of launching an arizaba

534
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:51,439
in december and it just illustrates um

535
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:53,200
how many different machinations have to

536
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,120
be working together

537
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,480
to to really integrate our collective

538
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,840
global efforts and

539
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,160
collaborate across domains functions and

540
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,480
specializations

541
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,520
so it takes legislative change it takes

542
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,760
victim support

543
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,440
it takes um staying a step ahead in

544
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,919
terms of technology

545
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,960
because we know these challenges are

546
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,039
complex

547
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,480
we also know the resourcefulness of

548
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,320
online predators coupled with the

549
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,000
resilience of their networks

550
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:20,080
and the constantly shifting thrift

551
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,120
landscape and transnational character of

552
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,399
the internet

553
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:28,559
dictate this multi-pronged approach

554
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,640
so next slide please another interesting

555
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,639
global clock collaboration that

556
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:34,240
demonstrates that it takes a network to

557
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,600
fight a network

558
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,919
um explains why we joined um the project

559
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,240
arachnid

560
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,080
project um and this is an amazing

561
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,919
technological tool that was developed by

562
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,000
the canadian center for

563
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,000
child protection which is designed to

564
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,160
reduce the availability of child sexual

565
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,840
abuse images online but also to help

566
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,919
break the cycle of abuse experienced by

567
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,320
survivors the scale of what this crawler

568
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,840
does

569
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:04,399
is amazing um thus far it's scanned

570
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:06,799
nearly 125 billion

571
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,039
images on the clearweb and has flagged

572
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:13,120
nearly 22 million

573
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:15,039
as new suspected images of child sexual

574
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,600
abuse that were not known

575
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:20,000
project arachnid detects around 100 000

576
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,678
images related to csam that require

577
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,280
further analyst assessment

578
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:27,840
each month so as part of the project

579
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:29,600
analysts from esafety are daily helping

580
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,120
to classify these images

581
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,959
so that we can contribute to the

582
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:35,199
international effort to build a

583
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,360
comprehensive central database of hashes

584
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,000
or digital fingerprints of known child

585
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,959
sexual abuse

586
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,880
material but we also gain access to the

587
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,440
raccoon hash list api

588
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:47,679
and by comparing our own image hashes

589
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,080
amongst those provided by arachnid

590
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,000
then we're also able to reduce our

591
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:54,879
investigators exposure to the harmful

592
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,559
content that they they see every day and

593
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,799
as i'm sure you would agree

594
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:00,639
these investigators are precisely the

595
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:01,520
kinds of heroes we've been talking about

596
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,400
these past

597
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,360
few days so we absolutely need for their

598
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,320
well-being

599
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,320
slide 10 please

600
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,120
these regulatory roles sit alongside the

601
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,760
new powers we were granted following the

602
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,280
horrific

603
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,919
attacks carried out last year in

604
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,840
christchurch as you would well remember

605
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,760
the perpetrator of these attacks live

606
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:24,480
streamed his actions and posted

607
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,158
an abort a manifesto online as he sought

608
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:28,559
to traumatize the community and

609
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:30,159
radicalize other individuals

610
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,678
in the wake of all this the federal

611
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,520
parliament moved quickly

612
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,360
to grantee safety the power to issue

613
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,520
content and hosting services with a

614
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:40,799
notice about providing access

615
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,960
to a born violent content

616
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,000
such material includes perpetrator

617
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,559
produced

618
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,559
content showing violent terrorist acts

619
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,120
leading to death or serious injury

620
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:51,120
murder

621
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,639
attempted murder torture rape and

622
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,399
kidnapping

623
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,240
since the legislative was enacted in

624
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,200
april we've completed

625
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:01,440
regulatory investigations into over 800

626
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,200
instances of avm

627
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,640
the overwhelming majority of these

628
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,000
claims has concerned the rape of

629
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,840
children which are dealt with through

630
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,080
our online content scheme

631
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:12,320
and today we've issued about 20 avm

632
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:13,600
notices to content services and hosting

633
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,639
services regarding

634
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,840
12 items of content 10 of these items

635
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,360
have since been removed

636
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:23,360
from the internet next slide please

637
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,799
eight of the notices concerned material

638
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:27,678
posted to the internet by the

639
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,360
perpetrator of the christchurch attacks

640
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,280
you may have seen soon after these

641
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,399
attacks australia's major internet

642
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,520
service providers

643
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:36,720
vodafone optus telstra tpg foxtel

644
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,200
infocus

645
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:41,360
voluntarily blocked access to 40 of the

646
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,799
websites hosting the christchurch attack

647
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:46,080
videos are manifested

648
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:49,120
by the perpetrator which i do think

649
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:51,520
really did um disrupt the ability for it

650
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,678
to go more viral

651
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,039
and while they had this a wonderful plan

652
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,640
with a wonderful intention

653
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:58,559
they didn't think about what needed to

654
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,600
be done to unblock

655
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:04,799
so we had had some fairly extensive

656
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:08,158
negotiations and for the first time

657
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:12,480
we worked up an isp protocol and

658
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:14,000
ordered the isps to continue websites

659
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,400
that continued hosting

660
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,320
the material we had worked with a number

661
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,400
of the the the 40 sites and some were

662
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,600
just not willing to take it down

663
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,080
so um i think it's worth noting that in

664
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,158
order

665
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,639
for us to invoke this extraordinary

666
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,480
power a live streamed event must be

667
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,360
determined to have reached an online

668
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,520
crisis event

669
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,918
threshold and that's a very very high

670
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,960
threshold so with all the shootings

671
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:41,520
um even the um hall a situation

672
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:43,120
on twitch none of them quite reached

673
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:47,280
that threshold

674
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:50,000
slide 12. next slide please

675
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,720
earlier this year i announced an another

676
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,480
protocol

677
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,720
agreed to with the isps that will

678
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,640
facilitate rapid removal of extreme

679
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,200
terrorist or violent content if

680
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,840
if immaterial um if a similar crisis

681
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,880
ever goes

682
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,120
viral again and i just want to make sure

683
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,880
that i

684
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,199
that we understand that there needs to

685
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,880
be a balance and discretion when

686
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,559
determining whether a site should be

687
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,559
blocked or not

688
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,918
australians place a very high value on

689
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:17,760
free speech

690
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:20,000
but i also think the australian

691
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,240
community expects to be protected from

692
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
material that is designed to traumatize

693
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,960
vulnerable individuals particularly

694
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,200
children

695
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,120
and we saw this quite vividly last week

696
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,880
with the suicide video that was live

697
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:33,439
streamed on facebook

698
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:35,280
and lied dormant for about a week but

699
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:37,360
then went viral across multiple

700
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,360
platforms including tick tock

701
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,199
with the graphic and distressing video

702
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,799
potentially being viewed by untold

703
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,320
numbers of school children across

704
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:45,918
australia

705
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,760
so all of these decisions will need to

706
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,520
be measured and made on a case-by-case

707
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,120
basis to ensure that we maintain the

708
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,679
safety of australians while not

709
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,760
overblocking content on the internet

710
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:58,559
this is a balance and a responsibility i

711
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:02,240
take really seriously

712
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:04,080
next next slide please let me turn now

713
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,760
to the extraordinary circumstances in

714
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,279
which we now live

715
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,279
where there is so much more additional

716
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,840
activity whether it's education

717
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:14,240
business social or family interaction

718
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:15,840
that has shifted to the internet

719
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,840
you would assume that such a development

720
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,120
would lead to a discernible rise in

721
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,080
internet harms

722
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,559
and there you'd be spot on the early

723
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:26,559
period of code 19 lockdown accompanied a

724
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:29,279
huge spike across e-safety's

725
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:31,039
all of our reporting areas and it won't

726
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,840
be surprising to you that in the wake of

727
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,158
covid

728
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,080
with the entire world converging online

729
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,320
that we've seen a sustained surge

730
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,960
around all forms of online abuse

731
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:44,320
vis-a-vis the same period last year

732
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,400
as of august we've seen 129 increase in

733
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:48,559
child sexual abuse material

734
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,880
a 63 percent increase in youth-based

735
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:53,678
cyberbullying and an 87 percent

736
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,960
increase in adult cyber abuse despite

737
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:57,679
the fact that we do not have a

738
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,679
legislative scheme for adults

739
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,480
meanwhile reports about image-based

740
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,559
abuse rose by more than

741
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,559
245 percent some of this

742
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,120
increase can be attributed to a current

743
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:11,678
sextortion scam that's really been doing

744
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,158
for about two years but we saw 600

745
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,600
percent

746
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:18,799
spike uh mr long weekend

747
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:21,760
uh there was a a coordinated email scam

748
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:22,799
um that many of you may have received

749
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,400
saying um

750
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:28,400
you know um we have your password and

751
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,400
we've hacked into your webcams unless

752
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,240
you pay us make a bitcoin payment we'll

753
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:35,760
share with your friends

754
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,360
and colleagues these um are offshores

755
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,400
offshore scams that are being

756
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,240
investigated at them at the moment

757
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,480
so i think as well as the sheer volume

758
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,679
of activity i think you're also seeing

759
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,520
the frustrations

760
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:49,279
and the uncertainty and the doubt around

761
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,679
covid tending to surface some of the

762
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,640
worst

763
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,679
aspects of human behavior online people

764
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,000
stuck at home

765
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,880
denied traditional support networks such

766
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,120
as fear

767
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,960
family networks have seen people tended

768
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,879
to lash out online

769
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,400
now this is both understandable but

770
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,279
highly regrettable

771
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:09,600
we've also seen a number of coordinated

772
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:12,400
what we call volumetric attacks

773
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:15,039
um some bike anti-vaxxers some by

774
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:17,120
conspiracy theorists but others by

775
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,158
white supremacists and extremists that

776
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,439
are targeting

777
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:23,679
targeting specific individuals with

778
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:26,640
avalanches of online hate that come

779
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,840
just under the the threshold of the um

780
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:31,039
platforms um

781
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,720
terms of use but the impact in terms of

782
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,840
the cumulative effect of the harm

783
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:38,000
is the same and we've likened it to

784
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,600
swatting individual bees in the midst of

785
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,400
a swarm so we are

786
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,879
in discussions with all the platforms

787
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,360
about

788
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,000
what tools they're using to detect

789
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,080
thwart

790
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,440
and prevent these kind of attacks

791
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,279
happening at scale

792
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,559
i think as you you've also seen they're

793
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:55,919
all struggling to keep

794
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,879
up with the increased harmful content on

795
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:59,440
their sites

796
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,440
particularly as content moderate

797
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:03,679
moderators have had to go home

798
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:05,520
you know of course you would know ai

799
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:07,600
only and natural language processing

800
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:10,720
only goes so far to surface

801
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:13,039
online abuse human moderation is is

802
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,799
required in the vast majority of reports

803
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:18,000
that they look at

804
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:19,760
so our research focus obviously shifted

805
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,640
during covits that could really

806
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:24,559
understand what was happening here and

807
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,799
we were disturbed to find that

808
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:28,559
40 of australians had a negative

809
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:30,399
experience online during the first few

810
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,879
months of the pandemic

811
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:34,959
and despite this australians did view

812
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:37,360
the international

813
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,880
utility uh during the covenant lockdown

814
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,439
particularly for paying bills and

815
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,440
banking

816
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,880
accessing news and information and of

817
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,880
course staying in touch with

818
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:49,279
friends um and i think we'll see

819
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,520
different trends in terms of in terms of

820
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:54,399
how we work how we communicate

821
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,720
um and we're also expecting a new normal

822
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,239
in terms of the elevated um threats of

823
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,279
abuse that we're seeing

824
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,399
online so while we can't live without

825
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,440
the internet

826
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:08,959
um we have to learn to live with it and

827
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:11,760
we hope in a more civil and safe way

828
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:13,440
and it's partly what feeds my confidence

829
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,120
that within the next few years that

830
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,760
there will be an international network

831
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:22,479
of regulators like the e-safety office

832
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:25,039
um one ireland's next the uk

833
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,360
but we do need a network to be able to

834
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,879
take on the social media networks at

835
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,320
scale

836
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,960
slide 14 please as i mentioned at the

837
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,039
outset

838
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,960
with privacy and security the features

839
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,760
of online products that protect users

840
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,679
interests

841
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,960
are designed into those products from

842
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,399
the insection

843
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:46,720
inception i was an agitator within the

844
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,120
companies for a long time for safety to

845
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,440
be

846
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,799
a higher priority and assume

847
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,080
commensurate status

848
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:57,039
at that i failed um so i'm trying um

849
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:58,320
i guess from the poacher term gamekeeper

850
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,440
perspective

851
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,439
um to try and encourage safety by

852
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:05,200
by design because i do believe we need

853
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,919
to shift the responsibility back

854
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,679
onto this tech sector for to create a

855
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,720
safer and more civil internet

856
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:14,480
um so using your language to you know to

857
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:17,440
lessen the threat surface

858
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,720
um by better policing what is happening

859
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,960
on their networks

860
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,720
by building protections in at the front

861
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,159
end rather than belting them on

862
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,120
in response to a revenue reputational or

863
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,480
regulatory

864
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:32,158
threat and we want again

865
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:34,320
um having worked for so long in the

866
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,360
industry i know this is not something

867
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,520
we're going to

868
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,520
regulate our way out of or or be

869
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,600
prescriptive around

870
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:44,639
to work with the industry rather than do

871
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:46,639
this to the industry so in 2018

872
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,240
we worked with industry and civil

873
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,559
society to develop

874
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:53,039
a set of safety by design principles the

875
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:55,279
major platforms have all agreed to

876
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:56,080
and we're currently in the process next

877
00:29:55,279 --> 00:30:00,320
slide

878
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:03,360
of developing two dynamic

879
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:05,840
self-assessment tools that will help

880
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,959
the companies well obviously there's one

881
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:08,799
for startups

882
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,159
and another that's geared for more

883
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,360
mature companies to help them

884
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,440
effectively implement

885
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,559
um safety by design as you can see from

886
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,880
this it it

887
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,158
it has five different modules it has it

888
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:21,600
starts with leadership

889
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:25,279
and governance but we'll also um

890
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:28,158
be weighted according to um

891
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:29,200
you know the the um specific names of

892
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,919
the platform

893
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,520
um and what other systems and processes

894
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:35,440
and policies they have in place but will

895
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:37,360
surface up best practice

896
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,480
so that particularly new and mid

897
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,840
mid-tier companies

898
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:44,159
don't have to start from scratch um and

899
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,480
you know we're working with in the

900
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,120
investor in bc communities to make sure

901
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,760
that they're

902
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:55,039
um they're encouraged

903
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:57,760
through safety by design as well so

904
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:59,600
in conclusion i want you to thank you

905
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:00,799
for tuning in and for listening to me

906
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,199
drawing on about a

907
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:05,360
few areas that may be outside a little

908
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:08,080
bit outside your direct wheelhouse

909
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,600
last slide please you can learn more

910
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,158
about everything i've talked about by

911
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,320
visiting esafety.gov.eu

912
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:16,320
i confidently believe that you'll find

913
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,879
it one of the most accessible online

914
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,879
safety hubs in the world and one of the

915
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,200
things i made sure of when i came across

916
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,840
from the tech sector to government was

917
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:28,320
that e-safety's own technology resources

918
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,959
would be forward-leaning and innovative

919
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,240
um so when we launched our website last

920
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,120
october

921
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,799
we had some great reviews and including

922
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,639
um a webby honoree

923
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,918
award but we want to make it um

924
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:43,760
accessible and nava

925
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:46,000
nava navigable um for everyone

926
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,320
but in closing let me pick up on the

927
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,880
theme of oscar 2020

928
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,559
we can be heroes and give you some

929
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:54,640
thoughts about what this means as far as

930
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:57,120
online safety is concerned

931
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,000
well certainly i i imagine a number of

932
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,559
you are

933
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,240
our parents and we should always be the

934
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:04,000
guides for our children as they commence

935
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,080
their internet journey

936
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,640
and we should strive to be just as

937
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,320
involved in our kids everyday lives as

938
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,240
in our their online lives the way that

939
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,960
we are their everyday lives

940
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,840
and as i often say parental controls are

941
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,120
fine

942
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,199
but a parental presence is much better

943
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:23,518
and we can all be heroes on social media

944
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,240
too where so much of the worst of

945
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,799
humanity

946
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:28,960
including misogyny racism and prejudice

947
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,960
seems to rise to the surface

948
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,559
by modeling this responsible civil

949
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,919
behavior on social media

950
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:36,399
including when we are having a

951
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:38,480
disagreement we can inspire those around

952
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:39,518
us to live up to the same standards and

953
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,919
to fight fair

954
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:43,039
online and instead of being mute

955
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,840
bystanders

956
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:47,440
we can also be upstanders and call out

957
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,439
the vicious cyber abuse that is

958
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,240
increasingly poisoning our social media

959
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,960
feeds

960
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:53,840
and report report report to the social

961
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,240
media sites

962
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,279
and should you need to to the e-safety

963
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,600
office

964
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:01,679
and finally since we are all

965
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,959
professionals working in or around the

966
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,799
tech sector

967
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:06,480
can i ask you to check out our safety by

968
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,559
design resources and to become

969
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:10,399
ambassadors for this concept as you move

970
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:13,279
amongst your professional networks

971
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:14,479
or even within your own organizations

972
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:17,039
i'm sure you'll agree

973
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:17,679
that it's an idea whose time has come

974
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:21,120
thank you

975
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:21,120
and i look forward to your questions

976
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,279
thank you very much julia a a a profound

977
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,440
and

978
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:29,200
an amazing presentation certainly not

979
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,000
droning on some massive issues that you

980
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,360
covered there

981
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,120
there's a string of questions that come

982
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,080
through i'll sort of amalgamate them

983
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:37,840
uh into three questions uh first of all

984
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:39,678
the personal toll for people like

985
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,760
yourself and the people who view and

986
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,679
review and remove this sort of

987
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,760
material how do you find as the mother

988
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,240
of three young kids yourself

989
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,000
that the the the will to keep going on

990
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:54,320
and dealing with this stuff that must be

991
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:54,320
at times horrible to to encounter

992
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,000
well i think sometimes it's precisely

993
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,200
the fact that i do have kids and that

994
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,320
um i do know um the horrors um

995
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,039
that you know propel us all all on i

996
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,879
mean

997
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:10,879
yeah we see terrible things every day

998
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:13,839
and so um and we

999
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:14,399
we actually see the worst of of humanity

1000
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,159
um but

1001
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:18,239
again i think that inspires us and it

1002
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:21,599
spurs us on to do more

1003
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:25,279
i think we all recognize that we

1004
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:28,240
need to help people and to change the

1005
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,000
the way the current online world is and

1006
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,799
that's a responsibility we all take

1007
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,119
seriously

1008
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,639
um and you know what's been really

1009
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,879
challenging is coming from the tech

1010
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:38,800
sector where there is no hierarchy

1011
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:40,239
and you know you move fast and break

1012
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,079
things and coming into the public

1013
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:44,560
service which tends to be

1014
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,720
um much more structured and monday to

1015
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,359
friday nine to five even though online

1016
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:50,560
harms

1017
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:51,359
take place at all you know 24 7 7 days a

1018
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,759
week

1019
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,560
is trying to pivot the organization to

1020
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,119
stay ahead

1021
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:59,200
step ahead and think about how

1022
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:01,680
technologies might be misused

1023
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,839
or harnessed for the future so we're a

1024
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,480
different kind of organization

1025
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,759
some of our investigators have been with

1026
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,839
us 10 years

1027
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,280
typically particularly in police forces

1028
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:12,720
you would only have

1029
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,560
people viewing child sexual abuse

1030
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,598
materials sitting in those roles for six

1031
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,400
months

1032
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:20,720
so as a result um we've invested a lot

1033
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:23,280
in the technology to make sure that we

1034
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:23,759
are masking what our investigators have

1035
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,040
to see

1036
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,280
but we have psychologists coming in

1037
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:30,400
and an extensive well-being program in

1038
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:33,359
fact

1039
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:34,400
we also make them well they have to um

1040
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,440
do other things

1041
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,040
like play tetris so certain video games

1042
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:42,480
have been shown

1043
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,000
to keep these images from lodging into

1044
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:47,440
their long-term memories

1045
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,160
and so um we use um a range of different

1046
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,960
um ways wow that's fascinating that's a

1047
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:53,040
discussion

1048
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,320
within itself just quickly someone asks

1049
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,880
someone who manages an internet

1050
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,200
connection

1051
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:58,400
servicing many schools what's the most

1052
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,640
important thing that needs to be in

1053
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,400
place to minimize the risk of e-abuse

1054
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,960
either within schools or what about at

1055
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,960
home as well

1056
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,400
yeah i mean again i think of homes and

1057
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,920
parents as the front line of defense the

1058
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:16,720
minute we're handing over

1059
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:18,640
a digital device we should be you know

1060
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,279
in an age-appropriate way and this is

1061
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:21,118
what the

1062
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,960
safety parents guide does it provides

1063
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,000
guidance we have that we now have a

1064
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,400
program for um

1065
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,440
for parents of under fives and the the

1066
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,640
messages there

1067
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:33,359
are you know to be safe to be kind

1068
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,000
to ask for help and make good decisions

1069
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,759
um

1070
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,680
but we need to be talking to our kids

1071
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,079
about respect and responsibility this is

1072
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,399
a

1073
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,599
privilege and not a right that you have

1074
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,839
technology

1075
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,720
setting limitations up front is really

1076
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:46,320
really important

1077
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,640
um i can tell you i've got a

1078
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,320
eight-year-old twins and a 14 year old

1079
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:52,000
if you don't set the limitations up

1080
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,599
front it's very difficult to

1081
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,200
to ratchet that back when they're

1082
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:58,240
teenagers um

1083
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:00,319
and also i think as as we saw with this

1084
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:02,078
this video this suicide video going

1085
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,960
viral last week

1086
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,960
um we uh when we talk to schools we

1087
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,320
often talk to them about the four r's of

1088
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,560
the digital age

1089
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,359
respect responsibility building digital

1090
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,240
resilience

1091
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:15,920
as well as critical reasoning skills um

1092
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:17,200
and because we have a fragmented

1093
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,000
education system

1094
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,598
with the states and territories and the

1095
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,640
catholics independence and public

1096
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,720
schools

1097
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,720
we don't see online safety education or

1098
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:29,759
digital citizenship

1099
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:32,160
taught consistently throughout

1100
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,440
a child's educational experience if

1101
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,078
we're going to give them the tools to

1102
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,000
teach them

1103
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:38,079
to be on technology we also need to

1104
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,720
teach them how to navigate it as well

1105
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:42,640
and we've worked um with the schools to

1106
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,118
develop a toolkit for schools

1107
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,720
it was an 18-month project but that's

1108
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:48,560
also on our website and we've got tons

1109
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,480
of resources for educators as well but

1110
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,240
it's everything from policies

1111
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,560
how do you deal with an explicit

1112
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:56,640
incident when it happens final question

1113
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:58,799
you pointed the issue of getting big

1114
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,598
tech on side here i won't get you to

1115
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:02,079
make

1116
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,520
i've heard some comments online saying

1117
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,839
big tech are just

1118
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:08,800
horribly slow and in denial about this

1119
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:10,480
others have said it's complicated

1120
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,920
could you answer me this in terms of

1121
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,680
trying to get big tech to do

1122
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,640
considerably more

1123
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:20,078
is the technology etc already there and

1124
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:22,960
there's just a resistance to using it

1125
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:24,880
or is it just an incredibly complicated

1126
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:27,200
issue and one they're not

1127
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,440
engaging in sufficiently if we wanted is

1128
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:30,879
there some serious low-hanging fruit the

1129
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,720
big tech could grab

1130
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,920
now to significantly reduce the

1131
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,480
incidence of this sort of

1132
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,480
material

1133
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,759
yeah i i think the answer to your

1134
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:44,160
question is both

1135
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:45,520
it is extremely complicated it it's it's

1136
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:47,920
an online arms way

1137
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,000
race and um you know we've got to

1138
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,839
remember that this is human behavior and

1139
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,720
the worst of human behavior playing out

1140
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,720
online

1141
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,839
and you know the platforms are being

1142
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,319
used to weaponize

1143
00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:00,000
this behavior but the harms are well

1144
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:03,359
known they've been documented for

1145
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:04,960
a long time the platforms know how their

1146
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:07,040
tools have been weaponized

1147
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,720
and my view is some are doing it better

1148
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,119
than others

1149
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,560
but it's really about priorities and

1150
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:14,560
it's about leadership

1151
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,759
they have vast financial resources you

1152
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:19,040
know the big big

1153
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:22,079
is just printing money they have um

1154
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:24,960
intellectual capability they have access

1155
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,680
to build you know the most extensive

1156
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,040
tools

1157
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,520
and they're employing them to a certain

1158
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,079
degree but it's it's like you're never

1159
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:32,560
going to

1160
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:34,000
eradicate crime in the real world you're

1161
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:37,040
never going to

1162
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:37,599
eradicate online abuse but we certainly

1163
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,079
could be

1164
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:41,200
doing a better job and this is why i'm

1165
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:44,720
so firmly

1166
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:45,598
behind the concept of safety by design

1167
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,720
and having

1168
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:50,560
the platforms take responsibility

1169
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,160
just like we expect when we get into our

1170
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,400
cars

1171
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:56,240
in the 1970s there weren't laws

1172
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,640
requiring seat belts and there weren't

1173
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:00,240
airbags yet but now they're governed by

1174
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:02,480
international standards and

1175
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:04,000
and you expect those seat belts to work

1176
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,079
now the companies need to be

1177
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,839
adding virtual seat belts and other

1178
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:10,079
protective mechanisms

1179
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,759
at the front and to mitigate against

1180
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:13,280
those risks rather than bolting it on

1181
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,280
after the damage has been done

1182
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,960
it is it is a case of in closing let me

1183
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:18,480
just echo something from chris that's

1184
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,079
been up voted by many people great

1185
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,960
presentation not a question but just a

1186
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:23,520
comment to say

1187
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,200
thank you for all that you and everyone

1188
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,880
that works in this space does to keep

1189
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,480
