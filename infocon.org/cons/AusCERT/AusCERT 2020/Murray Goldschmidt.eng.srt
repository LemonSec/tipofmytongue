murray goldschmidt whose presentation is

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,160
zero to pound

10
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:25,760
and with no zero days um i'll

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,359
presentation and then we'll feel all of

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,040
the questions for murray at the end of

15
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,719
his presentation

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,559
so take it away murray hello and welcome

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,960
this is murray goldschmidt here

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,399
executive director for cyber capability

19
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,000
education and training at

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:49,280
cyber cx thank you for joining us today

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,320
at the ulcerat 2020 online conference

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,719
today we're going to have an

23
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,760
action-packed presentation on

24
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:59,120
a case study in terms

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,599
of performing dynamic security testing

26
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,718
why this is so important we call this

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,159
zero to pone

28
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,760
with no zero days in today's

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,880
presentation we're going to cover four

30
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,119
main areas

31
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,119
firstly terms of cyber security risk

32
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,000
management what information is your

33
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,159
organization

34
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,240
or getting versus what they actually

35
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,680
need in terms of risk assessments

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,600
there's many different types

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,759
we're going to talk today the importance

38
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:26,640
about performing dynamic

39
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:27,520
assessments we're going to deliver a

40
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,840
case study

41
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,960
on a critical infrastructure assignment

42
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,759
that we've conducted

43
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,119
as a red team security review routine

44
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,400
penetration test

45
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,479
and we're going to conclude with the

46
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:42,560
learnings from a number of operating

47
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:44,560
tests that we've producted in past

48
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,920
in terms of presenting information to

49
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,000
your organisation

50
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,439
let's consider what your organization's

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,240
executive and board

52
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,199
need to know firstly business requires

53
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,439
visibility

54
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,560
visibility helps an organization to make

55
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,158
informed decisions

56
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,600
about the direction that their business

57
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,840
is tracking

58
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,719
also helps the business to address

59
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,520
compliance

60
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,320
and ultimately to improve shareholder

61
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,478
value

62
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,639
now if we look at some of the

63
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,800
obligations that directors have

64
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,079
for example the following graphic comes

65
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,480
from the apra

66
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,160
standards the organization has an

67
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,560
obligation to understand

68
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,959
about the implementation of security

69
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,440
controls within the organization

70
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:26,239
the organization also has a demo

71
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,280
demonstrate

72
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,680
effective testing to demonstrate whether

73
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,040
or not the controls are actually working

74
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,879
and ultimately these two things together

75
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,640
be able to help the organization to

76
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,079
identify their current information

77
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:43,200
security capability

78
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,760
maturity if we think about security

79
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,319
reviews

80
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,959
in the past normally these are done as

81
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,958
desktop

82
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,800
assignments as you can see in this image

83
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:52,879
and normally the assessor

84
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,000
the risk assessor will be using a

85
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,840
methodology

86
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,599
consistent with the graphic that you can

87
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,720
see on the screen at the moment

88
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,238
the the assessor is looking at a variety

89
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,319
of types of risks

90
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,519
and the extent to which they may apply

91
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,159
to the business

92
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,120
now ordinarily this is done through

93
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,519
interview

94
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,640
person is interviewing an executive in

95
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,680
the organization

96
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,279
now i've done a couple of google

97
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,959
searches on risk assessments

98
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,879
and you'd be surprised as to actually

99
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,159
what people are presenting and

100
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,159
publishing on the internet

101
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,840
i just found this graphic over here an

102
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,519
organization published the results

103
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,959
of one of their risk assessments now if

104
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,360
you look a little bit

105
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,159
closer you can see that this assessor

106
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,400
has identified

107
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:36,079
that the website in their organization

108
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,159
is of uh is a critical

109
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,680
asset clearly if the website is down the

110
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,319
organization can't contact their

111
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,480
business

112
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,399
but now let's look at the vulnerability

113
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,679
that this website presents to the

114
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,080
organization

115
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,080
in this case the assessor has identified

116
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,239
that it is unlikely to be affected

117
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,480
because the firewall is configured

118
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,840
and has a good denial of service

119
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,359
mitigation in place

120
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,879
now anybody who knows anything about

121
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,120
denial of service attacks

122
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,000
know that a firewall has little to no

123
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,040
capability

124
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,200
in its on its own to defeat or defend

125
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,560
against a denial of service attack there

126
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,599
are many different types of denial of

127
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,720
service attacks

128
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,119
volumetric attacks state-based attacks

129
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,478
crypto attacks and of course application

130
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,280
layer attacks as well

131
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:21,039
so a simple statement such as saying the

132
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,159
firewall is configured

133
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,880
uh properly can and therefore

134
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,000
will make the organization in a good

135
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,520
position to defend

136
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,520
against the dial of services tax

137
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,599
therefore the website is

138
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,599
being a critical asset unlikely to be

139
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,680
affected would know that this

140
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,280
risk assessment is essentially

141
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,240
meaningless and basically the

142
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,320
organization

143
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,280
should take no value based on the

144
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,759
assessment this

145
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,198
assessment alone the problem over here

146
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,000
is that the person who was asking the

147
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,160
questions

148
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,240
wasn't asking the right question they

149
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,840
didn't necessarily understand

150
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,840
the type of security issues that would

151
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,119
would arise from denial of service they

152
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,799
just took at face value

153
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,880
that a firewall was installed and the

154
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,240
firewall might provide denial of service

155
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,159
protection

156
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,520
you see normally risk assessments are

157
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,039
done in a spreadsheet

158
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,400
such as this there are a number of

159
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,120
different variables and the assessor

160
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,440
goes through

161
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,800
identifying the type of incident and the

162
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:17,120
effect that that student

163
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,800
may have within the organization

164
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,840
normally that person then goes and

165
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,199
punches numbers produces graphs presents

166
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,799
to the organization

167
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,320
and at the end of the day they say

168
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,120
hooray and they've done their risk

169
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,440
assessment

170
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,160
is it really as simple as that not

171
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,199
really

172
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,520
in fact this organization equifax

173
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,639
found it out the hard way they did do

174
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:38,479
security reviews

175
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,240
and risk assessments they just didn't do

176
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,639
them very well in fact

177
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,800
they were one of the the victims of the

178
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:47,919
one of the largest data breaches known

179
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,560
uh to us in history of the 300 plus

180
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,520
million

181
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,880
uh people in the us this breach affected

182
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,280
nearly a third of them

183
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,680
in fact it was such a substantial breach

184
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:00,318
that there were a number of

185
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,960
inquiries into the organization after

186
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,639
the fact

187
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,318
and there is massive settlements

188
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,000
occurring afterwards

189
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,400
if you look at some of the commentary

190
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,560
around the equifax data breach

191
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,679
the information that came out of it was

192
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,759
quite interesting

193
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,520
this report says that as a corporation

194
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,440
that deals with personally identifiable

195
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,240
information of over 200 million

196
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,160
u.s customers equifax has a legal and

197
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:25,360
moral responsibility to adopt

198
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,720
and an effective risk management program

199
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,560
that ensures that their customers

200
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,960
security is in place

201
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,880
equifax alone is responsible for

202
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,400
identifying and mitigating the risks

203
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,840
associated with their assets

204
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,679
including the sites that they use and

205
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,359
the third parties that they work with

206
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,440
think about how you and your

207
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,400
organization have an obligation

208
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,240
to protect the information that you hold

209
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,479
furthermore they went on to say

210
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,639
for too long organizations have whittled

211
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,359
away at prudent security protocols like

212
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,360
testing

213
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,120
implementing and monitoring because they

214
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,080
believe the steps will take a chunk out

215
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,639
of refugee

216
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,199
equifax is a perfect case study for this

217
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,800
problem

218
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:03,759
now think back to your organization as

219
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,240
well does your mandate to get a product

220
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,280
out to market or to get something online

221
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,120
very quickly

222
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:11,119
limit your ability to effectively test

223
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,919
it it happens more often than you can

224
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,919
think

225
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,039
let's look at what the government audit

226
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,240
office said

227
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,120
about the equifax issue the equifax

228
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,039
breach

229
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,120
they identified five areas where

230
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,880
security needed to be improved

231
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:29,199
identification detection segmentation

232
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,120
and a failure to rate limit database

233
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,360
requests those are four of them

234
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,039
all four of those are technical

235
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,319
requirements that need to be implemented

236
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,719
in the organization

237
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,720
the fifth one data governance is the

238
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,400
only

239
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:44,080
non-technical control that could have

240
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,159
been implemented

241
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,400
to further secure this organization

242
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,639
remember that the person conducting

243
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,159
a risk assessment might not have come

244
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,759
from a technical pedigree

245
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,759
and that's the reason why they

246
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,319
identified things such as

247
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,319
a firewall being able to prevent a

248
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,680
denial of service attack which we know

249
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,080
it can't so the important thing over

250
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,440
here

251
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:09,520
is to provide context for the assessment

252
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,560
which you are conducting and this is the

253
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,080
reason why

254
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:18,160
risk assessments cannot be assessed

255
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:20,960
in a in a single dimension

256
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,160
you need a multi-dimensional review in

257
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,198
your organization

258
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,160
and this assessment needs to be dynamic

259
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,680
not static a static risk assessment

260
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,080
looking at the organization

261
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,719
in a single dimension in a single

262
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,919
element

263
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,560
is not going to produce a context for

264
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,519
the security of the overall organization

265
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,559
and this is where

266
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,159
they called dynamic testing comes in you

267
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,119
need to profile the organization

268
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,120
extensively

269
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,800
identify the attack factors that might

270
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,800
be attacking your organization

271
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,479
determine your susceptibility to those

272
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,800
vectors understand

273
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,880
what the response you would have and

274
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,519
expect against the stimulus

275
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,200
of an attack and of course you have to

276
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,920
be able to

277
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,000
change your approach on the fly based on

278
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,000
the way that the organization responds

279
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,680
this will provide the most relevant

280
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,760
information to your business

281
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,680
to help you manage the risk of the

282
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:15,600
context in which you operate

283
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,839
now look back at the apra requirements

284
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,320
for example remember they say that you

285
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,560
have to

286
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,480
test the control effectiveness of the

287
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:25,359
controls that you've got in place

288
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,880
now some people might be asking why we

289
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,880
bought all the technology

290
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,240
look at this organization they hired a

291
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,920
security guard now

292
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,680
is the security guard actually going to

293
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,040
identify any issues

294
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,719
for the pr from the people that are

295
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,800
coming into this premises

296
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,240
i don't think so what you really have to

297
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,319
do is understand

298
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,360
all the risks in your environment you've

299
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,920
got to understand

300
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,200
the cumulative effect of the risks not

301
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,040
risks in isolation

302
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,360
and of course you've got to be able to

303
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:53,279
identify interconnected risks

304
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,640
not treating all risks in a linear

305
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,040
manner so

306
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,640
with that let's look at a case study of

307
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,199
an owner and operator

308
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,560
of a critical infrastructure we've

309
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,720
conducted this assessment

310
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,640
and are able to provide some great

311
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,720
learnings to the audience today

312
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,760
this is actually really timely to uh to

313
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,440
discuss at the moment

314
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,439
the australian government is in the

315
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,360
process of refining

316
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,279
the requirements for protecting critical

317
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,360
infrastructure and systems of

318
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,720
national significance they released a

319
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,440
consultation paper

320
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,399
in august 2020 and now at the 17th of

321
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,040
september

322
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,839
the the consultation process has just

323
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,719
ended

324
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,800
this particular paper identified the

325
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,240
opportunity for the government to expand

326
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:38,240
the definition of uh what constitutes

327
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,920
critical infrastructure or systems of

328
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,560
national significance in the australian

329
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,000
market

330
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,839
now if you look on the right hand side

331
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,720
over here there are a huge number of

332
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,880
industries

333
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,800
which the net would now effectively

334
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,079
capture so if you're thinking today that

335
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,760
your organization

336
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,920
wasn't considered critical

337
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,079
infrastructure that may change

338
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,599
very soon particularly where you

339
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,239
identify something such as

340
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,440
data and the cloud which affects almost

341
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,399
every business

342
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,680
today now if we look at the obligations

343
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,920
that the organizations

344
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:12,719
have in defeating and defending uh

345
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,439
systems of critical importance to the to

346
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,600
the

347
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,279
australian public there are particular

348
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,600
requirements that have to be met

349
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,480
in particular they identify that you

350
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,120
need to take an

351
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,399
all hazards approach in identifying and

352
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:27,519
understanding risks

353
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,160
remember an all hazards approach on a

354
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,160
desktop

355
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,160
exercise further they say that the

356
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,120
organization has to have appropriate

357
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,240
risk management

358
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,640
including evaluation and testing but the

359
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,720
tests must identify the outcomes

360
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,480
of security this means that you cannot

361
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,440
rely extensively

362
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,320
on desktop exercises alone you have to

363
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,440
conduct

364
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,760
online dynamic tests to identify

365
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,959
all the risks that you are subjected to

366
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,959
now let's look at our

367
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,079
case study organization they know

368
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,719
different to most

369
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:59,279
they've got an office in the city

370
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,519
they've got

371
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,200
an outsourced contact center they've got

372
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,079
an open plan office where people come

373
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,639
into the office

374
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,920
and conduct their business they also

375
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,760
have data centers

376
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,599
in this case they're not using cloud

377
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,560
extensively critical infrastructure

378
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,800
they've got a number of

379
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:18,079
on-premise data centers they've also

380
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,160
invested in a very expensive 24x7 sock

381
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,760
monitoring service they've got good

382
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,240
physical security

383
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,240
in the foyer of their building they've

384
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,000
also got good physical security to get

385
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,519
into the tenancy themselves

386
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,760
now this organization has been in

387
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:35,040
business for a long period of time

388
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,000
in fact iso 27001 compliant and they've

389
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,920
got a risk

390
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,519
management framework implemented as you

391
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,599
can see over here

392
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:43,360
they do identify risks they evaluate

393
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:45,839
risks and they treat those risks

394
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,760
this is all part of the isms the

395
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:51,200
information security management system

396
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:52,399
or iso 27001 now while this organization

397
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,399
was pretty confident

398
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:59,240
about their iso 27001 security posture

399
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,720
they appointed us to conduct a

400
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,200
goal-oriented

401
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,560
risk assessment we also call this a red

402
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,720
team penetration test

403
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,040
now red team penetration testing the

404
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,800
terminology can sound pretty confronting

405
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,959
so if you don't want to use confronting

406
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:15,359
terminology your organization

407
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,399
call it a goal-oriented risk assessment

408
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,480
and you might be able to get your

409
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,760
security review across the line

410
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:26,160
in this case our client appointed us to

411
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:28,880
achieve a number of particular um

412
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:30,639
goals within the assessment number one

413
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,560
to gain access to their network

414
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,959
then compromise their microsoft active

415
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:37,040
directory domain then locate

416
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:39,920
access and exfiltrate the primary data

417
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,480
assets gain access to their tls private

418
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,279
keys

419
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,920
and ultimately compromise the isolated

420
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,519
system

421
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,519
which was responsible for delivering

422
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,639
critical services and this was deep

423
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,120
within their network

424
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,839
and not publicly accessible at all our

425
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,160
approach

426
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,600
we had to perform reconnaissance we had

427
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,360
to identify

428
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,279
all of the the footprint that this

429
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,320
organization had

430
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,600
on online we then needed to identify and

431
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,079
craft some attacks

432
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,959
ultimately with the goal of having

433
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,359
persistent

434
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,319
remote access into the environment and

435
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,880
then achieve

436
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,079
each one of those five goals so if we

437
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,320
talk about reconnaissance

438
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,279
how did we conduct this firstly we would

439
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,760
be able to

440
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:20,880
enumerate the entire external perimeter

441
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,800
as much as possible

442
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,480
identifying the organization's domain

443
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,479
names dns records

444
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,079
ip address space all of their service

445
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,399
providers that they engage with

446
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:31,680
we can then start crafting a

447
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,240
multi-threaded

448
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,120
attack plan to identify the weakest

449
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,199
areas

450
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,560
of course people are known to be pretty

451
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,399
weak so we perform

452
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,920
intelligence gathering on as many

453
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:43,600
employees as possible

454
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,959
now of course the organization has a

455
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,639
number of physical

456
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,160
tendencies they've got an office in the

457
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,120
city they've got data centers where

458
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,040
their data restored

459
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,639
they probably have some remote sites as

460
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,959
well and of course

461
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,720
sometimes electronic signals emanate

462
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,518
beyond the physical boundaries of the

463
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,639
tenancy such as wireless networking

464
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,720
which is normally

465
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,079
a good way to get into a corporate

466
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,399
environment if it isn't

467
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,279
secured well now as part of our security

468
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,959
review and

469
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,120
profiling we identified that the

470
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:14,160
organization had their email

471
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,880
online on office 365. that's very common

472
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,120
these days

473
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,120
and in fact that implemented security

474
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,440
pretty well in office 365

475
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,880
implementing multi-factor authentication

476
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,160
or user-based

477
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,040
remote access however microsoft

478
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,920
office 365 is a very

479
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,439
configuration-centric platform

480
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,519
and they have not implemented

481
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:36,000
multi-factor authentication on

482
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,199
all of the remote access interfaces

483
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,399
particularly

484
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:41,279
powershell administrative interface with

485
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:44,639
access to this

486
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,199
we were able to conduct a password

487
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,240
spraying

488
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:50,719
attack against the exposed interfaces

489
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,360
we were able to identify a number of

490
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,600
accounts

491
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:56,000
which the passwords were weak probably

492
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,320
because they were defined once

493
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,839
at uh account creation person never

494
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,399
joined the organization for whatever

495
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,240
reason

496
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,680
and the password was never changed at

497
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:06,320
this point we had

498
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,719
uh had the opportunity to gain access to

499
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,240
the organization remotely however

500
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,680
we were then prompted with the

501
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,880
organization's multi-factor

502
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,920
authentication

503
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,959
but being inquisitive people we weren't

504
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,040
going to stop there

505
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:21,119
multi-factor authentication is strong

506
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,599
however configuration

507
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,160
is where is normally the things get let

508
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,040
down

509
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:29,360
and this wasn't an exception over here

510
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,920
this organization allowed us to

511
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,399
install a local copy of outlook which we

512
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,800
did

513
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,079
and if you look at the local of the

514
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,319
local configuration

515
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,199
they did not restrict your ability to

516
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,000
enroll

517
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:43,920
an alternative phone number in order to

518
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,399
get the multi-factor authentication

519
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,599
code so in this case instead of using

520
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:50,240
the defined

521
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,800
phone number we put our office phone

522
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:53,279
number

523
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,479
in as the method to actually get the mfa

524
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,519
code you see

525
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,160
we weren't actually bypassing mfa here

526
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,440
we just enrolled ourselves into the mfa

527
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,199
and then used that mfa

528
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,520
to get access to the organization

529
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:08,399
remember multi-factor authentication

530
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,359
is strong however it is only as good as

531
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,679
it is configured

532
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,719
and configuration is normally where

533
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,199
people can get in

534
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,760
and bypass security controls so with

535
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,839
this

536
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,199
we're able to get an mfa code and be

537
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:22,159
able to load up

538
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,799
the outlook client and ultimately get

539
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,640
access

540
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:29,200
into the office 365. however office 365

541
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:31,039
being a cloud environment did not enable

542
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,679
us to get access into the corporate

543
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,600
environment

544
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,600
and remember most of the goals are deep

545
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,320
within this organization's corporate

546
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,280
environment

547
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,918
however having access to the office 365

548
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,160
environment

549
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:44,000
is very useful because it can help you

550
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,360
to craft email attacks

551
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,640
and potentially uh further your um

552
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,918
phishing and um and attacks against

553
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,600
people because you've got access

554
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,679
directly to the systems

555
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,879
in which they're using to communicate

556
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,520
with each other

557
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,080
this organization again because they

558
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:03,360
were

559
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,720
pretty well established did not have

560
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,879
any vulnerabilities that we could

561
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,600
exploit in their wireless networking

562
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,120
so that angle did not work of course

563
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,639
their people also

564
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,399
were pretty um resilient against attack

565
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,080
our social engineering attacks which

566
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,679
normally work in our

567
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,520
phishing attacks which would also

568
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,120
normally work did not work

569
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,639
in this case again because the

570
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,439
organization and it was actually quite

571
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,080
diligent

572
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,880
in implementing good education within

573
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,678
the business

574
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,799
however just a quick tip to the to the

575
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,640
listeners today

576
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,480
if you want to get good at hacking i

577
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:40,240
suggest that you take up smoking

578
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,520
why because if you actually spend a

579
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,760
little bit of time

580
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,559
staking out the organization you can

581
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,640
become

582
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,600
friendly with the smokers who normally

583
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,760
go down to the

584
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,520
uh the street level to have their smoke

585
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,600
breaks and over a period of days

586
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,360
can actually strike up a friendship this

587
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,399
then gives you the opportunity

588
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:01,280
to leverage that

589
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:02,559
that friendship and actually exploit it

590
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,918
for the benefit of getting into the

591
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:05,840
corporate tenancy

592
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,200
so if you follow the smokers you can

593
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,199
normally go up in this in

594
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,320
in the lift and enter into the office at

595
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,160
the same time as them

596
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,678
essentially tailgating into the

597
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,160
organization

598
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,360
at this point once you've got tailgated

599
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:19,360
into the organization

600
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,039
what we want to do is implement one of

601
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,520
these technical devices

602
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:24,480
called a land turtle a land turtle is a

603
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,160
small device

604
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,840
which will plug into the usb port of a

605
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,880
computer and also

606
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,439
has got access to the 3g network

607
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,039
remote access and you plug the ethernet

608
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,360
of the company's corporate domain

609
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,960
to the other interface now we tried to

610
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,719
do this in this organization

611
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,400
again they had many security controls

612
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,679
for example network

613
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,000
access control mac which prevented us

614
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,960
bringing in foreign devices into the

615
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,520
environment

616
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,960
well that attack vector didn't work but

617
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,600
snooping around the office

618
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,919
we were able to find the it room now in

619
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,120
the it room this is where technicians

620
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:02,799
get the computers ready uh for

621
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,280
deployment for new users

622
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:07,120
or they perform repairs on computers

623
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,918
that need to be fixed

624
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,719
now in this case because the all the the

625
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,559
technicians

626
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,919
need to get the computers on the network

627
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:16,000
and patched this is an

628
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,120
area in the environment where network

629
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,200
access control

630
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,039
is whitelisted this gave us the

631
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:24,240
opportunity to install

632
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:27,679
our land turtle directly in

633
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,720
an area which was visible to technicians

634
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,679
but was able to be in this case hidden

635
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,600
in plain sight

636
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,520
we just put a sticker on it that said do

637
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,719
not remove plug the device into the

638
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,120
corporate network

639
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,559
and also have the 3g remote access back

640
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,559
channel back to our office

641
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,720
and with this we had achieved goal

642
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,760
number one we were able to access the

643
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,240
corporate network

644
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,799
now while we were in that it room we

645
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,200
found

646
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:52,720
a desktop computer we also found that

647
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:55,760
the security controls

648
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:57,840
were not consistently applied laptop

649
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:01,520
computers in this organization

650
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,840
did have a full disk encryption

651
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,760
which means that we couldn't decrypt the

652
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,799
hard drive of a laptop computer

653
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,080
however desktop computers did not have

654
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,879
full disk encryption

655
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,240
this is a common mistake all computers

656
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,799
in organizations

657
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,080
should use full disk encryption so what

658
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,480
we were able to do

659
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,120
was boot an alternative linux operating

660
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,400
system

661
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:28,239
on a desktop computer and then access

662
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,400
the accounts that were used to

663
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:32,320
to access this computer in the past of

664
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,400
course the system administrator

665
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,520
was logging in as the domain

666
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,760
administrator

667
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:40,240
this gave us the opportunity to crack

668
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,640
the domain admin password offline

669
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,559
and with this we were then able to bind

670
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,840
to the genuine active directory

671
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,480
server in the organization the domain

672
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,520
every

673
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:55,120
domain administrator privileged access

674
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:57,360
and pull out the entire list of users

675
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,959
in the environment we can use tools such

676
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,439
as memicats to do this

677
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,320
we could then take the time to crack all

678
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,360
the passwords

679
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,600
offline this took a couple of days

680
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,399
while we had uh remote access to the

681
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,480
environment

682
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,520
we were then able to finish the attack

683
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,400
and compromise

684
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:16,240
the entire domain this allowed us to

685
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,760
achieve goal number two

686
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,520
now we needed to snoop around the

687
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,000
environment trying to get further and

688
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,158
further

689
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,840
to achieve our other goals we found a

690
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,200
file server in this environment and of

691
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,678
course being a very diligent

692
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,559
organization they were storing a lot of

693
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,640
information

694
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,559
unfortunately there were no role-based

695
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,919
access controls in the file server

696
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,080
which means that a lot of sensitive

697
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:37,919
information was generally available

698
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,639
to anybody who could get access to the

699
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,960
file server now remember at this point

700
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,559
we were actually still using a domain

701
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,919
administrative credential

702
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:47,600
we probably shouldn't have been because

703
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:50,080
we had we had uh

704
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,959
compromised all of the user credentials

705
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,720
in the environment

706
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,640
but at this point we still were using

707
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,440
the domain administrative credential

708
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,320
to actually traverse the file server and

709
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,960
at this time

710
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,600
this expensive 24x7 stock offering

711
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,320
should have

712
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,760
identified that domain privileged

713
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,280
credentials were being used for

714
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,640
non-domain

715
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,799
privileged access requirements however

716
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,320
they were asleep at the wheel and did

717
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,918
nothing

718
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,720
now this organization again as i've

719
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:21,520
mentioned at isa 27001 compliance

720
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,000
part of this requires good practices

721
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:25,039
around

722
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,159
change and change management and access

723
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,960
control management

724
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:30,159
and they very diligently filled in a lot

725
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:32,480
of information about

726
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:34,240
access into the core data environment

727
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,400
when they had upgraded the system

728
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,720
now we could use this information to our

729
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,960
advantage because we knew the user

730
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,760
who was the assigned administrator for

731
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,760
that system

732
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,960
and we knew the target ip address of

733
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,000
where that system was

734
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:50,240
on the network now unfortunately

735
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,760
this administrator was doing what we

736
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,400
call password

737
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:56,080
reuse for the for convenience this

738
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,919
administrator was using the same

739
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:02,158
active directory password as password to

740
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:04,320
access the system which was not

741
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,559
connected to the directory

742
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,120
so with a password reuse attack because

743
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:12,559
we had compromised the entire domain

744
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:15,439
we then were able to use that credential

745
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,158
to access critical server and at this

746
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,600
point

747
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:22,240
we then extracted all of the data from

748
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,158
the system now of course this data was

749
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,200
still encrypted because i remember the

750
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,080
organization

751
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,919
had quite diligently implemented a lot

752
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:33,039
of security controls

753
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:35,440
now how do you decrypt the data

754
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,080
if the data is encrypted well you have

755
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,080
to find

756
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,158
a decryption key but remember our

757
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,879
administrator was logging in as domain

758
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,039
administrator

759
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,640
we had the domain admin credential we

760
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:48,400
were able to find

761
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:51,120
the online enterprise grade web-based

762
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,679
internal password vault and within this

763
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:54,879
password

764
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:57,039
word vault we were able to find the keys

765
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,080
that were used to encrypt the data and

766
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,158
that same key

767
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:01,439
to encrypt the data could be used to

768
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,000
decrypt the data

769
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,200
because it was symmetric key encryption

770
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,720
and decryption

771
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,720
now remember about the guy the security

772
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,240
guard that's not really doing very much

773
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,240
the same thing was happening with the

774
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,200
sock at this time

775
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,919
this particular product was producing

776
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:21,360
alerts

777
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:23,919
on privileged access credential requests

778
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,039
so every time we were requesting access

779
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,159
to credentials

780
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:29,440
such as the encryption keys or the

781
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,559
decryption keys

782
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:36,000
it generates an alert but the

783
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:38,879
24x7 sock was asleep at the wheel

784
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,440
again and as we extracted the data key

785
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,039
the

786
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:46,000
24x7 stock raised no alert at all

787
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,799
to our attack and with this we were able

788
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,360
to achieve

789
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:50,000
goal number three we were able to locate

790
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,399
access

791
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
and exfiltrate the primary data assets

792
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,159
and decrypt it

793
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,960
on to the next task we needed to gain

794
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,720
access to the tls private keys

795
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,799
now for those who know a bit about

796
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,720
private public key encryption

797
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:06,158
there are two different keys not like

798
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,320
symmetric encryption

799
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,400
this is there is a public key and a

800
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,600
private key and the private key

801
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,400
is essential to remain private and

802
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,360
secret

803
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,559
because that data can only be decrypted

804
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,639
by the pair

805
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,320
by the paired key for which you need to

806
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,120
have the public and private key

807
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,720
together now in this case where would

808
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,799
you find the private keys

809
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,840
well we went to the file server and

810
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,639
found a folder

811
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,080
called keys now of course the

812
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,760
organization being diligent

813
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,399
didn't just leave their private keys

814
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,279
there alone they had put a pass phrase

815
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,960
in fact

816
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,880
quite a long and strong complex

817
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,120
passphrase but

818
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,720
which protected the key itself so

819
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,639
getting the private key alone

820
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,159
did not allow you to exploit it because

821
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,720
you had to get a passphrase

822
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,960
to unlock the private key but remember

823
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:56,960
we had access to this online system

824
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,720
and remember it was generating logs that

825
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,360
the soft provider wasn't doing anything

826
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,679
about it

827
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,559
but we were able to find the passphrase

828
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,720
to decrypt

829
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,760
the private keys and with that we were

830
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,559
able to access

831
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,320
the private keys for the not only the

832
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,360
administrative website that they used to

833
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,439
configure their system

834
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:14,559
but also the critical infrastructure

835
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,120
website and

836
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,840
as a bonus we were also able to access

837
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,600
the tls

838
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,520
private key for the network access

839
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,520
control system now with this

840
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,879
we were able to actually white list our

841
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,039
own um

842
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,880
ips and mac addresses and devices so

843
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:30,559
that we could maintain persistence

844
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,080
in their environment anywhere in the

845
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:35,600
corporate environment not just the i.t

846
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,520
technical room where they were doing

847
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,158
computer repairs so we could enroll

848
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,918
ourselves

849
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,600
into the network access control and

850
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,760
maintain persistence forever

851
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,600
essentially in their environment and

852
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,679
with this we had achieved

853
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,959
goal number four now goal number five

854
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:51,039
was quite complicated

855
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,240
we had to compromise the very critical

856
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:55,039
system that was deep

857
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,039
within their environment now if you're

858
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,440
familiar with the terminology defense in

859
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,520
depth

860
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:00,640
this is just a sample example it's not

861
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:03,840
the exact example

862
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,880
of our client environment the idea of

863
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,559
defense in depth

864
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:08,000
is that you've got multiple layers of

865
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,440
controls to get to

866
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,200
a sensitive system deep within the

867
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,080
network and you've essentially got a

868
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,000
zigzag

869
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,199
your way across the environment to

870
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,640
ultimately get

871
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:21,120
to your system that you need to

872
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:22,960
target and attack now we were able to

873
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,760
get a blueprint of the environment

874
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,279
because again

875
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,120
the information was published on their

876
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:29,360
file server with little to no

877
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,239
access controls restricting access to

878
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,520
the information

879
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,279
and while that should have raised an

880
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,600
alert the sock was

881
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:37,679
no none the wiser to us traversing the

882
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,399
network or getting documentation out

883
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,799
about

884
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,479
how the environment was set up to make

885
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:45,520
things a little bit more complicated

886
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:48,640
there was a vpn between firewalls

887
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:50,879
not a public vpn and internal vpn

888
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,679
but the user credentials to use the vpn

889
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,200
to traverse

890
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,919
to get into the sensitive part of the

891
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,320
network was bound into active directory

892
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:59,360
now remember we had compromised the

893
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,360
active directory

894
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,959
so we had the credentials to be able to

895
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:04,320
create a vpn

896
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,559
what would have been better at this

897
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,840
point was if the organization had used

898
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,879
multi-factor authentication to initiate

899
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,039
the vpn

900
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,799
however it probably would have just

901
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,279
added a little bit of time to our attack

902
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:17,200
because

903
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,880
since we were domain administrators we

904
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,080
could have enrolled ourselves

905
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,600
as um into the mfa system

906
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,158
and ultimately would have been able to

907
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,439
get into the vpn as well it just would

908
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:30,159
have added some cost

909
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,240
to our attack so at this point we were

910
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,399
able to find the ultimate server

911
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,279
which ran the critical infrastructure

912
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:38,239
now this server

913
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,360
was not on the domain it was hosted

914
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,919
independently

915
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,279
and added independent username and

916
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,080
password

917
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:48,000
but and it was also not pass subject to

918
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,879
password reuse we found we tried

919
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,600
all of the domain um passwords that we

920
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,279
could

921
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:55,120
but what we did find was that there was

922
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:57,840
a local password database

923
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,479
not the centralized online web password

924
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,360
database

925
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:02,000
but an independent encrypted file

926
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,479
however

927
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,520
it was strongly secured and encrypted

928
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,000
and we could not

929
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,200
crack that password safe in a reasonable

930
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,360
period of time

931
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,640
however we did find what's called a

932
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,320
roaming profile

933
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,080
for the administrator now a roaming

934
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,240
profile is a directory

935
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,120
in active directory that allows the

936
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,120
administrator

937
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,320
to have a consistent look and feel no

938
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,320
matter where they are

939
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,918
in the corporate environment because

940
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:28,720
they the profile

941
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,399
environmental profile roams with you as

942
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,640
you move around the environment

943
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:34,320
now in this roaming profile we were able

944
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:37,760
to find what is called

945
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:40,960
the firefox online credential cache

946
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:44,000
now of course rule number one guys never

947
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,159
ever put your password into a browser

948
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
and allow the browser to remember it

949
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:50,240
it's great for convenience but it's

950
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,159
really really bad for security

951
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,520
most of these tools do not have good

952
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:55,440
security protocols

953
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,360
for protecting credentials within the

954
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:00,960
browser we were able to find a

955
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,959
vulnerability in the firefox

956
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:05,678
product and we're able to actually crack

957
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,279
the passwords

958
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:11,120
in that were on that particular device

959
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,320
now this administrator unfortunately had

960
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,199
saved his credentials

961
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,600
in that firefox password safe and with

962
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,840
that

963
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:19,279
we were able to get elevated

964
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:22,000
administrative privileges

965
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,640
directly into the ultimate critical

966
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,960
system

967
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,320
deep within their network and with that

968
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,120
we had achieved

969
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:30,639
all of the goals now we call this a

970
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,399
living off the land attack

971
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,399
because all goals were achieved without

972
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:37,918
exploiting any vulnerabilities

973
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:39,279
we just used the tools that were on the

974
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:43,600
operating systems

975
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:45,519
to actually move navigate our way

976
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,799
horizontally and vertically vertically

977
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,880
within the environment

978
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,399
we did not bring any tools into the

979
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,760
environment we did not run any

980
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:54,080
vulnerability scans

981
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,039
we did not identify any vulnerabilities

982
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,840
in the environment

983
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:58,879
that could be exploited it all arose

984
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,039
from getting physical

985
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,720
access into the environment and getting

986
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:05,200
a device onto the network

987
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,720
and from there we were able to move and

988
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,600
control the entire attack

989
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,440
remotely now this organization remember

990
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,158
had a number of good security controls

991
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,360
in place

992
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:17,519
they were iso 27001 compliant they did

993
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,519
have good network access controls

994
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,720
they did outsource their security

995
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,679
monitoring to

996
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,559
an external party they had technology

997
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:26,880
galore

998
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:27,600
they had firewalls vpn vulnerability

999
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,519
management

1000
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,959
anti-malware every sort of endpoint

1001
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,159
software you can think of

1002
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,240
they did have multi-factor

1003
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,440
authentication on remote access

1004
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,519
they did have multi-factor

1005
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,559
authentication on email they did have

1006
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,080
strong passwords

1007
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,840
they did have a password vault they

1008
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,918
weren't storing their passwords in an

1009
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:45,918
excel file on a file server

1010
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,440
and they did have good privileged access

1011
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,799
management controls but they weren't

1012
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,880
monitoring them properly

1013
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,799
they did have good physical security

1014
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:55,279
controls in the office

1015
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,240
environments however they were let down

1016
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,399
by a few things

1017
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:59,679
number one we were able to get physical

1018
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:01,918
access to the office

1019
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:03,200
by becoming friendly with the smokers

1020
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,000
and ensuring that we could actually

1021
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:06,559
tailgate

1022
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:08,000
into the office they had assumed that

1023
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:09,200
they had good security controls in

1024
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,039
office 365

1025
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,960
but we were able to bypass them because

1026
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:16,480
they never tested themselves

1027
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,240
their mfa was not correctly configured

1028
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,760
they were using privileged access

1029
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,360
credentials to do

1030
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:24,158
maintenance jobs which they shouldn't

1031
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:27,199
have and we're able to exploit that

1032
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,960
and remember that they didn't have good

1033
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,760
bios security because they were not

1034
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,840
consistently implementing

1035
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,440
full disk encryption on desktop

1036
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,360
computers and laptops

1037
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,039
and of course they were doing that

1038
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,360
number one cardinal sin

1039
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:42,320
password reuse that will get you every

1040
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,240
single time

1041
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,760
ensure that you don't reuse your

1042
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:47,519
passwords across systems

1043
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:49,440
you always have to have an independent

1044
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:52,320
unique long and strong password

1045
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,799
for every single system that you use and

1046
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,399
of course

1047
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:56,639
once the domain is compromised

1048
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:58,799
everything fell like falling dominoes

1049
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,279
and of course unfortunately that very

1050
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:03,360
expensive 24x7 secops provider

1051
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,399
was asleep at the wheel they might have

1052
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,719
been getting alerts

1053
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,760
but they required manual intervention it

1054
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,760
wasn't automated

1055
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,960
and manual intervention is normally

1056
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,399
where things go wrong

1057
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,839
because people actually can't identify

1058
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:17,279
and respond to the threats

1059
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,359
in the speed at the speed at which they

1060
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,800
need to and of course they had a lot of

1061
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:21,359
sensitive information on their file

1062
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,440
server

1063
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:25,839
the information was good and consistent

1064
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,879
with the iso 27001 requirements to

1065
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,040
document everything

1066
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,319
but they did not put role-based access

1067
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,440
controls they did not

1068
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:34,240
encrypt that data or prevent access into

1069
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,520
that data

1070
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:39,118
only for particular users so we were

1071
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,800
able to find all the information about

1072
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,200
the systems that we needed

1073
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,240
now remember this organization did have

1074
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,839
good risk management

1075
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:48,479
and they were doing assessments like

1076
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:51,119
this one over here but the problem

1077
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,000
with a spreadsheet or desktop-based risk

1078
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:55,359
assessment

1079
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,440
is that it is linear and static

1080
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,960
what you need to do for this organ for

1081
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,640
an organization like this

1082
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:05,599
is consider the security

1083
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,598
of the organization in the context in

1084
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:11,040
which the organization operates

1085
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,599
not within isolation isolation looks at

1086
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,560
each

1087
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,000
security issue on its own but remember

1088
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,119
the organization is an

1089
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,800
ecosystem of security technologies

1090
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:25,280
and an ecosystem of systems therefore

1091
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,400
a secu looking at something in isolation

1092
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,599
is not going to give you the full

1093
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,440
picture

1094
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,520
remember this organization had no

1095
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,800
vulnerabilities they were diligently

1096
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,400
patching everything

1097
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,560
they were really actually good on their

1098
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,240
security operational tasks

1099
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,480
we didn't actually have to compromise

1100
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,919
any vulnerabilities because we just used

1101
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,920
the systems that were native

1102
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,119
in the environment as i demonstrated to

1103
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:47,280
move horizontally

1104
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,280
and vertically within the business

1105
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:51,520
therefore what this demonstrates

1106
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,640
is the requirement to assess your risks

1107
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:54,960
dynamically

1108
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:56,480
now a dynamic risk assessment is another

1109
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:59,599
way of calling

1110
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:00,640
a red team penetration test a red team

1111
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,640
penetration test

1112
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,920
as we've indicated over here is a

1113
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:07,598
multi-threaded

1114
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:10,160
parallel goal oriented security review

1115
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,960
if the term penetration testing or red

1116
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,720
team testing

1117
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,880
is a little confronting for your

1118
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,520
organization call it a dynamic risk

1119
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,119
assessment

1120
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:19,119
and it's more likely to get across the

1121
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,440
line now if you don't want to look at

1122
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,359
this

1123
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,359
only from the perspective of the

1124
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,319
attacker you can look at this from the

1125
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:27,200
perspective

1126
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,560
of the defender as well this is called a

1127
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,160
blue team assessment

1128
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:31,839
now in this case this organization

1129
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,799
really didn't need some blue teaming

1130
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:36,480
because they were idea they were logging

1131
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:38,240
and producing alerts on a number of

1132
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,800
activities but they just weren't acting

1133
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,720
on them

1134
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,880
and that's because they probably hadn't

1135
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,520
tuned their systems and had never

1136
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:46,400
actually bothered to test the scenarios

1137
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,440
against which

1138
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:52,240
the systems were implemented to secure

1139
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,400
and when you blend a red team assessment

1140
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:55,118
with a blue team assessment you get what

1141
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,800
we call a

1142
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,240
purple team assessment those are the

1143
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,920
blended colors together

1144
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,279
that's where you look at things from

1145
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,599
both the attackers

1146
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:05,119
and defenders perspective and that's

1147
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:08,560
ultimately where i recommend

1148
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:10,400
that you get to in your organization

1149
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,799
with this let's just tell a quick

1150
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,040
summary three quick takeaways

1151
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,640
number one cyber risk assessments

1152
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,800
require context

1153
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:20,000
you need to understand your environment

1154
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:22,079
your business systems

1155
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,359
and the attack factors that are likely

1156
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,240
apply to you

1157
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:26,960
specifically do not rely on just doing

1158
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,598
things

1159
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,640
um in a generic manner as a desktop

1160
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,640
assessment

1161
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:34,879
a risk assessment is really only as good

1162
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:36,640
as the scope of what you're looking at

1163
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,960
choosing a narrow scope will only

1164
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,680
protect you against a subset of possible

1165
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,440
threats

1166
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:43,598
you really need to look at all of the

1167
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:45,520
threats and ask the right questions

1168
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:47,520
not just a bunch of questions that come

1169
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:49,680
with a spreadsheet remember

1170
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,720
you have to apply the risk assessment to

1171
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,839
the context

1172
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:55,759
for the organization and the context

1173
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:57,839
for the environment in which you operate

1174
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,119
in and attacks generally exploit

1175
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,520
technical weaknesses

1176
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:03,280
and people buying technology doesn't fix

1177
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,359
this most of the issues

1178
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,400
relate to configuration and

1179
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,480
implementation

1180
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,720
and ongoing management so there is an

1181
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,880
element of configuration management

1182
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,000
that needs to be secured and of course

1183
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:17,040
people in general

1184
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,680
are the weak link now you need to ensure

1185
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,480
that there is adequate ongoing cyber

1186
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,118
security

1187
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:24,240
education and therefore cyber security

1188
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,320
literary

1189
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:28,319
within the business and that requires

1190
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:30,480
what we call boardroom to basement

1191
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:31,599
security education approaches you need

1192
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,280
to have everybody

1193
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,520
cyber literate in your business to

1194
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:37,119
develop cybersecure workforce

1195
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,560
that you need to ensure that your

1196
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:40,240
business is resilient

1197
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,839
you need this at the board level you

1198
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,759
need this at the executive level

1199
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:46,000
you need it at an administrative level

1200
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,000
you need it at a development level

1201
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,920
and you need it at a functional level

1202
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,480
