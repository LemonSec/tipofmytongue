1
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,040
good morning and welcome to ossa 2020

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,719
day two

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,240
just uh to remind everyone of the

4
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,480
general housekeeping if you have any

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,000
issues with the platform just um

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,759
make sure you're not using chrome to

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,039
start with and refresh your browser if

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,480
the video freezes

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,920
it's a pretty common problem that people

10
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,480
seem to have been having but hopefully

11
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,119
it doesn't

12
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,560
persist too badly today our first

13
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,198
session this morning is a pre-recorded

14
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,198
session

15
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,800
but there will be a live q a at the end

16
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,359
of

17
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,120
make sure you actually use the q a panel

18
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,160
and uh i guess to go from there first of

19
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,360

20
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,800
tell everybody if you don't already know

21
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,440

that's brook security in brisbane and

24
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,360

25
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,039

26

queensland and previously has been

28
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,879
in many roles as an intelligence analyst

29
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,760
and all over the place and there's an

30
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,239
ex-colleague of mine

31
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,039
absolutely wonderful person and she'll

32
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,519
be talking

33
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:01,680
today about cybercrime and all of the uh

34
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,359
fun and games that come along with it

35
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,920
anyway let's uh have a look at mandy's

36
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,680
presentation

37
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,960
in keeping with the we can be heroes

38
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,520
conference theme

39
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,880
i welcome you to this superhero comic

40
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,479
inspired presentation on cybercrime

41
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,320
and while i'm sure that there will be

42
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,159
some of you who say i've heard all this

43
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,919
information before this is nothing new

44
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,040
this isn't technical

45
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,040
i want to pose a question to you if

46
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,360
everybody already knows all this

47
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,920
information and implies this information

48
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,759
every day why is cybercrime still a

49
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,000
problem

50
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,520
i truly believe we need to think outside

51
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,840
the box and in this case

52
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,200
the comic book borders and think about

53
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,320
our responsibilities

54
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,479
as end users of technology

55
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,720
and what we can all do to become

56
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:51,200
cybercrime fighting superheroes

57
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,158
and what we can all do to help others

58
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,680
fight cybercrime

59
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,759
me in my comic book adventure

60
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,759
what's a good comic without an inside

61
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,920
this issue page

62
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,920
so in our comic book we're going to look

63
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,239
at common cyber crime types impacting

64
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,239
australians at the moment

65
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,319
and obviously there will be some covert

66
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,560
19 theme scams in there

67
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:17,040
but look at who commits cybercrime is it

68
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,599
a hacker in a hoodie

69
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,959
we'll discuss why there is no solely

70
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,799
technical solution

71
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,720
and look at why people are still falling

72
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,440
victim to cyber crime

73
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,359
and of course how everyone can be

74
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,359
cybercrime fighting superheroes

75
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,160
so the hoodie wearing hacker

76
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,720
let's stop for a moment and have a think

77
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,720
about that

78
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,000
is there a super villain in a hoodie

79
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,238
hacking you right now let's leave the

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,560
hoodie wearing hackers to the movies

81
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,640
it's a really unhelpful image because it

82
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,159
can make people feel really hopeless and

83
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,279
fearful that this is

84
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,799
arch nemesis there that is a super

85
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,000
villain that knows all sorts of things

86
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,319
that they don't know that

87
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,360
they can never help themselves and never

88
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,640
support themselves

89
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,840
to be protected from this

90
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,559
what we need to ensure people understand

91
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,080
is that cyber crime is not perpetrated

92
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,280
by shadowy hooded

93
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:24,080
super villains but criminals

94
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:27,040
cybercrime is perpetrated by many

95
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,159
different types of people

96
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,798
cybercrime is big business

97
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,319
they're a huge organized criminal

98
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:37,200
businesses

99
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,159
that devote themselves to cyber crime

100
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,040
there are huge

101
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,120
organized criminal businesses that have

102
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,840
lots of different nefarious activities

103
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,319
going on

104
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,080
that help fund their projects with

105
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,280
cybercrime

106
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:55,040
cybercrime is big business there is no

107
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,040
super villain in a hoodie

108
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,720
cybercrime is an umbrella term and in

109
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,519
australia it can describe

110
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,480
crime both against technology and crime

111
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,480
enabled by it

112
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,040
cybercrime can run the gamut from

113
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,160
someone trying to make a political

114
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:21,279
statement for example in hacktivism

115
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,040
all the way down to cyber espionage huge

116
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:26,799
criminal organizations

117
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,840
mischief makers could be people that

118
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,720
are grooming young children so that they

119
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,039
can create

120
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,280
sell and transmit child exploitation or

121
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,240
child abuse material

122
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,039
cyber crime could be cyber bullying it

123
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,440
could be

124
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,759
investment scams there could be

125
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,560
unauthorized crypto miners on websites

126
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,800
that's also cybercrime and lately who

127
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,080
hasn't seen the zoom bombers

128
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,639
so cybercrime is huge it has all

129
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,240
different

130
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,639
types of crime activities but i don't

131
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,000
see

132
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,680
hoodie wearing hackers in that

133
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
the stereotype of the hoodie wearing

134
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,360
hacker is harmful

135
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,360
we really need to stop that

136
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,400
let's think about this as these are

137
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,759
criminals

138
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,758
perpetrating crimes

139
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,320
on this very colorful page of our comic

140
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:23,039
we can see that cybercrime refers to

141
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,039
all sorts of activities and they're all

142
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,840
extremely broad

143
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,520
just as i discussed in the other slide

144
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,119
there can be things such as child

145
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,639
exploitation material

146
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,880
there can be things such as cyber

147
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,080
bullying and all the types of cyber

148
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:39,199
crime

149
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,198
business email and invoice scams

150
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,360
phishing wishing and smishing because i

151
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,560
really like a good rhyme

152
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,199
spreading hate and sightings hate 419

153
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,280
scams

154
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,560
extortion scams you know when there's an

155
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,719
email that says

156
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:54,880
i've hacked your computer and i have you

157
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,240
on video doing something dodgy

158
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,000
and i'll prove that i've been in your

159
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,919
computer because i have your password

160
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,520
and they quote a password or an email

161
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:04,159
address or a phone number

162
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,520
that they have had from some data breach

163
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,600
years and years ago

164
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,560
to prove that they're in your computer

165
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,800
and then they say

166
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,400
if you pay me whatever the going rate in

167
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,440
bitcoin is these days

168
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,679
i won't send that compromising video to

169
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:21,680
your friends your family your boss

170
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:23,919
sex torsion scams website defacements

171
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,520
malware ransomware trojans keyloggers

172
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,159
whatever

173
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,000
child exploitation abuse material

174
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,319
identity theft that is also

175
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,280
a cybercrime matter romance scams denial

176
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,280
of service

177
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,159
and of course let's not forget tech

178
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,159
support scams

179
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,479
so what makes cybercrime successful so

180
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,840
if we're looking at

181
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,479
scams or criminals encouraging people to

182
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,679
download

183
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,440
bellwear for example what makes it so

184
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,840
successful

185
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,639
criminals are really really clever at

186
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,960
reading

187
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,759
and using situations and manipulating

188
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,000
people

189
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,160
they are like the con artists of old

190
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,880
that sold the eiffel tower to the

191
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,199
unsuspecting tourists

192
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,159
they are innovative and they just keep

193
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,240
evolving

194
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,919
but remember a lot of criminals behind

195
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,680
cybercrime are actually part of huge

196
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,318
businesses and these businesses hire

197
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,479
psychologists and they hire coders and

198
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,080
they hire all sorts of people which help

199
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,479
them innovate and evolve

200
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,479
and because their money is coming from

201
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,159
criminal activities they often have far

202
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,318
more money to spend on this

203
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,440
than we do so their research and

204
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,360
development

205
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,199
lots of money are research and

206
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,919
development not so much

207
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,599
so you can see why cyber crime is big

208
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,479
business and it's hard for us as good

209
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,479
guys to keep up

210
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,520
the europol stated that cybercrime in

211
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,160
fact is more profitable than the drug

212
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:52,560
trade

213
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,520
so it is huge criminals upgrade malware

214
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,440
change malware

215
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,198
they can improve it really really fast

216
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,199
and exploit vulnerabilities as soon as

217
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:01,440
they're found

218
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,520
it is really hard to keep your tech

219
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,800
configurations your patches and your

220
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,639
awareness campaigns up to date

221
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,120
particularly if your business or

222
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,199
organization or your school

223
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,560
has a very small budget like a lot of

224
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,160
people these days

225
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,919
and then they're going well we have an

226
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,560
awareness campaign that we bought three

227
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,240
years ago

228
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,680
that's all we can afford to use so

229
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,560
that's all we're going to do

230
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,680
that's going to be out of date and so

231
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,440
that is a real struggle

232
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,199
we also have an increased reliance on

233
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,680
internet and interconnectivity in our

234
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,360
world

235
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,000
everything we have is connected to the

236
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,080
internet we have several game consoles

237
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,880
at home they're all interconnected

238
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,560
the television is connected i know some

239
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,080
people that have their coffee pot

240
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:48,319
connected so we are reliant

241
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,839
very much on interconnectivity it is

242
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,519
very hard to escape

243
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:56,080
the cyberspace these days and then

244
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:57,839
there could be areas where children or

245
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,600
other vulnerable groups may lack

246
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,959
appropriate guidance about online

247
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,839
dangers

248
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,680
or may be in a position where they just

249
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,240
don't realize that something could be

250
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,719
dangerous online

251
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,160
criminals take advantage of distractions

252
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,360
they take advantage of human

253
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,000
distractions

254
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,279
particularly for example at the moment

255
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,279
the global pandemic

256
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:21,120
it is a massive distraction and

257
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,560
criminals are really taking advantage of

258
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:26,160
that

259
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:29,040
so if we look at email as a mechanism

260
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,000
to either fish for information or steal

261
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,279
information or

262
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,920
trick someone into paying an invoice or

263
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:38,399
trick someone to install malware if we

264
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,240
see look at email as a mechanism of this

265
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:43,920
cybercrime

266
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:47,519
what makes email so successful

267
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,360
as a vector for this

268
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,920
there are three things that that i can

269
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,040
really see and i often talk about

270
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,199
is that phishing or

271
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,480
tricking emails scamming emails are

272
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,640
believable

273
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,360
they play to emotions and the false

274
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,360
sense of security of the recipient

275
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:08,240
so they are believable because they

276
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:10,480
spoof trusted brands or trusted people

277
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,600
for example with the covert 19 there

278
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,079
have been emails that

279
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:15,519
that people have reported that say from

280
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:16,959
your hr department

281
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,279
important coming back to work

282
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:22,719
information covid19

283
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,680
that is believable it's about everyday

284
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,680
topics

285
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,040
so it could be about the post you're

286
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,399
waiting to be delivered

287
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,279
payments you're waiting to have

288
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:34,240
penalties tax penalties

289
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,120
it relies on emotions so subjects lines

290
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,680
are designed

291
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,360
to make you feel fearful or make you

292
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,519
feel this is very urgent i need to look

293
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,920
at this i need to deal with this now

294
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,000
and when a person has that kind of

295
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,079
feeling they might not necessarily

296
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,360
stop and think so it's playing to

297
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:51,199
emotions

298
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,279
or it could be cajoling you to do the

299
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,000
right thing click that link fix that

300
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,640
payment

301
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,000
you know we want to do whatever we want

302
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,240
to help you we want to

303
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,440
give your television streaming service

304
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,959
back just click that link

305
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,839
give us your credit card details your

306
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:09,359
date of birth your mother's maiden name

307
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:11,680
and a false sense of security so

308
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,279
end users including ourselves because we

309
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,519
are all end users

310
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,959
may sometimes believe that technology

311
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,120
such as our spam filters

312
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,959
will be able to block all malicious

313
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,640
emails therefore the emails we receive

314
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,880
are fine

315
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,279
there also could be an overconfidence in

316
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,920
one's abilities to spot scams

317
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:31,839
i have worked in cyber crime and cyber

318
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:33,680
security for a very long time and i

319
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,279
am still not over confident in my own

320
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,319
ability to spot scams

321
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:41,600
because scams are really really clever

322
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,320
so these three things can make scammy

323
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,040
emails

324
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,959
successful they are believable they play

325
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:50,399
to emotions and the false sense for

326
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,399
security that someone may have

327
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,160
and while we're talking about cybercrime

328
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:56,000
being successful

329
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,160
and playing to emotions let's have a

330
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,480
look at some examples that have happened

331
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:03,040
in the last few months

332
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,920
global distraction is covert 19 and

333
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,599
these are just

334
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,479
a very very very very infertile amount

335
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,680
of examples that i can show you from the

336
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,160
world

337
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,680
that have people have received these so

338
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,920
there's text messages

339
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,000
smishing you've received a message

340
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,079
regarding the covert 19 safety line

341
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,839
symptoms and when to get tested

342
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,560
there have been all sorts of variations

343
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,480
on this you have to visit this link

00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,160
so you visit the link and then that link

345
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,760
asks you for information this one in

346
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,719
particular wants your credit card

347
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,399
details

348
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,760
your name address and date of birth so

349
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,959
it's pretty easy what they want there

350
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,480
they want to steal your credit card

351
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,079
information

352
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,160
this one is an important message from

353
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,920
westpac apparently

354
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,760
if you go to that link they ask you to

355
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,880
log into your westpac account so

356
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,319
obviously you're not going to go into

357
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
your actual westpac account you're just

358
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:54,480
giving

359
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,160
the criminals your bank account details

360
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,240
this one is due to the coronavirus

361
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,399
pandemic worldwide netflix is giving

362
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,120
some free pass to their platform this is

363
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:02,800
awesome

364
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,839
click that link just put your netflix

365
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,199
details in and give it all to the

366
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:09,680
criminals so these are really

367
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,440
very believable you'd have to you know

368
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,719
think twice and go hang on is that

369
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:16,079
legitimate

370
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:19,440
they certainly play to emotion there

371
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:21,760
then we have scams here

372
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,800
update list of new cases around your

373
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,720
area

374
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,719
you were immediately advised to go

375
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,680
through these cases to avoid potential

376
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,959
hazards

377
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,719
now this one this type of

378
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:34,719
email has been seen many many times

379
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,399
different iterations but this one in

380
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,959
particular that i saw

381
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,880
actually downloaded melron to computer i

382
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,719
have seen others very very similar with

383
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,000
almost the same words that were phishing

384
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,160
sites so

385
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,720
criminals tend to use the same script

386
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:51,680
but change it up to how they want

387
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,959
and then we have a almost it's kind of

388
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,079
like a business email compromise it's a

389
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,959
payroll scam

390
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,719
where you know because of the covered 19

391
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:01,199
pandemic they want to change their bank

392
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,360
account to a bank closer to home

393
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,880
you know i need this information to

394
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,720
update my direct deposit

395
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,720
so they pretend to be an employee they

396
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,279
contact the hr department and get the

397
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,320
paid change to the bank account of their

398
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,959
choice

399
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,360
hr do that for them and then the

400
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,239
criminal pockets your wage instead of

401
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,079
you

402
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:24,959
and then of course we have this one

403
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,160
i'm reaching out to you as my only hope

404
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,359
this is kind of like

405
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,439
the so-called 4-1-9 scam in a way

406
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,440
but this is quite interesting i don't

407
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,399
know if one would really be fooled by

408
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,800
this if you knew what an

409
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:38,240
itunes gift card would give you because

410
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,199
they're saying they're stuck

411
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,959
in quarantine and they need something to

412
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,680
get their everyday essentials and

413
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,800
they want you to give them a 250 itunes

414
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:50,880
gift card

415
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,639
so this would only fool people that

416
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,399
didn't understand that itunes gift card

417
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,360
isn't going to pay your groceries

418
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,320
but still people would be fooled by this

419
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,760
criminals

420
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,000
are tweaking us they're con artists

421
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,839
they know what will scare us and they

422
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,680
will keep trying and they will throw out

423
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,680
lots and lots and lots of these messages

424
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,399
to lots and lots and lots of people

425
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,638
and some will stick so it's worth it to

426
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,639
them

427
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,959
and with more fishing adventures here we

428
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,399
have one that also includes a data

429
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:22,719
breach

430
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,639
news came out recently about something

431
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,040
that service new south wales had

432
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:28,720
suffered they had an incident that

433
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,480
started from a phishing scam

434
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,639
the phishing scam was discovered in

435
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,120
april this year and it targeted

436
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,160
their employees the phishing scam was

437
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,000
successful

438
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,160
and then they later discovered a data

439
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,040
breach in may 2020

440
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,319
so the phishing itself scamming

441
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,040
employees

442
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:50,639
led to exfiltration of data and they

443
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:53,279
discovered that around 186 000 customers

444
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,399
data was stolen which was close to four

445
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,560
million items

446
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,399
including photocopies of driver's

447
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,359
licenses car registration and birth

448
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,680
certificates

449
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,880
so that's a huge amount of information

450
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,120
that has stolen

451
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,720
and derived from a phishing scam

452
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,639
originally

453
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:11,040
remember though that anyone can become a

454
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,440
victim of cyber crime

455
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:14,880
there is no point in victim blaming

456
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,079
because the fault is with the criminals

457
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,759
the criminals that did this the

458
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:20,239
criminals that scammed these people the

459
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:22,720
criminals that stole this information

460
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,560
the fallout from scams such as phishing

461
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,560
can be huge

462
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,399
i really feel sorry for service new

463
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,518
south wales and the employees that

464
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,079
were scammed by this the fallout is so

465
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,000
huge

466
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,120
to the businesses to the employees scam

467
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,320
to customers

468
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,639
the potential for id theft this started

469
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,079
from

470
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:45,040
fishing fishing is not a small problem

471
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,040
it's a big problem

472
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,440
let's turn the page now and read the sad

473
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:52,560
sad story of the fake zoom

474
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:55,120
or film if you will

475
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,279
since the global pandemic people have

476
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,560
found themselves in lockdown situations

477
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,920
quarantine

478
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,399
not being able to actually go to their

479
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,839
physical workplaces or schools

480
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,160
or not being able to see their friends

481
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:08,000
and family this is where

482
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,319
applications such as zoom have gained

483
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,400
popularity

484
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:14,959
zoom has been used for online meetings

485
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,880
and seminars lectures schools

486
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,039
it allows for remote work and

487
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,120
collaboration with colleagues

488
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,559
it's used for exercise classes such as

489
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,319
yoga and gym

490
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,599
and also virtual socializing where

491
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,438
people get together

492
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,199
on zoom to drink their coffee and watch

493
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:31,679
each other on zoom drinking

494
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,600
coffee but criminals know this they're

495
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:35,760
very adept at reading situations

496
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,199
and they know that people are using zoom

497
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,320
and downloading zoom

498
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:43,440
so what they have done is create

499
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:47,360
faked zoom installers on websites

500
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:50,160
that spoof vendors or spoof zoom

501
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:52,159
these faked zoom executables actually do

502
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:54,000
download zoom and they do work just to

503
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,039
zoom is because it actually is zoom

504
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,400
software but it contains a few extras

505
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,919
that nobody at zoom

506
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,799
had ever thought it would the criminals

507
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,000
download with the zoom installer remote

508
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:08,000
access trojans

509
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,480
cryptominers to drain your cpu while

510
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:13,520
they gather the monero or the bitcoin

511
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,280
and malicious adware so that if you had

512
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:17,918
downloaded one of these faked

513
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,678
zoom installers you could get served up

514
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,000
a lot of ads that when you clicked into

515
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,520
them

516
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,280
actually downloaded more malicious

517
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:26,240
software

518
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,280
so criminals are adept at exploiting

519
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:29,280
situations

520
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:32,720
just as they are adept at exploiting

521
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,720
vulnerabilities on software

522
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:41,840
and from zoom we go to ransomware

523
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,559
in june 2020 a large australian beverage

524
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,120
company called

525
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,720
lyon suffered a huge ransomware incident

526
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,280
and the criminals also threatened to

527
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,120
post

528
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:53,200
stolen files online lion has been

529
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,639
issuing updates on their website which i

530
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,679
have put there if you want to read more

531
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:58,400
about it

532
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:58,880
but they took their systems offline to

533
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,480
stop

534
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,160
their networks becoming more exposed to

535
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,840
the malware and it took a long time for

536
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,039
them to get up to date with their

537
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,799
deliveries and

538
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,559
their suppliers and their consumers and

539
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,639
they had to install a lot of manual

540
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,480
tasks to take over from where automation

541
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,360
was so it caused a lot of disruption to

542
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,280
them

543
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,479
toll group was hit twice by ransomware

544
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,720
this year

545
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,880
once by male 2 ransomware in february

546
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,720
and nephilim in may

547
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,000
fischer and paikel were also hit by

548
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,720
nephilim this time in

549
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,760
around in may early june i've left the

550
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:33,120
links there if anyone wants to read more

551
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,280
ransomware is often spread by malicious

552
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:37,520
attachments or links in emails so

553
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,320
like a phishing email the emails trick

554
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,639
you into

555
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,559
downloading and installing the malware

556
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,880
that causes ransomware

557
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,520
it's also spread via drive by

558
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:51,039
downloading so a person visits a website

559
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:53,280
and the malware downloads if we

560
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,360
help raise awareness of this kind of

561
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:57,840
thing and what to do in case of an

562
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,879
incident of ransomware it helps

563
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,120
companies

564
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,320
either not get it in the first place or

565
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:05,199
if they do get it

566
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,200
know what to do

567
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:12,400
so what about a tech solution

568
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,840
i love technology i really love

569
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,640
technology when i was a child i used to

570
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,959
make robots out of cardboard boxes

571
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,000
but sadly there is no solely tech

572
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,600
solution to solving

573
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,520
cybercrime like we mentioned in the

574
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,439
earlier pages of our comic book

575
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,918
cybercrime is an umbrella term for many

576
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:30,559
many many different crime types that use

577
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:32,640
or go against technology there isn't one

578
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,000
type of tech solution that can support

579
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,919
this and there's also no

580
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,200
one type of human solution that can

581
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:40,400
support this

582
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:42,480
my opinion and my opinion only is that

583
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,840
we need a combined effort of both a

584
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,840
technical solution

585
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,559
and a human-centric solution to come

586
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,120
together in a

587
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,600
symbiotic relationship if you will to

588
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:56,399
help work against cybercrime

589
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,120
cybercrime evolves really really fast

590
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,720
and it can go

591
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,000
faster than technical security

592
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,880
mechanisms can be developed or

593
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,039
configured

594
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,960
remember cybercrime can be backed by a

595
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,559
huge criminal organization with lots and

596
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,360
lots and lots of money for research and

597
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,120
development

598
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,879
that all of us as the good guys just

599
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,639
don't have

600
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,559
whenever there is a crime targeting a

601
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,320
human there really needs to be human as

602
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:18,080
well as a technical solution because it

603
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,240
could be playing on psychology like we

604
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:22,399
looked at the phishing scams

605
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,600
no technical solution on its own can

606
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:26,640
protect us from all

607
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:28,719
cyber crime types now

608
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,880
also this is a very important thing

609
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,720
anyone can be a victim of cyber crime

610
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,440
nobody is immune it doesn't matter how

611
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,039
clever

612
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,880
you think you are or how long you've

613
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:39,760
worked in this space

614
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,840
anyone can be a victim of cyber crime

615
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:45,120
and of course we can't security patch a

616
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,439
human

617
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,360
that brings us to the very important

618
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:51,760
part of this comic

619
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,879
how can we all be cybercrime fighting

620
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,960
superheroes

621
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,080
and i'm talking about all users of

622
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,080
technology

623
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:59,520
doesn't matter what age they are doesn't

624
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,120
matter where they come from doesn't

625
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,039
matter what language they speak doesn't

626
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,760
matter what their education or interests

627
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,960
or work

628
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:10,320
are how can we all be cybercrime

629
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:10,320
fighting superheroes

630
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,840
with the cover 19 pandemic there's been

631
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:16,960
this phrase

632
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:20,158
herd immunity bandied around

633
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,159
herd immunity in a way is is something

634
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,720
that you could apply here

635
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:25,200
in that if everybody did their bit to

636
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,919
fight

637
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,880
cyber crime it would make our community

638
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:31,600
and our nation

639
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,600
a harder target for criminals so we

640
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,879
would kind of get cyber crime herd

641
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:37,199
immunity

642
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,799
but if everyone did their bit to fight

643
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,720
cybercrime if they

644
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:42,559
used technology and when they used it

645
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:44,640
they used it more safely

646
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,720
and they helped their friends and their

647
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:49,440
peers use it more safely

648
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,520
then everyone is doing their bit to make

649
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,720
our nation a harder target against

650
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,440
cybercrime

651
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:57,760
and because we're doing that we are now

652
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:00,960
cybercrime fighting superheroes

653
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,799
but really how do we do this

654
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,080
i have a little selection of characters

655
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:07,039
here

656
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:08,080
they are just a small cross section

657
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,080
trying to make a point

658
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:12,000
here where i have two little kids and a

659
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,520
ballet dancer and a hairdresser and an

660
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,200
elderly lady and

661
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,080
a schoolteacher who looks a bit smarmy

662
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:20,799
there but these characters

663
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,678
are trying to show you that none of

664
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,600
these people

665
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,880
look like they actually work in the

666
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,760
cyber industry

667
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,720
but all of these people can do something

668
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:37,840
to help fight

669
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:37,840
cyber crime

670
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,520
every little bit helps to fight cyber

671
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,840
crime

672
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:45,440
if everyone in the community who is an

673
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,959
end user and let's face it that's

674
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,559
basically all of us

675
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,520
unless we're hermits that have no

676
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:54,960
electricity and completely off the grid

677
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:57,840
if every one of us did something towards

678
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,559
fighting cybercrime it would make our

679
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,879
community

680
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:02,080
and our nation a harder target against

681
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:05,760
cybercrime

682
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:08,799
fighting cybercrime is not solely

683
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:10,240
the province of your i.t teams or of law

684
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,120
enforcement or your intelligence

685
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,039
communities

686
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,120
everyone that uses technology has a

687
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:18,799
responsibility to do something

688
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,719
to make the cybers safer

689
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,799
so in this instance we have our teacher

690
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,960
here he teaches primary school

691
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,799
and he provides age-appropriate

692
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,080
information to his class about being

693
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,400
safer online

694
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,399
so he's helping to introduce the culture

695
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,640
to his children that it's normal

696
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:37,279
everyday things that you do something to

697
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,320
be safer online so his school children

698
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,440
can be safer online we have a

699
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,279
hairdresser here

700
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,400
who can make sure that his the software

701
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:48,960
he uses is in his salon is patched

702
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:52,000
it's a small thing but it's something

703
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:56,159
towards making his hairdressing sell on

704
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:58,799
and other people safer from cybercrime

705
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:00,640
this elderly lady didn't have the

706
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,559
internet in her day

707
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,240
but she makes sure that her

708
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,480
grandchildren understand the need for

709
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:09,200
strong passwords

710
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:11,279
we have a ballet dancer here who her

711
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,679
choreographer was nearly scammed nearly

712
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:16,480
paid an invoice that that was fake

713
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:18,320
so she made sure that the choreographer

714
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:20,320
knew how to report this scam

715
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,039
and she warned her friends about it so

716
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,439
she's doing her bit to fight cybercrime

717
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:26,400
making her little community safer from

718
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,320
cybercrime

719
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:31,279
making her little community a harder

720
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:34,158
target for cybercrime to be successful

721
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:35,520
we have our little children here so this

722
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,440
little youngster is saying that if

723
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,720
something or someone online makes me

724
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,200
uncomfortable i tell a trusted adult

725
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,799
and then we have a little boy with a dog

726
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,279
who's a cybercrime fighting

727
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:48,960
superhero because he helps his friends

728
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,679
to be careful about who they talk to

729
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,279
online

730
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,960
and he makes sure they know that not

731
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:56,559
everyone on online is

732
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:58,400
who they say they are so of all these

733
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,720
things there's only one here that is a

734
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,840
technical solution is the hairdresser

735
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:05,520
who has his software patched but even to

736
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,600
know to patch his software

737
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,799
is an awareness thing so he's aware that

738
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,639
he has to do it

739
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,480
so see all these people they're cyber

740
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,400
crime fighters all of them

741
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,400
they are hardening their community

742
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,760
against cyber crime they're all doing

743
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:22,799
their bit

744
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:26,158
to support a safer online community

745
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:29,840
so where do from here in australia

746
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:32,320
we have places we can report cyber crime

747

anyone can read and that blog has

775
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:37,039
a lot of useful information the e-safety

776
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,799
commissioner

777

age-appropriate information about

782
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,640
staying safer online to

783
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:52,399
small school groups and

784
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,320
of course scamwatch has information

785
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:56,399
about scams

786
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:59,200
everyone can be a cybercrime fighting

787
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:02,158
hero and champion against cybercrime

788
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,320
to harden our communities and our nation

789
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,240
as a target against cybercrime we all

790
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,399
need to work together

791
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:12,080
working together makes us strong

792
00:28:09,399 --> 00:28:13,760
cybercrime-fighting superheroes but to

793
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,000
work together we actually have to have

794
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:18,320
information and keep ourselves aware

795
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,200
and it's not just the duty of our i.t

796
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,240
teams

797
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,840
or the acsc or ozer or the e-safety

798
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,559
commissioner or the police to keep us

799
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,799
informed

800
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:28,720
we have to keep ourselves informed if

801
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:31,360
we're using this technology then we need

802
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,760
to understand what we're using

803
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,360
if there is cybercrime around we need to

804
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:37,520
understand that it exists

805
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,279
and that it isn't a mysterious hoodie

806
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,399
wearing hacker rubbing his hands

807
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,159
together in glee

808
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,158
that there are criminal organizations

809
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,840
that are doing this we need to have an

810
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:47,279
understanding so we know who we are

811
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,840
fighting

812
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:53,840
we can be heroes we can all be

813
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:56,320
cybercrime-fighting superheroes

814
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,320
we need to ensure that any information

815
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,158
we have about scams if we are allowed to

816
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,840
share it that we do

817
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,919
we need to ensure that our children or

818
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,959
the children that we mentor or the

819
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,399
children that we teach understand a

820
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:11,200
safer way to use

821
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,000
the online community we need to ensure

822
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:14,640
that we report

823
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,320
things appropriately and if we are

824
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,600
allowed to share intelligence that we

825
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,480
share that intelligence with the right

826
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:23,840
people so something can be done about it

827
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:27,200
we need all of you to be superheroes

828
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:31,439
cyber crime fighting superheroes we can

829
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:33,600
all be heroes just to sum up this little

830
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:37,200
comic book here

831
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,320
cybercrime is big business cybercrime is

832
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,159
an umbrella term

833
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,840
there's all different types of things

834
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:44,720
under that umbrella term

835
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,199
that's why there can not be one type of

836
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,640
technical solution for this

837
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,399
lots of different types of people are

838
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:54,480
involved in cyber crime

839
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:56,479
from huge big criminal organizations to

840
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,559
your opportunists

841
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,799
we have to stop thinking that there is a

842
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,320
hacker in a hoodie doing this stuff

843
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,679
if we don't understand what cybercrime

844
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,918
actually is how can we protect ourselves

845
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,919
cybercrime is another crime type in fact

846
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:11,760
many different crime types

847
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,279
there is no solely tech or solely

848
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,960
human-based solution

849
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,320
technology and humans need to work

850
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,760
together

851
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,439
not like terminator because they weren't

852
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,480
working together there but

853
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:25,039
technology used appropriately and

854
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,480
humans made aware and humans knowing how

855
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,600
to use the technology

856
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,559
to help work on the solution all

857
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,840
and users including us because we we our

858
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:36,639
end users as well

859
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:40,158
need to use cyberspace safely we need to

860
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,399
use it with safety and security in mind

861
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,080
every user of technology regardless of

862
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,559
their age education

863
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,320
skills or jobs can be cybercrime

864
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:50,960
fighting superheroes

865
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,760
we all need to stay informed we all need

866
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,760
to stay safe

867
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:59,200
i want to thank all of you that actually

868
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,320
tuned into the session and those that

869
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,320
actually made it to the end

870
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,678
i know as i said at the start there will

871
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,600
be people saying i know all this

872
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:09,760
information it's nothing new

873
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,199
but again i pose the question to you if

874
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:14,640
it is nothing new

875
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:17,919
why is cybercrime still a problem

876
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,519
it is within all of us regardless of

877
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,000
backgrounds or

878
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,919
interests or anything to become cyber

879
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,080
crime fighting superheroes

880
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,120
and if some people know more about

881
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,439
cybercrime or

882
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:31,518
more about technology than others then i

883
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,760
think it's our responsibility our duty

884
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:35,360
to help people understand cyber crime

885
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,320
and help them understand how to be more

886
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,000
secure

887
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:42,158
regardless of where we're working it is

888
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,399
important it's an imperative that we all

889
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,440
take the responsibility as end users

890
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:49,039
to make the cyberspace safer for

891
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,480
everyone

892
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:53,600
i also want to thank the austin

893
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,200
conference organizers and austin itself

894
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,320
because this is an amazing

895
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,440
innovative conference during the global

896
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,918
pandemic things

897
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,320
can get quite depressing the fact that

898
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:06,640
ozer continued and made a conference is

899
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:11,519
amazing so thanks everyone

900
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:11,519
cybercrime fighters assemble

901
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,559
oh there we go my camera just went off

902
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,879
again how wonderful

903
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,879
um if anybody has any questions feel

904
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,240
free to throw them in the q a

905
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,320
um otherwise we have a

906
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,840
what's that about a seven minute break

907
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,840
until the next session starts here

908
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:34,559
how do you convince your parents to

909
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,080
change their passwords well

910
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:39,840
i here i have no idea um my parents have

911
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,879
never used computers because they're so

912
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:43,760
old

913
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:45,200
but i would say they need to change

914
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:48,879
their passwords because

915
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:50,480
if a criminal got their information then

916
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:52,000
they would lose things so i don't know

917
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,559
what your parents use or how old they

918
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,320
are but

919
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,600
maybe share with them information such

920
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,399
as criminals stealing bank account

921
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:59,360
details

922
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,760
and getting into emails and things and

923
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,639
yes

924
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,559
um what i would like to do gary is

925
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,960
actually have my actual slides like the

926
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,799
ones that the pdf version which was the

927
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,000
real slide deck and it has my full

928
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,918
narration on there

929
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,240
and i'm very happy for anyone to have

930
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:14,240
that

931
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,880
and thanks sashi

932
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,840
and thanks paul that's very sweet of you

933
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:32,320
i'll try and drop the full version in

934
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:32,320
the chat in a little bit

935
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,600
so mandy how do you convince people it

936
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,080
won't happen to me

937
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,760
which is a fun retort that almost

938
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,879
everybody in every walk of life seems to

939
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,039
come back with and

940
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,159
actually understand that it's actually

941
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:48,320
for everybody

942
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,919
oh yeah well i'm always saying that

943
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,399
anyone can become a victim of cyber

944
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,480
crime

945
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:54,479
and i have spoken before at conferences

946
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,159
about how i nearly became a victim of

947
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:58,399
cyber crime it was when i was still with

948
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:02,000
my old agency valdemar when i worked um

949
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:03,678
acic and i was working from the jcsc

950
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,360
i had three computers out one i was

951
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:06,159
doing forensics on one was my work one

952
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,560
one

953
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,000
was a personal one and my father kept

954
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:11,520
ringing me from the

955
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,960
residential care facility he's at

956
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,480
because he was waiting for some post

957
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,839
from veterans affair in england that was

958
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,079
going to come to me

959
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:20,078
so i had things from all sides i was a

960
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:21,200
remote manager so my teams were actually

961
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,760
calling me

962
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:24,799
um it was when my boss had actually gone

963
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:26,720
on leave so

964
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,399
with my boss as well as myself as well

965
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,560
as managing my team

966
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:33,199
there was things coming me always and i

967
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:35,679
got an email to my personal email saying

968
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:37,918
your post has been delayed please click

969
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,879
here to verify your details

970
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:41,520
and i re i nearly did it because i was

971
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,440
just so

972
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,040
overall with work and my dad kept

973
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,560
nagging me about his parcel from

974
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,399
veterans affairs in england

975
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:50,560
but i nearly did it and then i went hang

976
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,078
on it's coming from dhl

977
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,839
it wouldn't be from dhl if it was from

978
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:56,079
england and that's what stopped me

979
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:58,078
so i nearly fell victim to cybercrime

980
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,760
anyone can fall victim to cybercrime it

981
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:01,599
doesn't matter how much you know

982
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:17,839
or how much you actually work in the

983
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:17,839
industry anyone can fall victim

984
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:23,200
sorry i was on mute uh on my actual mic

985
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,800
so i was saying uh that's

986
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,240
that's what uh i was hoping to hear

987
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,160
because even in this industry

988
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,439
everybody can suffer even if even if

989
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,839
they're a security expert they can be

990
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:32,960
caught

991
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:36,000
it's something that a lot of people

992
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,000
don't like to talk about

993
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,200
john said his parents use their

994
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:43,598
passwords and he's in his 60s

995
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,759
i'm not in my 60s but my parents much

996
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:48,640
much much much older or they had me

997
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:49,520
migrated to england to australia from

998
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,560
england

999
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:54,079
so um yeah my my mum

1000
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,839
actually may have used a computer

1001
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,599
because she worked with bletchley for a

1002
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:59,520
while during world war ii

1003
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:02,079
but certainly what kinds of computers we

1004
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:02,079
get now

1005
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:06,720
oh the response candles itt if i get

1006
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:09,680
fished is not my fault

1007
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,839
um everybody's responsibility is cyber

1008
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,560
security as per

1009
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:16,640
my we're doing something

1010
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,680
about their own security and their cyber

1011
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,240
crime

1012
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,799
what anyone fault that you've fished

1013
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,879
because

1014
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:24,560
it's not it's implanted but it is

1015
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,800
everyone's responsibility

1016
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,160
and i won't recommend any because i have

1017
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,240
worked in the government for many years

1018
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,040
as velgama knows and we don't recommend

1019
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,439
things

1020
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:34,800
because it may fire on us so even now i

1021
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,520
