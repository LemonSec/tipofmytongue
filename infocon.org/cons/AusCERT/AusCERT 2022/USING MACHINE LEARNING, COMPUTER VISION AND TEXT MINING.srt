nature of what i'm talking about and

37
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,159
we're talking about the trafficking of

38
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,320
ancestral remains around the world that

39
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,000

my first time with this conference

i hope that what i will speak about can

60
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,959
stand as an interesting and important

61
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,160
example of how experts in cyber security

62
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,959
ethical ai and social media research

63
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,879
can name must

64
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,200
work together to continue to tackle the

65
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,599
flourishing of illicit markets across

66
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,120
platforms

67
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,360
so a quick note to begin with um

68
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,200
may i ask you could take any photographs

69
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,680
that you like here but can i ask you

70
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,879
kindly to

71
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,599
not post any photographs onto your own

72
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:52,959
accounts

73
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,280
you know as i watch the traffickers i

74
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,800
know that many of them are watching me

75
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,959
as well

76
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,800
and also i want to know to all in

77
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,519
attendance that there are three

78
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,720
fortunately

79
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,519
not gory and not too graphic examples of

80
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,800
human remains

81
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,599
as

82
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,400
trafficked items in sales posts that i

83
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,800
included for illustrative purposes here

84
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,319
so i want to give you a fair warning of

85
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,360
that

86
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,720
i'm sorry i'm right before lunch but

87
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,239
now i've

88
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,640
let you know so i want to carry on

89
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,958
okay

90
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,680
i always like to begin with a case study

91
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,440
to set the stage

92
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,680
to demonstrate clearly that human

93
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,319
remains trafficking remains a real and

94
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,120
arguably growing problem today on and

95
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,879
offline

96
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,360
so here we have a case that received

97
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,319
considerable media coverage in 2019

98
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,799
a man in egypt was apprehended

99
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,879
after a shipment was seized at cairo

100
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,319
airport

101
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,840
bound for belgium

102
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,400
the fragments of mummy had left were one

103
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,400
of several possible shipments

104
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
allegedly ordered by a buyer found on

105
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,159
facebook

106
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,120
fortunately this was stopped in time by

107
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,680
security authorities at cairo airport

108
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,000
but i can tell you that mummy remains

109
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,879
our real quote-unquote prestige items in

110
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,279
these trafficking communities

111
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,720
regardless of whether they have been

112
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,320
circulating between collections for

113
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,358
decades

114
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,919
or were more recently exported

115
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,479
thus i want to stress

116
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,400
cases like this are just the tip of the

117
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,280
iceberg but extreme examples always make

118
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,400
the news

119
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,639
there is much more under the scenes if

120
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,960
you will

121
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:38,800
so

122
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,160
at the start

123
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,520
you might be asking yourself this

124
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,240
question that's correct yeah

125
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,000
why should the living care who buys the

126
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,440
dead

127
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,320
to me

128
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,320
it always comes down to the fact that

129
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,800
the dead can't speak for themselves

130
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,120
and the private commercial market today

131
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,400
on and offline

132
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,720
continues a long tradition of

133
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,240
commodification or fetishes

134
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,039
fetishization

135
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:04,160
of

136
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,240
individuals ancestral remains

137
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,479
from around the world usually global

138
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,960
south to global north a practice that's

139
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,840
been occurring from colonial times

140
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,919
and has exploded today

141
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:16,800
so

142
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,120
we as forensic anthropologists

143
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,080
archaeologists criminologists and cyber

144
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,440
crime researchers

145
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,919
civilian and law enforcement alike

146
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,840
can and must help

147
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,479
the reasons given at left are to me a

148
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,880
few of the many that would justify why

149
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,800
we do the work we do

150
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,840
and

151
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,000
it might not surprise you the rise of

152
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,320
e-commerce and social media

153
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,639
has allowed a quirky hobby

154
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,720
to explode and proliferate

155
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,720
an issue known about as far back as

156
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,520
early ebay the days of the height of

157
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,759
ebay's market in the early 2000s

158
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:54,880
if anything

159
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,639
the problem of selling on provenian's

160
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,720
dead has gotten worse

161
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,440
even as it slowly gets more attention

162
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,440
there are many gray areas and there is

163
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,360
much left to find and know

164
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,280
okay

165
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,319
so

166
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:11,919
i i trust that i don't need to tell

167
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,160
anyone in this room that the internet is

168
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,759
a vast ecosystem

169
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,520
constantly fluctuating as laws and

170
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,080
policy changes and with many unexplored

171
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,199
corners

172
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,039
not just on the dark web but the deep

173
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,520
and surface web too

174
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,400
hence

175
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,440
what my colleagues and i frequently say

176
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,520
yes uh why my colleagues and i

177
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,080
frequently say that illicit trafficking

178
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,880
is often hiding in plain sight

179
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,440
thus to chart uncharted spaces where a

180
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,600
variety of crimes flourish detect

181
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,400
partnerships and combine skill sets

182
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,319
if our end goal is preventing cyber

183
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,319
crime and separating illicit from

184
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,120
illicit commerce in general

185
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,039
where trafficking is concerned

186
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,120
the goal is to create better and more

187
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,520
enforceable data-driven policy

188
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,560
and guiding material for law enforcement

189
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,479
so we can improve the extent to which we

190
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,599
can encounter and expose it ethically

191
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,360
until such time as the platforms

192
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,520
themselves are legally required to

193
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,159
really act

194
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:15,520
so

195
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,880
to this end

196
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,039
i want to circle back a bit to situate

197
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,039
maya and colleagues work that aims to

198
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,360
understand today's human remains trade

199
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,840
using digital humanities tools within

200
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,919
its larger context

201
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:28,800
so

202
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,639
together with my carlton university

203
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,039
colleague professor strong graham

204
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,120
we have led the bone trade project since

205
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,199
2018

206
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,000
and we are also two of seven co-founders

207
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,800
of the alliance to counter crime online

208
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,879
so this ngo was founded in 2018 also and

209
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,120
we are dedicated to researching a wide

210
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,440
variety of categories of trafficking to

211
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,919
understand similarities and differences

212
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,319
between how platforms are used to move

213
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,520
for example

214
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,360
drugs wildlife antiquities human remains

215
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,720
living humans

216
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,560
animal cruelty videos

217
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,879
spread drug cartel messaging the list

218
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,440
goes on and on

219
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,680
really part of this work has been

220
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,840
creating infographics like the one i

221
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,120
have here

222
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,080
fact sheets briefing reports and policy

223
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,720
documents to help legislators in various

224
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,599
governments quickly grasp the issues

225
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,160
here how illicit goods are fenced on

226
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,240
many e-commerce platforms

227
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,000
but as you all would understand of

228
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,240
course the devil is in the details when

229
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:36,080
it comes to the cyber side of all this

230
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,479
so

231
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,159
what does the current landscape of human

232
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,240
remains trafficking online look like

233
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,720
the short answer is it's complicated

234
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,880
the long answer can be seen here to some

235
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,000
extent

236
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,560
mind you this data from a 2020 paper

237
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,760
concerns only public instagram profiles

238
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,399
personal and business pages

239
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,240
it is itself an update of our initial

240
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,880
efforts to scrape public instagram pages

241
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,760
using several key hashtags such as

242
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,760
human skull for sale

243
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,480
while total prices increase year by year

244
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,880
note that these are underestimates given

245
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,279
we found more relevant public accounts

246
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,000
with fewer unique public posts than

247
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,760
stated prices publicly and openly

248
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,760
so we know that this is a cross-platform

249
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,640
issue

250
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,800
the key point here is that the

251
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,720
algorithms behind them actively

252
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,440
influence how and which pages

253
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,839
researchers buyers or onlookers

254
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,760
encounter whether on purpose or

255
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,399
accidentally

256
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,279
okay so

257
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,360
before i go further

258
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,519
a note about where we stand on user

259
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,839
privacy and the ethics of scraping the

260
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,480
public internet and taking a macro level

261
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,240
big data approach

262
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,760
which is the way we've performed this

263
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,000
work so far

264
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,040
so like the agents and their dog targets

265
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,959
in the cartoon it writes which i always

266
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,560
have found funny

267
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,839
we are concerned with providing

268
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,880
contextual intel to law enforcement when

269
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,760
asked

270
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,760
and assessing the large scale patterns

271
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,800
inherent

272
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,880
in the image text and metadata we

273
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,920
collect

274
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,440
separating the signal from the noise

275
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
well in the paper i mentioned in the

276
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,440
slide we provide a much more detailed

277
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,839
discussion of how we frame our ethical

278
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:25,440
responsibilities

279
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,760
but the key point here is that we now

280
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,399
restrict what we publish or share

281
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,200
within any publications uh even as

282
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,079
supplementary material because we guard

283
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,480
against the realization that

284
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,040
full de-anonymization is not really

285
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,120
possible and we've come to learn that

286
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,279
and now we act on that knowledge

287
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,800
so

288
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,200
we securely store

289
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,200
most of what we scrape and then you can

290
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,440
analyze just those aspects of the data

291
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,839
that interest you

292
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,160
okay

293
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,720
at this point in my talk you might be

294
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,320
asking yourself

295
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,240
why is controlling the proliferation of

296
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,160
this and many other forms of trafficking

297
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,560
online so difficult

298
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,040
again this is complicated and certainly

299
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,880
frustrating to civilians and law

300
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,399
enforcement alike

301
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,800
but hinges on the fact that most global

302
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,040
platforms are us-based

303
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,440
taking advantage of specific laws

304
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,680
and sometimes complacent media for

305
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,560
example the still from a tick-tock video

306
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,399
of a particular individual that formed

307
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,640
the catalyst for a separate study this

308
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,079
year that i discussed later

309
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,640
as important the private commercial

310
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,880
collection of of especially skeletal

311
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,000
material

312
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,240
sits within gaps in current commonwealth

313
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,560
laws of many countries it's not really

314
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,079
people and not really property

315
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,760
dealers accurately exploit these

316
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,920
loopholes knowing that enforcement is

317
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,320
rare and law enforcement often only

318
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,240
interested in big money antiquities

319
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,600
busts

320
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,240
this is changing in part due to our and

321
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,120
the alliance's work it's a slowly but

322
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,200
surely kind of process

323
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,120
very slowly but we're working on it

324
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,480
so

325
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,560
in addition to the legal issues

326
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,160
let's circle back to the fact that the

327
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,399
same algorithms that we all know can

328
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,120
monitor record and act on our browsing

329
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,839
history for whatever purpose

330
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,440
can also be readily tricked by those

331
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,480
determined to commit illicit commerce

332
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,560
the sales advert left from etsy is a

333
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,000
good example

334
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,320
essie publicly claimed to ban the human

335
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,440
remains trade in 2012 before ebay

336
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,519
followed suit in 2016

337
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,480
however

338
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,959
we see here someone advertising a ring

339
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,480
by indicating human remains are

340
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,600
available just saying to dm

341
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,800
little risk for possibly greater reward

342
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,920
i thus note what are to me two key cyber

343
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,160
security implications of this

344
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,839
quote unquote bans

345
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,399
mean nothing without ip blocking

346
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,240
and the ease with which proliferation of

347
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,240
traffic goods occurs

348
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,240
also carries personal cyber security

349
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,480
risks for those who accidentally find

350
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,399
shocking content

351
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,160
so how do we do how do we better

352
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,200
understand what's happening

353
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,040
okay

354
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,560
in the remainder of my talk i will

355
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,959
discuss the how of three of the

356
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,279
approaches our work is taking to date

357
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,680
in terms of image and text analysis to

358
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,920
view the online trade at scale

359
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,760
and give a few summary examples of what

360
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,320
we have done so far

361
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,680
firstly

362
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,519
this slide is provided just to make sure

363
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,120
we are on the same page regarding the

364
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,000
definition of key terms or at least how

365
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,160
i define them as

366
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,720
an itinerary digital humanities scholar

367
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,160
i come from it maybe from a different

368
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,959
perspective than you but i wanted to

369
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,720
show you how i think of it if i'm

370
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,959
incorrect i apologize but this is how

371
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,720
we've approached it

372
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,160
so we have here a rough and ready

373
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,000
schematic of how a convolutional neural

374
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,959
network

375
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,360
attempts to classify an unknown image

376
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,440
into a category of known images via

377
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,600
sampling convolutions

378
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,079
for our purposes the last and second

379
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,920
last layers are key

380
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,399
the fact that 37 of the output of the

381
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,120
last layer calls the cat shaped image a

382
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,440
dog is just a bit of a joke to

383
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,760
illustrate that it's not perfect yet

384
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,000
but we are trying to push boundaries

385
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,480
so illicit trafficking research using

386
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,639
machine learning is still a very new

387
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,199
frontier

388
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:30,800
okay

389
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,320
so

390
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,160
the following three slides present a bit

391
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,839
of a summary of three of the techniques

392
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,160
and software scraping packages we have

393
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,680
used today

394
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,120
i present this information with the

395
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,680
caveat that as we all know appy's

396
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,760
algorithms and internal machinations can

397
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,160
change rapidly especially when research

398
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,560
shines light on online crime

399
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,279
so consider it as food for thought

400
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,279
more details on the steps between these

401
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,760
general steps will be forthcoming in the

402
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,440
appendices of a book that professor

403
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,680
graham and i currently have on a review

404
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,760
about the bone trade

405
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,079
so on this first slide we describe how

406
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:08,959
to obtain hashtag metadata from public

407
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,959
instagram using instagram cli in python

408
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,320
authored by suwash jawali of mit

409
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,800
the important points to note are one of

410
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,639
course if you want to do this use a sock

411
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,560
puppet account only

412
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,079
in your code

413
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,079
keep changing where it asks for tag of

414
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,079
interest to whichever hashtag you want

415
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,680
to scrape

416
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,240
keep the number in your code after this

417
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,839
underscore many

418
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,720
low maybe 10 or so and leave gaps

419
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,279
between incidents of scraping to avoid

420
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,959
account blocking

421
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,480
and where your code asks safety advice

422
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,040
a false after the equal sign excludes

423
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,480
images and media like video and a true

424
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,800
will include it

425
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,120
and the username and password requested

426
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,279
by the code are those of your purpose

427
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,839
made account and running your code will

428
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,560
give you an alert from instagram labeled

429
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,399
as a new login attempt from chrome

430
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,360
mobile on google pixel 2.

431
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,519
that's just how it recognizes the use of

432
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,639
this

433
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,120
everything saves is a json file that can

434
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,399
be converted to csv and tabulated in

435
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:19,040
excel for further analysis and storing

436
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,759
of what you want to store

437
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,839
okay

438
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,680
in the scraping task above

439
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,240
one creates an environment called scrape

440
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,000
open your terminal or command prompt in

441
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,839
the folder you were working on the one

442
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,160
that contains your tag scrape dot pi

443
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,199
program

444
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,560
though we won't be using that program

445
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,160
this time and activate your environment

446
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,839
as you may obviously know jupiter

447
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,360
notebooks can be used with numerous

448
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,639
languages but here we stick with python

449
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,240
install your packages with it from

450
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,000
within your jupyter notebook for ease of

451
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,199
access

452
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,399
instagram cli gets us our metadata

453
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,000
while gensim

454
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
allows text analysis and pi lda vis will

455
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,240
allow visualization of the results for

456
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,119
better interpretation as above

457
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,799
change the hashtag whichever one you

458
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,679
want to explore and set this underscore

459
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,880
many to a low number set hashtag

460
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,400
underscore type equal to recent

461
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,760
using gensim pre-pre-processing

462
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,919
of your text corpus will remove

463
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,520
prepositions such as then and and of

464
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,400
and then we've taken two directions

465
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,799
word vector modeling envisions words as

466
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,039
a text in a text corpus

467
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,679
as occupying a two-dimensional space

468
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,760
where words used more frequently

469
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,840
together in source text are closer

470
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,880
together

471
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
we've used word to vec

472
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,960
to create models using the text

473
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,120
pre-processed in jensen

474
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,559
and we've found

475
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,360
that use of the continuous bag of words

476
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,919
feature is the best approach

477
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,520
it'll give you similarity measures

478
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,919
between zero and one will define each

479
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,280
pair of words

480
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,000
and jen sims word analogies option

481
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,400
allows further exploration

482
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,200
topic modeling of word corpus data uses

483
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,440
corpora also in gensim

484
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,080
again with the bag of words option

485
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,000
you set the number of topics that you

486
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,120
want to guess the corpora contains

487
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,720
and then use pi ldaviz to visualize how

488
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,000
word usage sorts between the topics

489
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,280
okay

490
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,600
and then finally i'll talk a bit about

491
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,760
what we've done with pix plot

492
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:30,720
so

493
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,120
the yale digital humanities lab has

494
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,360
written and bundled together the code

495
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,679
necessary to run thousands of images

496
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,440
through a neural network trained for

497
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,000
image recognition using google inception

498
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,600
version 3.

499
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,840
but instead of labeling each image the

500
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,679
code looks at how each image causes the

501
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,280
neural network to light up in different

502
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,400
ways as a list of numbers or scores

503
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,160
along each dimension that the neural

504
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,640
network looks at

505
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,400
the mathematical distance between each

506
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,480
list can be measured and the result can

507
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,400
be visualized using various clustering

508
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,240
algorithms here we have used python 3.7

509
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,600
and pixplot

510
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,400
installed via pip install

511
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,559
after creating a path to the folders of

512
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,880
jpeg images on your computer

513
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,280
pixplot will create subfolders and a

514
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,280
website within that location folder to

515
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,440
display one's results

516
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,600
pixplot allows you to also attach

517
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,480
metadata

518
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,880
to each image after clustering

519
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,120
which the pixplot repository can explain

520
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,640
further

521
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,720
once everything is sorted into clusters

522
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,960
you can then examine each hotspot at the

523
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,120
center of each cluster of images

524
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,760
and move between them to explore how and

525
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,360
why your corpus has been sorted thusly

526
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,919
then the human mediated interpretation

527
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,880
of the output is where insight into

528
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,640
image composition and trafficking

529
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,120
patterns can come from

530
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,000
okay so

531
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,200
the first example of our various uses of

532
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,440
these techniques to date comes from our

533
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,039
initial publication

534
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,440
of 2 7 2017.

535
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,840
our first look at networks and community

536
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,640
structure between bone trading accounts

537
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,640
on public instagram

538
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,679
here we use scrape instagram followers

539
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,280
from web robots

540
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,840
to then explore the network between the

541
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,000
22 accounts that we found

542
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,240
then named a price

543
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,679
on their

544
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,320
sales advertisements and obtained a list

545
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,320
of followers in common

546
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,679
circa late 2016 between those accounts

547
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,799
this resulted in approximately 138 000

548
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,000
users

549
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,760
with 172 000 shared links that connected

550
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,320
these 22 high profile individuals

551
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,600
so

552
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,679
using a multi-modal transformation

553
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,840
plug-in gel gephy

554
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,240
we ordered the accounts by page rank

555
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,640
or in other words how likely a random

556
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,039
user was to encounter them when just

557
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,640
beginning to search for human remains

558
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,400
related hashtags like

559
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,000
hashtag human skull for sale for example

560
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,799
we used arc diagram in r

561
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,559
to visualize this

562
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,880
and from this three sub communities

563
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,080
emerged

564
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,480
revealing a relatively strict hierarchy

565
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,480
between specialists

566
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,240
high money high profile people

567
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:23,200
collecting very certain types of remains

568
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,679
generalists you just want to get ahead

569
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,159
at all costs part of the pun

570
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,120
uh and the enthusiasts who

571
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,960
are new to the trade and through their

572
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,440
following connection to the high-profile

573
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,760
people get encouraged to

574
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,240
collect more buy more and

575
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,720
overlook legal moral and ethical issues

576
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,880
inherent in the practice

577
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,679
so this was also before the online

578
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,840
community had any real awareness that

579
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,039
exposure

580
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,240
was coming

581
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,320
also so these networks have certainly

582
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,120
changed by now

583
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,200
okay

584
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,960
in that same paper

585
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,640
we also explored how the bone drake

586
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,880
community uses what we call hashtag

587
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,159
stuffing

588
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,640
or distinct patterns of hashtag and word

589
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,919
reuse across posts and perhaps across

590
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,919
platforms

591
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,640
we asked might this be a way to identify

592
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,679
individual users digital fingerprints

593
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,919
within these spaces without needing to

594
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:25,919
identify the person's name or handle

595
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,400
here in this first attempt to do this we

596
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,520
use the text reuse package in r

597
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,640
and that generates engrams of five word

598
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,520
sets

599
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,480
and then assesses exact match similarity

600
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,799
using jaccard coefficients that's

601
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,799
in the order and the spelling and where

602
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,799
the hashtag is

603
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:48,880
how close is the exact match of the set

604
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,559
as the example shows

605
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,080
uh

606
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,400
there's promise here

607
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,760
and you can see how

608
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,760
between the first two examples it's

609
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,159
almost a perfect match of one because it

610
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,799
just has the addition of hashtag dead at

611
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,200
the end and the next two examples it's a

612
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,919
0.5 because the text of the

613
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,000
advertisement is very different then you

614
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,240
can see the reuse of some of those words

615
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,240
later on

616
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,039
right

617
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,480
where the use of such techniques

618
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,960
currently stands in cyber crime research

619
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,720
i am not fully sure

620
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,320
i'd be happy to talk about these things

621
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,559
with any of you further

622
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,679
of course

623
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,120
that's partly why i'm here i want to

624
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,320
pick your brains as well

625
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,919
okay

626
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:32,880
so

627
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,320
in this slide

628
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,919
i wanted to share some information from

629
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:37,600
a 2018 paper

630
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,440
our first to attempt to use machine

631
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,200
learning and convolutional neural

632
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,760
networks to examine patterns within the

633
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,640
big data sets of the images themselves

634
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,120
from sales posts as obtained in that

635
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,240
same 2017 era scrapes

636
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,799
of public instagram using in this case

637
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:55,919
again

638
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:00,080
human skull for sale as one instance

639
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,720
we ran an experiment using tensorflow

640
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,039
version two and again google inception

641
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:06,720
version three

642
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,559
reducing the multi-dimensional vector

643
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,279
space using t-sne and affinity

644
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,360
propagation

645
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,720
so doing so

646
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,720
sorted the image corpus of hundreds of

647
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,960
thousands of images into the clusters

648
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,679
seen in the figure it left

649
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,640
most clusters once checked manually for

650
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,440
commonalities contain noise

651
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,720
for example

652
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,600
drawings of skulls skulls on t-shirts

653
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,159
resin replicas and the like

654
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,760
sorry

655
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,360
the three clusters highlighted with

656
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,360
colored shapes however

657
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,440
all contain posts of human remains for

658
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,320
sale

659
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:44,880
positioned differently in the photograph

660
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,400
in one case all with stated price tags

661
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,480
written on the photos themselves using

662
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:54,000
adobe ms paint or in emojis tricks they

663
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,000
use to get around algorithmic detection

664
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,039
so this experiment led to more recent

665
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,200
work further probing how image

666
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,320
composition and aesthetics has come

667
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,159
become a means for dealers and

668
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,400
collectors to signal

669
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,440
group belonging and importantly to say

670
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,440
something is for sale without having to

671
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,320
say it's for sale

672
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,360
so how readily such a method can apply

673
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,440
to other areas of illicit trafficking or

674
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,919
cyber crime research remains to be seen

675
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,200
but

676
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,520
myself and professor graham have done

677
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,679
taking this approach on the human

678
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,080
remains trade and my colleagues in the

679
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,159
alliance to counter crime online who

680
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,240
study other areas of trafficking

681
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,840
wildlife to drugs

682
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,159
etc are also trying to move more into

683
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,679
the machine learning

684
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:44,640
space

685
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,000
to combine our efforts and to see where

686
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,600
the patterns

687
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,360
and the similarities lie between

688
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,679
categories of trafficking and what works

689
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,000
for me might not work for them and why

690
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,279
for example okay

691
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,159
so

692
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,640
my final case study turns our attention

693
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,120
to the newest platform to become host to

694
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,799
a variety of questionable or realistic

695
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,679
content tick tock

696
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,559
not yet a sales platform and currently

697
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,039
only permitting short form videos

698
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,960
it has created a new very different

699
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:19,919
means

700
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,240
by which content creators can reach vast

701
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:25,200
audiences in a public personality driven

702
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,840
very visual way

703
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,600
we are interested in examining what

704
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,600
happened when the archaeological and

705
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,760
osteological community

706
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,960
of users

707
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,960
was suddenly made more aware of the

708
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,279
platform as a place where human remains

709
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,520
traders can also advertise their

710
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,159
businesses show off collections and

711
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,640
steer interested purchasers elsewhere to

712
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,760
other platforms or to websites

713
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,960
in this case

714
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,799
videos released by a certain individual

715
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,840
last august mentioned earlier in my talk

716
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,919
became the catalyst to use currently

717
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,600
available scrapers

718
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,400
here andrew norton's tick tock scraper

719
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,320
was available at the time

720
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,400
as well as pixplot again

721
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,200
and topic modeling to deep dive into the

722
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,360
networks of interaction and response

723
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,720
that formed

724
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,480
in the comments section and between

725
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,559
accounts

726
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,360
so the visual left gives one example of

727
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,760
what sorts of topics were discussed

728
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,080
in videos and comments tagged with

729
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,880
hashtag bone talk

730
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,520
as direct pushback

731
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,600
by the archaeological community in

732
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,080
response to this this person's videos

733
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,799
going viral in the media

734
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:37,520
so

735
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,360
bones is unsurprisingly the central

736
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,000
theme of discussion in the corpus

737
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:42,880
but

738
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,760
note the nodes formed around tumblr and

739
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,799
bone thief suggest that a previous

740
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,200
instance of a grave robber being brought

741
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,960
to task in part via social media in 2016

742
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,480
on tumblr

743
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,640
is part of the collective memory of many

744
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,120
tick tock users who might follow this

745
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,760
individual and have since mostly become

746
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,880
critical of his ongoing selling under

747
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,960
the veneer of education

748
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,039
in the face of the moral ethical and

749
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,919
legal concerns that we as archaeologists

750
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,080
constantly try to raise about the the

751
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,000
trafficking of antiquities and human

752
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,440
remains

753
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,640
so

754
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,880
work of this nature i think is

755
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,279
rare but valuable and it shows that a

756
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,039
platform like tick tock that can offer

757
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,240
pushback

758
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,480
in a very different way than other

759
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,880
platforms used much more for no

760
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,279
questions asked selling like instagram

761
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,480
facebook or e-commerce platforms

762
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,480
here we have a case where

763
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,120
we can fight fire with fire a bit

764
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,360
and the networks that form in the vast

765
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,080
ecosystem of users of this platform

766
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,679
are only really approachable through

767
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,840
these kind of methods and we hope that

768
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,240
these kind of methods can then be turned

769
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,480
as a new way to look at the criminality

770
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,039
side of this activity a bit more

771
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:00,320
um

772
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,840
yeah so it's something that's really

773
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,440
observed

774
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,200
only so far on tick tock to our

775
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,559
knowledge we haven't seen it much

776
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,960
elsewhere but it's a tool we want to

777
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,880
explore

778
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,760
okay

779
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,840
so

780
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,360
to wrap it up

781
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,760
it behooves me to briefly mention a few

782
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,799
directions

783
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,279
that colleagues and i academic law

784
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,840
enforcement and ngo like might go in

785
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,520
future

786
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,440
partnerships will remain key

787
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,080
especially as we strongly suspect there

788
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,760
is much more illicit trafficking out

789
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,120
there than what we have found so far

790
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,360
i am also personally interested in

791
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:38,960
figuring out what can be ethically

792
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,720
discerned from

793
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,840
payment and geolocation metadata behind

794
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,840
what individual dealers may or may not

795
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,799
share

796
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,240
which is again something else that i

797
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,919
would like to talk to you as cyber

798
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,159
security professionals more about these

799
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,679
kind of directions

800
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,919
because it's a gap in our data and a gap

801
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,799
in our understanding

802
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,440
so assessing such information

803
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,279
as well as devising better ways to

804
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,679
discern connections between networks

805
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,120
that move different categories of

806
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:10,080
traffic goods would be useful to many

807
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,480
if it's possible to do so ethically and

808
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,440
keep it all anonymous as well

809
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,600
so the longer it takes for platforms

810
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,120
themselves to take these issues

811
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,240
seriously

812
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,360
the more outreach to policymakers and

813
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,799
the public and new research audiences

814
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:28,480
will be required

815
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,799
fundamentally without demand there is no

816
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:33,039
supply

817
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,360
okay

818
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,520
in this short summary talk

819
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,279
i hope you learned from me as much as i

820
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,640
have been learning from you throughout

821
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,159
this conference

822
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,760
if you want copies of any papers

823
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,000
mentioned in my talk or to read more

824
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,600
about what the alliance to counter crime

825
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:50,399
online or the bone trade project itself

826
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,640
are doing in more depth please visit the

827
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,720
websites listed here

828
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,360
i want to thank my funders or supporters

829
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,919
whoops they are the logos behind me

830
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,240
uh and

831
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,080
the cute little aliens there are

832
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,679
learning their own lessons about market

833
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,360
demand for the bone trade

834
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,919
but i want to end by thanking you all

835
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,480
for your attention to this maybe obscure

836
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,440
topic

837
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,200
and i hope that maybe this could open up

838
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,559
some fruitful

839
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,440
dialogue about how we can combine our

840
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,960
efforts to

841
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,440
bring your insights to

842
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,799
the program of research that we've

843
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,880
already started here and apply your

844
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,640
knowledge to maybe something that would

845
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,679
be new and exciting to you as well so on

846
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,080
that note thank you very much

847
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,559
and bye

848
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,600
thank you damian that was absolutely

849
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,840
fascinating stuff wasn't it wow thank

850
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,320
you i do have a couple questions online

851
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,559
uh i'll read out the first one so

852
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,120
your 2020 paper on this you mentioned

853
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,519
how selling of human remains is not

854
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,000
illegal in all jurisdictions when you

855
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,559
are scraping instagram for

856
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,440
the human remains for sale how did you

857
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,600
determine if they came from an area

858
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,000
where it was lawful as opposed to where

859
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,640
it was not

860
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,559
um that's a good question um

861
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,159
the collecting community has really kind

862
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:14,880
of

863
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,360
mythologized the idea that

864
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:20,080
uh it's only illegal in the us in

865
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,559
louisiana tennessee and georgia

866
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,559
and then they act that most other every

867
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,840
other states

868
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,919
and many other countries they just

869
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,320
assume carte blanche everything is fine

870
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,559
in our research and in others for

871
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,760
example tanya marsh in 2015 she's a law

872
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,039
professor

873
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,360
she wrote the law of human remains

874
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,679
even then pointing out that

875
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,880
there are 37 u.s states that have

876
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,200
variations of laws on the books that

877
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,799
would actually

878
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,720
come into play and have something to say

879
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,360
about the trade if they were enforced

880
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,360
let alone many other countries have

881
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,320
versions of these laws around

882
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,799
human remains as cultural property

883
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:02,720
sort of or human remains as health

884
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,919
issues or human remains as

885
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,240
an affront to the dignity of the dead

886
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,399
the laws kind of sit in these areas it's

887
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,080
a complicated mess

888
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,120
um

889
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,080
when we

890
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,360
that's a question when we do the

891
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,279
scraping

892
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:20,000
oftentimes at least on some platforms

893
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,799
they'll

894
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,559
be clear about

895
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,480
saying where they're posting and sending

896
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,679
from and

897
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,279
if they want to stand internationally or

898
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,240
not

899
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,760
they'll repeat that

900
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,640
no louisiana tennessee or georgia line

901
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,360
over and over but beyond that it seems

902
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,799
like

903
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,039
to their activities the world's pretty

904
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,279
open um

905
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,760
but fundamentally yes we have to go from

906
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,679
that you know end point of this process

907
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,080
and we're using data from

908
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,279
uh

909
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,640
what they are

910
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,039
presenting online so behind that they

911
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:57,039
could be lying of course but we just

912
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,480
have to go with

913
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,640
what the data says

914
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,080
um

915
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,519
because that's the that's the view that

916
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,440
we have and that's the view the tools

917
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,960
give us as well

918
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,960
but it's a complicated legal situation

919
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,800
for sure yes

920
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,199
uh and there's another question online

921
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:16,320
uh what outcomes in seizing items or

922
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,079
preventing illegal trades have you been

923
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,079
able to achieve yeah

924
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,960
um a few i've i've worked

925
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,520
with a few law enforcement cases so far

926
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,079
where they've had success in either at

927
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,839
least holding it holding the steez

928
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,520
material for a while if not getting it

929
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,040
forfeited

930
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,679
mostly like i said in the slide what we

931
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,119
as civilians

932
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,599
either echo or myself and the bone trade

933
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:40,639
project

934
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:43,040
we are more concerned with giving intel

935
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,399
and context

936
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,918
to our law enforcement colleagues in

937
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:46,879
general

938
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,800
and that's why we're taking this big

939
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,639
data approach to look at

940
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:53,119
the big picture as much as possible but

941
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,199
we only get to work on cases if we get

942
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,800
approached with cases

943
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:57,599
so

944
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,920
we have always kind of been the players

945
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,400
in the background that can help when

946
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,240
asked

947
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,160
much like you know in digital forensics

948
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,760
forensics contents

949
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,280
we can see

950
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:11,839
what's it we can see the forest for the

951
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:12,800
trees

952
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,520
but

953
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,520
we only get to look at certain trees if

954
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:17,839
we're pointed to that certain tree but

955
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:20,960
then sometimes the archives we have can

956
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,800
actually help them connect the dots

957
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,000
between

958
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,359
the seller

959
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,000
this was seized the seller lied on their

960
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,520
customs

961
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,359
can prove that this was actually offered

962
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:32,640
online

963
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,359
these times on these dates and that's

964
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:36,880
actually sometimes been useful

965
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,599
information to uh allow law enforcement

966
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:40,960
to move

967
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,160
more

968
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,800
directly on some of these people but it

969
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,880
doesn't happen enough and we hope in

970
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,200
future it will happen a lot more

971
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,720
excellent thank you with any other

972
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,680
questions around the room

973
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:56,880
uh there's one from me though um

974
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,440
have you found any countries

975
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,960
better or worse than others sort of

976
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,960
thing in in this type of

977
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,480
from like the law enforcement side but

978
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:08,560
then also from the trading side as well

979
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,400
from the trading side i think

980
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,400
it's a wild west kind of scenario

981
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,839
everywhere is open

982
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,040
um and

983
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,240
even if

984
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:20,000
a group or a seller

985
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,920
or a forum or whatever will say oh we

986
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,480
respect you know we don't ship to this

987
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,560
place because we respect the laws it

988
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,839
doesn't mean they won't for the right

989
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,920
price you know they could say one thing

990
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,359
online doesn't mean

991
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,680
behind the scenes they're not bypassing

992
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:35,839
it

993
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,400
for law enforcement

994
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,440
again

995
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,040
most countries

996
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,839
try to police this to some extent but it

997
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,520
just varies so much and

998
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,599
it's like some

999
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:49,920
not to pick anyone but for example

1000
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,000
uh belgium the netherlands i can think

1001
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,280
of two

1002
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,720
you know

1003
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,400
trafficking of human remains even the

1004
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,920
private market

1005
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,960
is quite almost quite legal it falls in

1006
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,480
there's a big gap in the law and you

1007
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,359
know it's

1008
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,040
whereas other countries try to restrict

1009
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,079
restrict it a bit more but

1010
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:09,440
that's a part of the problem that they

1011
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,119
face is

1012
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,599
because it happens so much online

1013
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,040
that can kind of

1014
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,240
bypass

1015
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,160
jurisdictions like and there's not

1016
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,480
enough people on the ground to

1017
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,520
detect

1018
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:24,400
you know shipments going through so very

1019
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,920
few is actually

1020
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,440
caught and

1021
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,040
seized off you know the market in

1022
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,280
transits that allows investigations to

1023
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,079
happen and these laws actually be tested

1024
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,280
in court

1025
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,720
and that's partly also why we try and do

1026
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,240
what we do because

1027
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,079
we can look at the online world as best

1028
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:43,119
as we can using these tools and others

1029
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:46,960
to give that context to say okay

1030
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,880
we can demonstrate

1031
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,040
a lot of people are collecting in

1032
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,880
america england

1033
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,200
various european countries australia

1034
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,040
there are many demand countries

1035
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,400
you guys know what the laws are

1036
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,560
currently in those countries we want to

1037
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,440
show you that the laws aren't being

1038
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,200
applied enough because there's a lot

1039
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,839
more moving and we can see

1040
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,440
evidence of that in like the online

1041
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,880
chatter if you will

1042
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:11,839
you know

1043
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,760
the frequency of people saying

1044
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,440
i just wrote you know i got they shipped

1045
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,960
me in the mail yesterday

1046
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,640
came in to me safely

1047
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,440
from the uk came to me in australia

1048
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,680
that's right there another point saying

1049
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,200
yep that shipment

1050
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,680
despite the laws despite the differences

1051
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,200
it made it through the post it got

1052
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,880
overseas it got to its buyer and

1053
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,560
you know that's another

1054
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,560
checkpoint in their favor if you will to

1055
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,119
show that they can circumvent these laws

1056
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:41,359
the laws need to

1057
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:43,680
catch up but more importantly the laws

1058
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,200
that are there just need to be enforced

1059
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,079
more that's more the question i think

1060
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:49,839

1061

round of applause for damien

1062
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,960

1063
