00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:32,880
thanks for joining us here in this

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,880
session obviously here to talk about

18
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,380
data security there's a number of

19
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,960
changes going on out there in the

20
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,420
regulatory world within government on

21
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,239
multiple fronts and given that this is

22
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,200
Oz cert and Chris and I hail from a very

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,440
technical slanted background and you

24
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,760
know the sessions here going on about

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,199
incident response and various other

26
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,640
technical topics we wanted to really

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,800
focus in on what it would mean to

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,719
Security Professionals based on a few

29
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,399
interesting things that Chris and I can

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,680
see coming down the line and what we

31
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,180
think that's going to change in terms of

32
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:08,640
our mindset where we need to focus and

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,380
we'll take a look at Australia we'll go

34
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,760
a little bit beyond Australia and then

35
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,900
and then bring it back to some

36
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,400
initiatives that are happening right now

37
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,500
but before I get into that maybe we'll

38
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,000
quickly introduce ourselves starting

39
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,979
with this gentleman to my right thanks

40
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:22,020
Steve I'm Chris Allen I'm the director

41
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,119
for advisory assurance and compliance at

42
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,820
Securo and so I spend my time helping

43
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,040
organizations to prepare pay for their

44
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,740
compliance obligations so I run the GRC

45
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,680
team at secure and also the technical

46
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,240
Assurance understanding so the

47
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,939
penetration testing and red teams or

48
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,560
work with me to help secure

49
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,780
organizations across Australia and

50
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,060
Singapore and these days are proud

51
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,799
queenslander too thank you very much yes

52
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,119
I am

53
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:50,340
and I'm Steve kvi I'm Australian by

54
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,720
background but I've lived in Singapore

55
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,000
for the last 10 years I'm the co-founder

56
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,579
of ground Labs we help organizations

57
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,520
around the world I've had a lot of

58
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,259
exposure to all sorts of organizations

59
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,180
and Chris and I have spent a lot of time

60
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,860
together out there working with clients

61
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,479
to help them understand their data

62
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,580
security posture and and help them

63
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:10,258
understand the types of data that

64
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,480
they're storing and we've seen a lot of

65
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,760
War Stories together and certainly

66
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,200
things we probably can't talk about in

67
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,200
detail but we've learned a lot as well

68
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,940
through through the process of having

69
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,620
worked together in in different

70
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,120
organizations and some of the other

71
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,920
things that I've seen around the world

72
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,200
and so I guess to to kick the discussion

73
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,160
off

74
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,319
um you know Chris you've you've done a

75
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,300
lot of security assessments over time

76
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,400
you've worked with government

77
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,080
organizations private organizations

78
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,180
large and small you've been involved in

79
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,280
incident response you you often get

80
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,140
called into an organization to help them

81
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,300
either improve their security posture or

82
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,700
be assessed to some kind of a standard

83
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,400
or achieve some sort of compliance why

84
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,780
in your view are you typically being

85
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,280
called in what's the what's the

86
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,900
motivator and the driver as to why

87
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,580
they're seeking your help yeah well I

88
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,680
think we posed the the question early on

89
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,319
in our preparation as well is the is the

90
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,700
Privacy Act that we've got here in

91
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,500
Australia driving that and I think the

92
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,260
reality is although we do have lots of

93
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,300
conversations with with colleagues about

94
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,940
the Privacy Act it's not really the the

95
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,860
motivator for the for a lot of the

96
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,900
conversation Nation

97
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,940
so you were doing say well if the

98
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,739
Privacy Act is is not the legislation

99
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:22,260
that people are making their decisions

100
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,540
on then then why are we talking to them

101
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,420
well it still is legislation driven

102
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,459
predominantly it's it's compliance

103
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,659
driven

104
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:34,500
um they are required to be cps234 a line

105
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,640
they're required to be following PCI DSS

106
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,159
that and that's driven by the by their

107
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:44,400
merchant Banks and they predominantly

108
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,400
are now needing to align to ISO 27001

109
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,040
where they're directly because it's a

110
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,840
contractor requirement or more

111
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,120
specifically for a lot of clients at the

112
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,519
moment around rffr

113
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:58,260
um so I think the the picture that I'm

114
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,599
trying to present is that

115
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,819
um many of our clients start their

116
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,799
conversations with secure around

117
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,780
compliance

118
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,700
um they're very familiar with the need

119
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,159
for penetration testing and we we have

120
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:13,799
lots of conversations around that but

121
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:14,939
predominantly the start of the

122
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:17,220
conversation is I need to comply with

123
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,918
with this thing so so you mentioned

124
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,839
obviously a key topic we wanted to touch

125
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,820
on here which is the Australian Privacy

126
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,419
Act of 1988 and you know when it comes

127
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:30,780
old yeah it's 34 years old it's a it's a

128
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,400
regulation that's been updated a lot

129
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,620
over time and there's been a couple of

130
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,720
really notable changes in the last

131
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,880
several years ones around something who

132
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,560
has heard of the Australian privacy

133
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,360
principles

134
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,520
good and who's familiar with the

135
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,400
notifiable data breach scheme fantastic

136
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,380
so we're off to a good start I think

137
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:52,320
yeah based on the audience here so

138
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,320
what we find is that there's been a lot

139
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,500
of changes to the Australian Privacy Act

140
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:01,740
but um you know probably I want more so

141
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,240
I want your view more so on this than

142
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,259
mine

143
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:06,120
are you being asked about it still given

144
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,039
all these recent changes you know and

145
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:09,960
that's really trying to up the ante and

146
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,699
and get Australian businesses and

147
00:05:11,699 --> 00:05:13,500
government to pay attention to the

148
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,060
Privacy Act and use it as the driving

149
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:17,340
force in how they manage people's

150
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,380
information are you are you being asked

151
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,960
to assess postures or look deeper into

152
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,699
that that channel

153
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,740
uh I guess I've been fortunate enough to

154
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,060
work with organizations in the

155
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,160
Consulting capacity for for more than 10

156
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,120
years

157
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,300
um and I still remember back to when the

158
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,300
notifiable data breach

159
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:38,100
scheme got through Parliament and I

160
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,900
guess consultants in the room probably

161
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,460
did a bit of a fist pump hoping that

162
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,320
well that was going to be the next lever

163
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,259
that we could pull to really get the

164
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:47,820
attention of clients so that we could

165
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:51,840
help them I think the reality is that we

166
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,780
didn't really see that

167
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,940
we didn't really see the momentum pick

168
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,860
up off the back of that I think we all

169
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,259
thought was going to come as a as a

170
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:02,880
professional

171
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,860
um and so I I guess we questioned well

172
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,500
why why was that the case as we were as

173
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,199
we were preparing and I think that the

174
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:13,860
the reality for me is that organizations

175
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,020
still don't necessarily

176
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,240
feel the pain or understand the pain

177
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,639
associated with with not complying with

178
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,500
with the ACT we've got a we've got a

179
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,419
number of colleagues that Focus their

180
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:27,180
attention in in privacy and no work very

181
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,460
closely with with complying with the

182
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:31,199
apps

183
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,060
um but it's very much a round business

184
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,240
process and and how they treat the data

185
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,639
rather than how they secure the data and

186
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,979
obviously being business resilient cyber

187
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:43,139
security professionals that I guess

188
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:44,819
that's where we spend most of our time

189
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:47,039
so it sounds like in some cases they

190
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,440
bring you in for a standard over here or

191
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,139
a driver over here where perhaps there's

192
00:06:51,139 --> 00:06:54,360
greater consequences or very specific

193
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,060
penalties or an inability to do business

194
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,220
within your given industry and that's

195
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,020
their driver in the first place and

196
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,660
perhaps some of the outcomes from that

197
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,180
overlap to somewhat and in helping them

198
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:08,460
with meeting the the Privacy Act and and

199
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,020
whatnot but

200
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,520
at the same time what you're telling me

201
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,979
is that they're not fully putting the

202
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:15,360
Privacy Act on the table and saying we

203
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,280
need help with this yeah no I think that

204
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,020
that's that's a fast

205
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,180
um summary of it I guess where where we

206
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,280
do start a conversation much more

207
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,020
actively is around something like PCI

208
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,880
DSS where the

209
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,400
um where the stakeholders can really I

210
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,139
guess appreciate and understand the

211
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:34,440
consequence or rfafr right if if you

212
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,940
don't have that alignment then the

213
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,639
business is not coming your way so I

214
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,080
guess it's a little bit like speeding

215
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,280
phones right if you drive through a

216
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,840
speed camera does it really change you

217
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,940
and change your action but if you get

218
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,919
pulled over by the by the cop at the

219
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:48,539
side of the road it really does help to

220
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,639
cement the the activity so ask

221
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,740
criminality so I think that that's why

222
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,960
the notifiable data breach scheme didn't

223
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,599
really drive that that momentum of

224
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,759
changing the cyber security space that

225
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,319
we were actually we were expecting

226
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:03,300
awareness in a way but you obviously

227
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,740
work with organizations all over the

228
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,360
world and obviously everyone's probably

229
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,360
familiar with with gdpr so what do you

230
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,900
what do you see are you seeing privacy

231
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,879
requirements driving

232
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,860
data security

233
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,500
requirements internationally it's a it's

234
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,180
an interesting question so again I'll

235
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,560
throw out to the audience just briefly

236
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,340
who here is somewhat familiar with gdpr

237
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,500
that's more than I expected who here

238
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,780
knows CCPA

239
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,539
they're the consultants in the room

240
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,240
so and and the funny so the last acronym

241
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,779
I just gave you is California's latest

242
00:08:38,779 --> 00:08:42,120
Privacy Act to protect its citizens data

243
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,679
and and just for more fun they're

244
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,660
changing that acronym to cpra next year

245
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,220
in 2023 they're going from the

246
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,320
California consumer's Privacy Act to the

247
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,019
California consumer privacy rights act

248
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:55,320
so um you know I think on an

249
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,200
international level firstly let me say

250
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,540
that it's a challenge

251
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,339
um you know I think the the Revelation

252
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:04,200
for a lot of organizations today no

253
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,880
matter where you are in the world is

254
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,980
that it's not it's no longer necessarily

255
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:10,560
about the regulations that exist in the

256
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,600
country where you are domiciled it's

257
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,700
about the regulations that exist where

258
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,980
your customers are domiciled so if

259
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:19,080
you're collecting data from customers in

260
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,600
other countries it's not just a case of

261
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,580
complying with your own local laws it's

262
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,620
a case of understanding what their laws

263
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,240
are and what you have to be ready for

264
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,800
should there be an incident or if

265
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,380
something goes wrong and so you know to

266
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,899
take the US very briefly that's a real

267
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,700
challenge because there is no National

268
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,760
legislation around privacy at the moment

269
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,740
every single state is looking at

270
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,440
implementing their own local legislation

271
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,019
on how you as a business or organization

272
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,200
have to protect the data of citizens of

273
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,760
that state and so at the moment

274
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,860
California's passed law Colorado's past

275
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,240
law there's New York law and there's I

276
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,339
think it's 11 or 12. don't quote me on

277
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:57,959
that but we're definitely not at 50

278
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:00,959
states and the belief is is that in the

279
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,640
next number of years before all states

280
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,920
eventually figure it out the federal

281
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,540
Parliament will come out with its own

282
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,220
law and then we'll have to go comply

283
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,079
with that but that that's you know

284
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,480
that's just a mess on its own the the

285
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,100
bigger one that we most commonly hear of

286
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,620
is the gdpr I like to think of it as

287
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,120
kind of the gold standard in the world

288
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,100
it is probably the toughest rate

289
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,860
regulation to try and comply with as far

290
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:25,140
as personal information and making sure

291
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,640
you're collecting or correctly handling

292
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,540
it correctly and securing it correctly

293
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,740
um the the gdpr has this concept of

294
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,720
adequacy so when you're trying to

295
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,720
measure the gdpr against other privacy

296
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,060
laws around the world only 11 other

297
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,220
countries have been deemed as having

298
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,160
adequate privacy laws against the gdpr

299
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,500
which makes cross-border transfer of

300
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,600
personal information easier because it

301
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,980
just means if you comply with your local

302
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,019
law then you can move data around and

303
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:56,760
it's okay if you're not one of those 11

304
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,339
countries and Australia is not one of

305
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,160
those 11 countries

306
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,380
then then you've got to go to some extra

307
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,320
steps if you intend to bring information

308
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,839
of Europeans into Australia and store it

309
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,459
here so you know think of a worst case

310
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:13,320
scenario maybe you're a data backup

311
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,240
provider or some sort of cloud provider

312
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,240
and you have a European customer and

313
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,579
some of their data ends up on servers

314
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,019
that you're running or responsible for

315
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:24,300
here in Australia you you have

316
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,220
additional things that you have to do as

317
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,500
a result without diving into all the

318
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,779
nuances and comparisons there are some

319
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:32,899
fundamental mental differences between

320
00:11:32,899 --> 00:11:35,579
why Australia's Privacy Law is where it

321
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:37,620
is at the moment and what the gdpr

322
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,320
requires you to do simple things like

323
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,899
you know on a non-security front you've

324
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,120
all seen the the cookie pop-ups now

325
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,200
that's probably why a lot of you have

326
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,620
heard and seen gdpr under gdpr you must

327
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:52,200
get someone's implied consent to collect

328
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,480
their information you can't just Auto

329
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,019
tick I accept boxes on a form you must

330
00:11:58,019 --> 00:11:59,579
get them to actually tick the box to say

331
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:01,800
yes I agree to the terms and conditions

332
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,000
in Australia it's the other way around

333
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,440
at the moment you can get away with

334
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,920
implied consent and a few other things

335
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,660
on the other front from an incident

336
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,519
response standpoint which you know it

337
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,339
all cert it's always a topic of interest

338
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:16,860
if you suffer an incident that involves

339
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,959
personal data personal information under

340
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:21,060
the gdpr you have to be able to respond

341
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,399
in 72 hours and notify the regulator

342
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:25,620
with as much information you can about

343
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,360
what's happened including an

344
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,040
approximation of how many records you've

345
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,660
lost and so on and then start the

346
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,620
incident

347
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,839
in Australia under the notifiable data

348
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,940
breaches scheme we're a little bit more

349
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,740
easy going at the moment I believe it's

350
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,459
30 days is considered reasonable and um

351
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:42,839
this is you know there's a number of

352
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:45,240
different reasons as to why gdpr looked

353
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,040
at Australia's current version of the

354
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,600
Privacy Law and went well we don't quite

355
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,820
consider you adequate enough so I think

356
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,519
you know Australian businesses you know

357
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,560
imagine if gdpr was introduced in

358
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,779
Australia I think organizations would

359
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:00,060
have an uphill battle based on where

360
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,940
they currently stand yeah and um it's

361
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,700
funny many of the conversations that uh

362
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,339
that's that start in my world with

363
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:10,500
organizations around privacy as the as

364
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,399
the driver for that start with gdpr or

365
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:15,959
we want to we do work with or we want to

366
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:18,420
work with with data from Europe and what

367
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,459
does that mean for us and and that

368
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:21,959
really then starts that conversation

369
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:23,760
about

370
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,279
um improving the the posture and and

371
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:29,100
really understanding uh what it means

372
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,139
for them and I think what it means for

373
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:32,940
them becomes quite hair raising when you

374
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,279
talk about the penalties associated with

375
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,380
gdpr and I think you've you've worked

376
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,940
with some clients in the past that have

377
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,519
got the same shock right yeah

378
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,500
um look obviously I think there's two

379
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,420
motives here there's obviously driving

380
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,040
businesses to do the right thing with

381
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,279
people's individual data but um the

382
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:51,540
other side of it is attacking big Tech

383
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,680
obviously there's been a lot of bad

384
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,480
press on big Tech having too much

385
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,100
control you know I think the Cambridge

386
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,980
analytica incident years ago was was a

387
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:02,820
catalyst to really driving forth the um

388
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,040
the the Privacy narrative across the

389
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,839
world in particular but Europe really

390
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,300
used that as yet another example to say

391
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,360
this is why we need to put the privacy

392
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,459
of citizens way up the top compared to

393
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:15,959
where it's been in the past you know I'm

394
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:17,160
sure all of you in this room can

395
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,139
remember a time where it was the Wild

396
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:21,180
West the more information you could

397
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,980
collect about an individual the better

398
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,019
maybe you can figure out more insights

399
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:26,639
maybe we can do other forms of marketing

400
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,100
to them and that's completely flipped in

401
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,720
this world of regulation in fact the UN

402
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,199
came out and said now I believe it's 134

403
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:37,440
countries have modern privacy regulation

404
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,880
that they're either working on or have

405
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,800
in place that's this is a complete

406
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,959
Quantum shift from where we've ever been

407
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:45,120
um compared to in the past and so on on

408
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,500
the fines and regulation front that's

409
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,720
obviously what drives organizations to

410
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,899
do something and um I understand now

411
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:53,760
that in the last number of years since

412
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,699
gdpr enforcements have been applied the

413
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:58,500
penalties have exceeded over a billion

414
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,560
dollars from the regulator now a lot a

415
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,060
lot of that is weighted heavily to Big

416
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,820
Tech but there are a number of smaller

417
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,620
organizations that are being fined

418
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,600
considerable amounts relative to their

419
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,519
revenue and their size because under

420
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,440
gdpr you can be fined up to four percent

421
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,899
of your Global Revenue depending on how

422
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:19,519
severe the breach is or 10 million euros

423
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,620
in the I guess more locally what we're

424
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,839
seeing some we're seeing some proposed

425
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,660
changes in the Privacy

426
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,880
regulation in terms of the penalties are

427
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,160
going up at least as a proposal the

428
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,720
penalties up from a couple of million

429
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,360
dollars to 10 million dollars and and to

430
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,680
do things like set a maximum of uh 10 of

431
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,360
your Australian Revenue

432
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,399
so there are some signals there where

433
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,500
they want to make the the teeth you know

434
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,300
stronger in terms of getting people to

435
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,459
pay more attention to the the Privacy

436
00:15:50,459 --> 00:15:52,680
Act but there are a number of other

437
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,320
propositions coming down the line that

438
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,600
in in my reading really makes it sound

439
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,160
like we could be heading towards a

440
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,079
privacy act that reads a bit like the

441
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:04,139
gdpr which in real terms would mean that

442
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:05,699
your average Australian organization

443
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:09,120
needs to become very aware of the

444
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,399
personal data that they're holding where

445
00:16:11,399 --> 00:16:13,800
it is what types of personal data that

446
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,079
you're holding what's really sensitive

447
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,060
what versus what's normal types of

448
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,399
personal data and then if something bad

449
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,380
were to happen to make sure you're in a

450
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,759
position to be able to respond very

451
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:26,279
quickly and be able to get to each

452
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:28,320
individual subject and tell them that

453
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,120
you have had an incident that that

454
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,339
impacts them and you can articulate what

455
00:16:32,339 --> 00:16:34,740
you believe that impact is so there's

456
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,820
there's definitely some interesting

457
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,139
movements that we're seeing on that

458
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:40,079
front just on the Privacy Act but I

459
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,100
think we're seeing some interesting

460
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,800
movements across

461
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,959
not all of government policy right so we

462
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:48,839
we have the Australian dollar strategy

463
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:50,880
um looking to help the economy grow

464
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,339
based on maximizing the value of data

465
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:55,380
right so I think when I look when I when

466
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,300
I look at the the Privacy Act for me it

467
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,699
really resonates around making sure that

468
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:02,180
we're doing the right thing with

469
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:04,319
personalized identifiable information

470
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,020
and I think given its age it's it's

471
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,059
really Nev it wasn't really focused on

472
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:10,740
the value of that information and it's

473
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,439
obviously been commoditized by

474
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,780
um by criminals

475
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,059
um to a greater extent and I guess it

476
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:19,859
continues to be of interest to nation

477
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:22,020
states as well so we've seen a shift in

478
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,579
the in the threat

479
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:26,039
um and the and the value of of that data

480
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:27,780
obviously

481
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,059
um the the the second tenant of the data

482
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:32,100
strategy is obviously around uh trust

483
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,419
and protection and I think that's been

484
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,880
an underlying theme of privacy acts

485
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,740
around the world but let me bring up a

486
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,539
slide actually on the national data

487
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:40,860
security action plan because I think

488
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:43,679
that's uh this is a key change that that

489
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,840
we've certainly seen on other fronts and

490
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,760
it seems quite timely given that there's

491
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,280
a review of the Privacy Act that's been

492
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,419
going it's actually been going on since

493
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:52,799
2019

494
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:53,940
um and the government's collected a lot

495
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,160
of feedback but now the government's

496
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,140
come out with the the national data

497
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,720
security action plan and um what's

498
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,820
really interesting is that it only this

499
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,440
is a discussion paper at this stage it's

500
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,600
not legislation they're calling for

501
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,400
feedback they put it out at the end of

502
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,100
last year and we all have until next

503
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,640
month uh what June 10 I think uh June

504
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,059
10th yeah June 10 to to provide feedback

505
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:21,000
on some of the thoughts and ideas and

506
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,919
approaches that are being talked about

507
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:25,260
in in this discussion paper and we put

508
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,840
the url url up there for you all or you

509
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,280
can just Google it national data

510
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,340
security action plan but um it's I think

511
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,799
this is a a new approach to thinking

512
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,840
about a problem that hasn't really been

513
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,940
addressed on a national level that's

514
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,380
certainly one of the things I picked up

515
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,299
on it what did you think about it yeah

516
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:43,620
no absolutely

517
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,059
um and I think this goes to that that

518
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:49,020
final tenant of the the data strategy

519
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,179
um which is obviously enabling data use

520
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:54,660
right so we know that organizations are

521
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,120
collecting more and more data whether it

522
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,919
be personalized identifiable information

523
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:02,580
but just data in general right we uh as

524
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,400
the knowledge economy continues to grow

525
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,580
data is going to become incredibly

526
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,720
incredibly value

527
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,880
um valuable to all Australian

528
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,799
organizations and

529
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:16,440
I think it's interesting that the home

530
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,480
Affairs department has really put this

531
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,000
paper out there for some discussion

532
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,740
um I when I read it it's quite

533
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,660
interesting that they

534
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,760
um they seem in my opinion to focus much

535
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,520
more on the the confidentiality of the

536
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,160
data and obviously that goes back to the

537
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,539
the idea of value making sure that the

538
00:19:36,539 --> 00:19:39,660
um that that we understand that data is

539
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,360
is kept secure that that the use of it

540
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,880
is accountable that the use of it is um

541
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,980
is controlled yeah it's and again this

542
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,660
is not a standard or a regulation this

543
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,640
is a discussion paper but the themes

544
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,039
that I I saw coming out of it weren't

545
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,919
all about cyber security it wasn't all

546
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,539
about confidentiality Integrity

547
00:19:57,539 --> 00:20:00,419
availability it was about data security

548
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:03,120
it was about really focusing on

549
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,059
how are we securing the underlying data

550
00:20:06,059 --> 00:20:08,340
down to almost the record level you know

551
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,900
it would be my interpretation I think

552
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,460
when we think about security

553
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,799
particularly in cyber and whatnot we're

554
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:16,320
thinking about securing applications

555
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,020
networks infrastructure and then when it

556
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,640
comes to data we're thinking about maybe

557
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,799
securing data repositories as a whole

558
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,720
but without necessarily understanding

559
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,780
anything beneath that and really what

560
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,220
some of the themes are that we're seeing

561
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,919
in this paper is is very much around not

562
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,480
just Concepts that you would expect to

563
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,580
see in more mature organizations but

564
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,640
across most types of organizations and

565
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,200
saying well how would your average

566
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,620
business in Australia truly understand

567
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:45,419
all the data that is collected about

568
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:47,520
individuals but I think the paper also

569
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:48,539
goes a little bit further Beyond

570
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:51,240
personal as well to say other data that

571
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,400
you have is is highly valuable like like

572
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,400
IP because you know again you mentioned

573
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,159
Nation States before

574
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:01,919
the sovereignty of rip is a huge problem

575
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,960
the government certainly wants to

576
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,240
encourage motivate and help wherever

577
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,419
possible organizations to help lock down

578
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:11,000
and protect and understand

579
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,260
valuable data you know I think that's

580
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:15,179
again one of the other themes but I

581
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:17,039
found in particular very interesting a

582
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:19,980
very strong tone around how you're

583
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,500
protecting data generally zero in on

584
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,539
personal data and and definitely some

585
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,880
connection with the Privacy Act but I

586
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,740
don't necessarily think one of the

587
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:31,500
outputs from this process will be that

588
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,480
this replaces the Privacy Act maybe

589
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,340
there might be some influence into what

590
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,100
happens to the Privacy Act but what we

591
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,200
could very well see is some some

592
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,720
guidance or even some frame work around

593
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,360
helping businesses understand how to

594
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,940
secure data in a more broader sense and

595
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,740
not just businesses government as well

596
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:52,799
yeah well absolutely and I guess

597
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,100
part of the discussion calls for how

598
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,620
governments can can sort of further help

599
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,900
and support businesses to understand the

600
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,720
value the value of their data and uplift

601
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,659
that data security and posture and I

602
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,000
think that that's uh that's the natural

603
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,600
progression right so

604
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,340
we started talking about the Privacy Act

605
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,980
and we obviously talked about gdpr and I

606
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,960
think that the gdpr discussion is very

607
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,039
much around the cost of non-compliance

608
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:25,620
but I think that the the opportunity

609
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:28,440
here uh with this with this plan with

610
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,780
the discussion paper is really to start

611
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:33,840
to help all organizations whether they

612
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,780
be small or multinational

613
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,880
um really hone in on the value of of

614
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,740
data right

615
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,200
um yeah actually in the so I just

616
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,240
grabbed one piece of paper from the from

617
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,940
this discussion paper it's page 27 it's

618
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,940
basically the final call for views that

619
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:52,679
they on what they want feedback on

620
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:53,880
they've asked some very specific

621
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:58,559
questions uh 15 all in all and um again

622
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,620
we're not here to Deep dive on on heavy

623
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,179
topics but there's a couple of questions

624
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:04,980
that both of us kind of looked at and

625
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,200
thought let's um let's quickly have a

626
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,700
chat about just a few specific things

627
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,919
that we think are relevant and one of

628
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:13,020
those questions questions was how can

629
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,340
the Australian government further

630
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,159
support your business to understand the

631
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:19,860
value of data and uplift your data

632
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,440
security posture what are your initial

633
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,820
thoughts on that question Chris

634
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:27,780
I think that we've got a fantastic

635
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:31,020
opportunity for for our government to

636
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:34,220
really help us understand

637
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:37,260
what is happening across our whole

638
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:39,480
economy right I think governments in a

639
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,600
in a in an enviable position to be able

640
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,600
to see what's happening in so many

641
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,640
different organizations if for nothing

642
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,860
else being able to judge the value of an

643
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,779
organization and then really help those

644
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:53,720
business owners to connect

645
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,880
the value of their organization back to

646
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,659
the data that they that they rely upon

647
00:23:59,659 --> 00:24:03,360
we we all pay tax organizations they pay

648
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,279
their tax based on on obviously on

649
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,240
profit

650
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,059
and so being able to being able to share

651
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:13,520
with them use cases around how much data

652
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,600
attributes to the value of that

653
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,299
organization and show that across

654
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:20,220
different industry sectors because I

655
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,620
think the the value of data to

656
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,960
businesses is clearly very different in

657
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,600
in many different sectors and we can

658
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,880
government can help us to understand and

659
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,240
join that those dots together

660
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,820
and how security can then help in terms

661
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,600
of

662
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,520
maintaining the value of that data and

663
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,440
not losing that data I think there's a

664
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,360
saying out there some of you guys have

665
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,720
seen it I'm sure data is the new oil and

666
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,940
it's commonly understood now and in fact

667
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,100
accepted that businesses and

668
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,260
organizations governments have

669
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,500
never had such valuable data in fact

670
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,059
it's probably in many cases the most

671
00:24:57,059 --> 00:24:58,620
valuable asset that they're sitting on

672
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,140
and yet many organizations don't fully

673
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,659
understand all of those assets that they

674
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:06,179
hold and so I think you know whatever

675
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:09,000
comes out of this this action plan you

676
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,559
know I think what what we can hope is

677
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:13,380
that it'll it'll bring Focus back to

678
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:15,059
setting some some standardized

679
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:18,179
approaches on what businesses can do to

680
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:20,400
to secure data rather than secure

681
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,260
infrastructure you know get out of that

682
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,240
firewall mentality get out of that

683
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,580
building the strongest tallest walls

684
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,020
around your organization around your

685
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,000
network as a strategy to protect

686
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,460
whatever is inside it but if by chance

687
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,100
someone found their way inside then it's

688
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,539
open slather and they can see everything

689
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:38,880
and access a lot of things that they

690
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,919
probably shouldn't be able to so moving

691
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:43,440
away from that mentality you know in in

692
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,059
organizations that perhaps don't have as

693
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:48,059
a mature I.T capability as larger

694
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:49,559
organizations although both of us have

695
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:51,059
seen larger organizations that suffer

696
00:25:51,059 --> 00:25:53,820
from the same same problem you mentioned

697
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,159
tax so I just you reminded me of the the

698
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:58,559
tax office you know think about the ATO

699
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:01,740
right now you know the ATO is a heavily

700
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,539
dependent on Department because they're

701
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:04,919
effectively responsible for Revenue

702
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:06,840
collection of the country so therefore

703
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,720
they go to a lot of effort to

704
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,539
teach and train and maintain knowledge

705
00:26:12,539 --> 00:26:15,419
across both the financial community in

706
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:17,640
in business and also in the professional

707
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,159
Community who are advising businesses

708
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,320
and individuals on how to comply with

709
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,960
tax laws and it almost seems like one of

710
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,580
the areas that government could really

711
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,820
focus on is is how to better educate and

712
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,980
how to better support the the IT

713
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,260
professional community and perhaps even

714
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,320
the the Prof the security Consulting

715
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,900
community in having a standardized way

716
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,440
of how to help organizations because at

717
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,120
the moment you know depending on which

718
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,580
standard you're complying with you know

719
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:49,320
there's consistency within a standard

720
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,419
but there is not consistency across all

721
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:52,500
the different standards and all the

722
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,760
different regulations because they have

723
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,080
different motives different goals

724
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,539
different aims you know we mentioned PCI

725
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:00,240
before that really only cares about the

726
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,760
card number the credit card number it

727
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:04,620
doesn't have any care about any other

728
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,779
forms of personal information so the

729
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:08,580
fact that we're talking about a national

730
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,100
plan that that again focuses on a

731
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,320
variety of different data types is I

732
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,059
think a good thing but certainly it'll

733
00:27:15,059 --> 00:27:16,620
be need to be underpinned by education

734
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:19,620
and and a lot more awareness than than

735
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,500
say the Privacy Act has right now yeah

736
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,240
look I think

737
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,880
and then

738
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:28,860
the the the the ATO has a bunch of rules

739
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,360
but I think if you look at it from a

740
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,100
from a principal's point of view then

741
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,840
it's it's much easier to apply across

742
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,140
many different organizations right today

743
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,580
it's very difficult for an organization

744
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,740
to really decide okay should I go should

745
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:47,220
I follow Iraq should I follow 27001 is

746
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,080
essential eight for me right there's a

747
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,659
lot of different options and I think if

748
00:27:51,659 --> 00:27:54,000
if government's able to help us to set

749
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,520
out some some key principles about what

750
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,559
does it take to to achieve data security

751
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:01,440
and show organizations what good looks

752
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,620
like then we can take away a lot of the

753
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,960
the guessing work that many of our

754
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,580
clients sort of started maybe there's

755
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,320
even a role for organizations like Oz

756
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,480
cert and other non-profit security

757
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,520
focused organizations to play a part in

758
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,740
that yeah and I think the other I think

759
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,659
the other thing the government can do is

760
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:21,000
is really start to help organizations

761
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,779
understand the threat and to ident to be

762
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:26,399
able to identify the impact of that

763
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,679
threat upon them much quicker right we

764
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:30,600
all wake up we check the weather we get

765
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,640
an update on the weather report at the

766
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,740
end of the day and it's real-time

767
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:37,080
information and we can make a call based

768
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,419
on on what we're seeing storytelling

769
00:28:39,419 --> 00:28:41,279
yeah teaching people through

770
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:42,720
storytelling just actually a quick

771
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,940
example you reminded me of is when I did

772
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,360
my my Sans G Pen many moons ago my

773
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,340
instructor who flew from the US out here

774
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,740
to Australia while you know in between

775
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,720
sessions he was showing us some of the

776
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,240
live incident response data that they

777
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,799
were getting because he was on the Sans

778
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,080
incident response team and he was

779
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,299
showing us a collector node that they

780
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:04,799
that had been discovered inside the

781
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,020
university and he was just showing us

782
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,059
samples of what that collector node was

783
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:10,919
getting from all of these obviously

784
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:12,360
malware instances that have been

785
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,380
deployed and it was showing us very very

786
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,779
specific dossiers of individuals where

787
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:20,220
they they had managed to collect

788
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,860
someone's name their Bank credentials

789
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:25,260
their email credentials their Facebook

790
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,820
and Myspace page because it was a little

791
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:30,360
while ago now and um and a variety of

792
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,179
other very specific things including

793
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:36,059
some deeply personal uh habits that that

794
00:29:36,059 --> 00:29:37,919
person had based on the sort of websites

795
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,559
that they were going to and I had never

796
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,740
seen such a concise uh dossier of an

797
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,899
individual and I am absolutely sure that

798
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:47,580
this person had no idea that this had

799
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,640
been collected and again you see things

800
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,559
like that firsthand but it completely

801
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,020
changes your mindset in in motivating

802
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,299
you to want to do something about it and

803
00:29:57,299 --> 00:29:58,919
it's almost like we need the same

804
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:00,899
Approach at government level how are we

805
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,360
constantly educating

806
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,679
businesses on the real life things that

807
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:06,299
are happening but in a much more

808
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:08,039
real-time way yeah well it comes back to

809
00:30:08,039 --> 00:30:10,260
the example of of the police officer and

810
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:12,480
the speeding phone right I think

811
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,220
um there's probably research out there

812
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,840
that shows that when you get stopped you

813
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,880
change your action a lot quicker

814
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,200
um there was one other question I wanted

815
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,299
to jump to if that's okay Chris so um

816
00:30:21,299 --> 00:30:23,279
again in the in the call for views

817
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,980
there's a question about what steps can

818
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,779
your business take to understand the

819
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:30,419
value of the data they process or store

820
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:33,179
and do businesses have sufficient

821
00:30:33,179 --> 00:30:34,679
awareness of their data security

822
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:35,880
obligations

823
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,740
I think you know I mean this really hits

824
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,020
home for me and lays back onto a lot of

825
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,580
what we talked about but what I mean

826
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,620
what's your what's your thought on this

827
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:44,820
particular question that they put out

828
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,840
there

829
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,960
yeah I think I think businesses

830
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,059
I think businesses really have started

831
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:54,539
to appreciate that cyber security data

832
00:30:54,539 --> 00:30:57,299
security data is cyber resilience is an

833
00:30:57,299 --> 00:31:00,179
important aspect of um I've been in in

834
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:04,640
business today but I I still feel that

835
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,940
joining the dots between the the the the

836
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,559
value of what you've got the

837
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,299
dependencies that you have on your on

838
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:14,220
your data and the ability to run your

839
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,140
company

840
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,200
and the impacts of that are are still

841
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,779
unknown for for for many organizations

842
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:25,320
and when I say that right we we have a

843
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,539
very broad economy and many of our

844
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:30,000
colleagues here today uh work for those

845
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,919
larger organizations that have a

846
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,080
security team but we work with we also

847
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,880
work with organizations that really

848
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,860
don't have that access to a full

849
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,600
security team

850
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,760
um and so the the start of many of those

851
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,980
conversations is well what does this

852
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,740
mean to me why why would I care

853
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,960
um I I I if I had a dollar for every

854
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,700
time I I hear the the phrase well

855
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,320
hackers aren't interested in me I've got

856
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,080
nothing worth worth stealing um I'd

857
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,320
probably be able to retire so yeah I

858
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,360
don't I I think that there's still a

859
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,980
long way to go in terms of helping

860
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,799
people understand why cyber is important

861
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,380
to their business yeah absolutely and I

862
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:08,880
think that layers into a little stat

863
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,399
that we've collected in recent times

864
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:14,340
which is that ground Labs does a lot of

865
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,200
different things out there running web

866
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,760
hours pulling groups of people together

867
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,440
and we very often ask the simple

868
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,480
question to try and keep it as as

869
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,820
specific as possible which is do you

870
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,679
believe your organization knows we're at

871
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,559
stalling storing all of its data and so

872
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:31,440
around 70 of those respondents will say

873
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,240
no we really don't think our

874
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,519
organization knows where all of its data

875
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,500
is and I think that just brings back to

876
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,419
what one of the key elements of this

877
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:41,100
this plan is trying to bring to the

878
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,559
surface because prior to this there

879
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:45,539
wasn't really a strong narrative

880
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:47,700
certainly in Australia that was telling

881
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,799
every business do you really understand

882
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:52,919
all the data that you have you know

883
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:54,720
putting aside any specific regulations

884
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,480
and certainly our evidence says that

885
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,880
even today you know in the year 2022

886
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,700
there are so many organizations that up

887
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,460
until now even mature Security Programs

888
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:09,000
and privacy programs have often taken a

889
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,240
manual approach to trying to figure out

890
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,039
where information is ending up across

891
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:15,600
the business and it's fairly

892
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,519
straightforward data mapping process go

893
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,679
talk to each head of department or each

894
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:20,880
major stakeholder across the

895
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,760
organization and say hey Chris so you're

896
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,500
on customer service can you tell me what

897
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,360
personal information you guys are

898
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,039
collecting and how you're collecting it

899
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,600
and what Fields you're collecting and

900
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,919
you know just show me your business

901
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,899
workflow and just get stored anywhere

902
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:37,200
else apart from this CRM system and so

903
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,580
um you know you'll get a bunch of

904
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,799
answers they probably sound like pretty

905
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,539
good answers and you'll do that across

906
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:44,220
every other part of the organization and

907
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,440
effectively draw up a plan on saying

908
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,299
right well now we know where all the the

909
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:50,519
risk areas are let's now go put in some

910
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:52,620
controls to address those risks and

911
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,679
bring the risks down and you know

912
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,260
unfortunately and very often data

913
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,059
breaches will still happen to

914
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:01,500
organizations that have undergone that

915
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:05,039
kind of process and very often it's the

916
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,200
the data that they were not aware of

917
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,119
that was the data that was so easily

918
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,239
stolen when unfortunately the the time

919
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,980
came and someone did find a way into

920
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,079
their business or their Network similar

921
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:17,940
experience from what you've seen out in

922
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,859
the field yeah looking it's a complex

923
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:22,440
problem right you you describe the

924
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,139
manual process there of looking go talk

925
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,960
to people map it out draw it out

926
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:30,179
and often then it that's kind of where

927
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:33,418
it stops I did an exercise with with a

928
00:34:33,418 --> 00:34:35,040
colleague a few years ago where we we

929
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,320
tried to map out okay what information

930
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,020
do what information is of value to us

931
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,960
individually personally and and where is

932
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,119
it right and it's it's a mind-boggling

933
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,639
exercise right it you have all the

934
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,960
obvious ones right you have your email

935
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,639
and you use your email for your Banking

936
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,079
and so there's a connection there but

937
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:53,820
then okay you've got you've got three

938
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,260
hard drives in the back of the cupboard

939
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,420
that's got family photos on and what

940
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,660
he's doing 10 USB sticks and those

941
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,520
things turn up in the weirdest of places

942
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:06,780
don't they say yeah yeah so um I think

943
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,640
that I think that it has to start with

944
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,800
the with the with the manual but a

945
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,280
manual approach but I think we also need

946
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,240
a a more systematic approach to yeah to

947
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,339
evolve and clarify and check what we

948
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:22,020
what we understand sort of layers onto

949
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,520
the whole discussion that many of you

950
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,900
have heard about which is how do we make

951
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:27,900
security a BAU process how do we build

952
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,700
build it into every business process so

953
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,740
it's not an exception based approach

954
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,839
it's not when we go look then we uncover

955
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,579
it's something that automatically

956
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:37,440
happens all the time inside the business

957
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,240
in every process and every new platform

958
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,720
application acquisition even and and

959
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,880
when things are not the way they are

960
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,740
supposed to be there are proactive

961
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,540
alerts generated as opposed to finding

962
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,339
it out during the next assessment or the

963
00:35:50,339 --> 00:35:53,339
next audit it's it's

964
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:54,960
um and again we could probably talk for

965
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,700
hours on this in terms of the examples

966
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,859
we've both seen you know I've certainly

967
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:01,020
and you have to have had organizations

968
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,540
that have said those systems we are not

969
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,400
storing anything okay we've already

970
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,160
looked we're good we're clean and as an

971
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,980
assessor I think the saying is trust but

972
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,740
verify yeah yeah absolutely look and I

973
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:15,060
think

974
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:18,420
I think just in the in recognition of

975
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,160
time that we've got today we I think we

976
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,859
could carry on for many hours but

977
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:24,720
um I think what I want to leave the

978
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,599
audience with is the the

979
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,880
fact that the action plan is coming and

980
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,619
that we have an opportunity to try and

981
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:33,420
influence government

982
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:37,380
um in in how we secure data more

983
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,300
generally than than just Privacy

984
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,060
Information and I think that we start we

985
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:43,880
need to start the journey to understand

986
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,960
what data we have within our

987
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,520
organizations

988
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,380
um and leads that conversation into

989
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:53,400
what's the value of that data and help

990
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,200
them understand if if we get this wrong

991
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,079
if if the business doesn't con doesn't

992
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:00,359
secure it what's the implications for

993
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:01,680
them I think that's probably one of the

994
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,720
summarized points here is irrespective

995
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,940
of what does end up happening out in the

996
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,040
legislative frame landscape out there

997
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,960
irrespective of where the Privacy Act

998
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,820
ends up irrespective of what comes out

999
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:13,500
of this National Data security action

1000
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,020
plan it's definitely a strong signal

1001
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:18,240
that says that businesses are being

1002
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,280
asked to start to think more about the

1003
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,680
data rather than the cyber security

1004
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,800
aspect and the repositories and really

1005
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,540
start to understand the the individual

1006
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,760
records should you be holding them where

1007
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,579
are they what have you collected can you

1008
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:34,560
delete it you know the one of the best

1009
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,440
strategies is data minimization and you

1010
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,940
can't begin that process until you've

1011
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,099
actually understood where it all is

1012
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:43,260
um so just um being very brief on this

1013
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,359
particular topic we mentioned a manual

1014
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,339
approach before that's been the

1015
00:37:47,339 --> 00:37:49,200
traditional way but there are other ways

1016
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,060
and one of them is a systematic approach

1017
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:52,980
using data Discovery if you're

1018
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,119
interested in understanding more about

1019
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:56,040
how that would work and how it could get

1020
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,440
into Cloud into on-prem desktops email

1021
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,240
you name it and start to help an

1022
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,579
organization understand where data has

1023
00:38:02,579 --> 00:38:04,859
ended up you can go chat to my

1024
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:06,359
colleagues out on the floor at the

1025
00:38:06,359 --> 00:38:08,040
groundlab stand it's the dark navy blue

1026
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,040
stand towards the back and um and we can

1027
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,560
certainly let you know more about it and

1028
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,359
if you do work with any of these fine

1029
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,420
organizations up here in a security

1030
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:20,700
Consulting assistance manner including

1031
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,099
Sakura including Vector Corp including

1032
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:25,200

00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:32,220
always do then you can also talk to them

1037
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,720
about ground labs they all have

1038
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:34,800
excellent knowledge in our product

1039
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,780
they've been using it they've been using

1040
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,640
our products for typically 10 years in

1041
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,980
Australia so with that said I won't

1042
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,140
speak any more other than to say look I

1043
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:45,900
hope this was helpful thanks Chris for

1044
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,240
for joining me and

1045
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,040
um we'll say thank you very much for

1046
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:52,339
your time

1047
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,119
foreign

1048
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:55,740
thank you Stephen Chris quite an

1049
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,119
interesting discussion um there have

1050
00:38:57,119 --> 00:38:58,740
been a few questions but they all sent

1051
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,260
around basically the question I was kind

1052
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:04,380
of asking is how close will any of these

1053
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,880
upcoming changes to the Australian

1054
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,740
Privacy Act or the Privacy principles or

1055
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:08,760
any other

1056
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,579
aspects regulated and governed by the IC

1057
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:15,740
will that bring us to gdpr and

1058
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:19,079
realistically is there one of these

1059
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:21,000
standards gdpr for example that we

1060
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,859
should Target that will actually give us

1061
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:24,960
coverage across the board especially for

1062
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,119
an international organization or do we

1063
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:29,160
still need to synthesize our own common

1064
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,780
set of Baseline requirements that are

1065
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,880
actually above every single one I think

1066
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,380
every country wants its own sovereignty

1067
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,060
right so there's no way Australia is

1068
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:39,060
just going to say yep gdpr Waka Aussie

1069
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:42,140
government logo on it and off we go

1070
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:46,200
look my reading of the the feedback and

1071
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,339
the questions that have come up during

1072
00:39:47,339 --> 00:39:49,500
the consultative process on the Privacy

1073
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,640
Act review

1074
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,460
definitely is pointing towards how do we

1075
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,980
align Australia privacy with gdpr

1076
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,200
Australia can still have its own privacy

1077
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,180
Rigs and laws and ways of doing it but

1078
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,440
the key thing is to make sure that when

1079
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,780
we get into the the notification when we

1080
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,880
get into the definition of personal data

1081
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,339
when we get into the for example in gdpr

1082
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,260
you must appoint a data Protection

1083
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,119
Officer in the organization under

1084
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:13,859
Australian privacy you do not have to do

1085
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:16,079
that so just things like that is where

1086
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,540
we may see more alignment and and

1087
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:21,020
they're good things but at the same time

1088
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,579
organizations are struggling to comply

1089
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:26,460
with gdpr I mean it came out in May 2018

1090
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,440
I don't know what the latest stat is but

1091
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:31,500
it's low in terms of compliance and even

1092
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:34,020
the UK after brexit you know they've

1093
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,640
been looking at how can they maybe water

1094
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,640
down their alignment to gdpr just a

1095
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,859
little bit while staying adequate so

1096
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:42,300
there's a few interesting things that

1097
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,920
are being thought about there just to

1098
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,180
make it more achievable for average

1099
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,500
business when you're a large

1100
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,619
organization with budget resources time

1101
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:53,040
you obviously fully comply but an

1102
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,720
average organization really is

1103
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,720
struggling and you know I think there's

1104
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,599
got to be a happy medium but the reading

1105
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:02,700
of what I'm seeing is that it does seem

1106
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,520
like Australia would like to try and get

1107
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,839
aligned and possibly become adequate

1108
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,660
against the gdpr but it's not explicit

1109
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:11,220
at least from what I've read and I could

1110
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,780
be wrong here I haven't seen it

1111
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,880
explicitly stated that you know that is

1112
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,160
the goal of this review process but it

1113
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,780
is interesting that this review process

1114
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:22,859
started in 2019 12 18 months after gdpr

1115
00:41:22,859 --> 00:41:25,200
came out and they've just wrapped up the

1116
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,540
feedback process so from here we'll wait

1117
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,400
to see the cogs turn in the background

1118
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,560
and what starts coming out on on the

1119
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:35,099
front line thank you all again

1120
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:37,079
um we now have lunch and then at 1 15

1121
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:39,599
we'll resume the um broken out the split

1122
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:42,200
room sessions

1123
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,300
foreign
