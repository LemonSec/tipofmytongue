1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,000
all right excellent can we give a warm

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,440
round of applause for mr chris gatford

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,140
thank you

4
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:13,699
[Applause]

5
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,359
that was a saving grace uh not sure if i

6
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:18,880
was going to have to bring up any of my

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,199
jokes uh any further after that anyhow

8
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:23,519
look thanks very much uh it's actually

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,840
quite exciting this is despite coming to

10
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,240
ulcer for over

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,279
17 years and presenting for a fair few

12
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,239
of them i've never actually done a main

13
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,399
talk before i've always taken the

14
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,239
opportunity to do tutorials

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,719
so quite exciting uh

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:43,120
20 years in i.t security

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,800
and i guess i kind of call myself a

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,239
white hat hacker

19
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,800
these days i'm probably a little less

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,800
technical than i used to be back in the

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,160
day but

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,120
hacking is not about

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,760
actual technical skill hacking in my

24
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,239
opinion and and then and in some others

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,760
it is about the bending of things to

26
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,680
basically solve a problem it's out of

27
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,280
the box thinking

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,880
and i still kind of get to do that on a

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,680
regular basis which i quite enjoy

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,520
i also

31
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,680
like to bend the rules

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,720
because rules are there in our world in

33
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,200
the hacking culture to be bent

34
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,520
and i thought that was uh quite an apt

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,439
one there with lisa standing in front of

36
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,720
the science because we are faced with so

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,600
much security theater we

38
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,560
make

39
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,040
hackers look sound

40
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,360
so great and scary and clever

41
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,680
when in reality

42
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,759
uh you know it's much less

43
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,720
exotic than that

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,320
but i will say this though the mr robot

45
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,280
tv series what a great tv series

46
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,960
hands in the audience if you watch mr

47
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,079
robot

48
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,960
all right 30 i'm preaching to the choir

49
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,600
one of the great things about mr robot

50
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,920
by the way is that they actually had

51
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,959
somebody from industry and our culture

52
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,038
helping them make sure all those

53
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,360
techniques and tools were actually

54
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,680
technically accurate

55
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,360
and at some point there was ransomware

56
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,720
deployed at mr river on evil corp

57
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,800
the problem is

58
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,760
because we make it look so hard and

59
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,959
complex

60
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,800
the powers that be

61
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,599
who hand us down our budgets or give us

62
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,120
our resources or get tired of us

63
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,599
telling them we need more money or more

64
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,760
effort etc in our organizations and

65
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,720
certainly here in australia means really

66
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,160
we struggle

67
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,400
we struggle to do too much

68
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
we struggle to do too much with too

69
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,599
little

70
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,480
or we just give up because be quite

71
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,480
honest i'm a little irritated i am

72
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,680
copying and pasting the same findings

73
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,080
job after job

74
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,440
and largely

75
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,680
is because we are asleep

76
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,239
at the wheel

77
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,560
i wish it wasn't the case

78
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,959
i wish we could write some new novel

79
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,200
interesting findings

80
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,080
but

81
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,400
nonetheless it's interesting

82
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,560
we also

83
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,879
seem to really not think about the

84
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,959
messaging that we send out

85
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,280
we don't think about the impact

86
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,480
so

87
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,280
my talk today on ransomware

88
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,440
the technical debt collector kind of

89
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,280
circles back we're going to talk about a

90
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,720
few examples i'm going to talk about

91
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,040
some of the global stuff

92
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,080
but

93
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,680
as a you know self-confessed

94
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,239
uh geek

95
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,799
when you think about ransomware and the

96
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,040
fact that they take our digital assets

97
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,760
and then they sell them back to us

98
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,280
what

99
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,040
what can i use to signify

100
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,159
this actual task or this actual process

101
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,080
that uh ransomware collectors are doing

102
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,159
but still make it human like a bit of

103
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,680
humor in there so i can get management

104
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,239
to take a bit of attention right well i

105
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,200
bring you

106
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,920
the jawa

107
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,798
the actual perfect star wars analogy for

108
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,639
ransomware because these little guys

109
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:25,360
they run around they steal your stuff

110
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,639
and then they try and sell it back to

111
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,720
you and start was perfect so it's spot

112
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,639
the jawa game guys

113
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,720
now

114
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,479
this all started

115
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,360
for me

116
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,400
in

117
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,160
when covert hit

118
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,240
i could see that there was going to be

119
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,320
quite a lot of more malicious activity

120
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,919
uh coming up so i was thinking to myself

121
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,360
okay well what are we going to do about

122
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,440
this uh as a

123
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,639
as an organization how are we going to

124
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,520
help our client base

125
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,159
and i knew the problem

126
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,400
i knew the problem was going to be

127
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:04,240
basically two major things

128
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,160
users

129
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,000
because they don't listen

130
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,759
we tell them to

131
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,520
choose good quality passwords we tell

132
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,000
them to make sure that they're using mfa

133
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,520
on everything but unfortunately they

134
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,520
don't and we don't monitor for the gaps

135
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,600
i also knew the other problem the reason

136
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,960
why we don't monitor for the gaps is

137
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,759
because as i said before we're

138
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,800
under resourced and overutilized

139
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,160
and that's because we struggle

140
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,160
continuously

141
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,639
to get appropriate resourcing

142
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,440
gee

143
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,520
put your hand up if you've got more than

144
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,960
enough money for your i.t security

145
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,280
budget

146
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,720
i was just i just want to see who was

147
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,000
buying drinks tonight um

148
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,880
so um i thought uh a lot of people

149
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,080
probably were very familiar with um with

150
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,680
ransomware and i was surprised you know

151
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,479
i like as i've sort of crept slowly more

152
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,400
and more out of being in technical land

153
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,080
i thought you know like it was a pretty

154
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,160
common thing but even last night at a

155
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,280
function

156
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,280
um i was actually surprised that yeah

157
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,560
people didn't understand some of the key

158
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,319
concepts or some of the key things so

159
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,880
let me take everybody back to level one

160
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,800
on this this is not an overly technical

161
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,479
talk but it's a really good background i

162
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:21,600
thought

163
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,840
ransomware is easy

164
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,759
it is no different to previous

165
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,319
compromises and all the history of

166
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,560
various things in fact the history and

167
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,120
the origins of ransomware actually

168
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,240
started

169
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,759
interestingly at the same time that we

170
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,160
just heard brian haye was doing

171
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,080
tackling

172
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,240
guys streaking across the football field

173
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,880
1989

174
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,520
1989 was the first piece of ransomware

175
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,400
and

176
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,599
back in those days you didn't have

177
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,800
bitcoin so after you were infected you

178
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,599
had to send 189 to a po box in panama

179
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,680
and they would send you a floppy disk

180
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,840
with the decryption key

181
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,720
so

182
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,160
it's uh it's been around for quite a

183
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,080
while obviously

184
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,160
it massively increased when we

185
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,240
introduced bitcoin the ability to do a

186
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,039
lot of trading and get the information

187
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,120
get the send the funds globally and

188
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,120
everyone thinks it's untraceable bitcoin

189
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,680
is very traceable um sometimes there are

190
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,440
things that screw up the tracing process

191
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,000
like uh bitcoin tumblers

192
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,720
it's a whole other chat but

193
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,039
so it's very traceable still but it's

194
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,400
obviously been facilitated by bitcoin

195
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,479
and then we think about the origins and

196
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,960
like you know everyone thinks well you

197
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,880
know where where do all these ransomware

198
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,919
attacks go on there's all these

199
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,599
different group names and you know it's

200
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,840
breaking intelligence now we're pretty

201
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,960
confident they come from here

202
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:53,599
and in fact in recent times

203
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,599
80

204
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,520
of all of the known

205
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,599
traffic that's malicious in relation

206
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,680
to ransomware gangs

207
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,319
has been coming from russia

208
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,400
and a large portion also from ukraine

209
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,840
which is obviously a little bit

210
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,759
interrupted at the moment

211
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:15,360
they've stopped even trying to obfuscate

212
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,919
the originating ip addresses and dns

213
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,800
names

214
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,639
they really just don't care anymore

215
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:24,560
so when you start looking into the

216
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,639
statistics for this

217
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,319
it is incredibly scary

218
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,120
just in

219
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,320
2021 alone

220
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,440
1500 victims

221
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,000
give or take and i believe this is very

222
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,519
underreported

223
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,360
um and i'll show another slide in a

224
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,519
second where we looked into

225
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,320
one of the other groups

226
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,760
it's incredible

227
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,600
if you think about that let's just

228
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,279
assume conti there and lock lockbert

229
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,959
which are the two biggest ransomware

230
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,160
gangs that are currently operating at

231
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,120
the moment

232
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,880
if they were sort of averaging around

233
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,720
500

234
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,760
victims a year at an average and this is

235
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,560
a global amount of 100 000 us dollars

236
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,399
we're talking around 40 to 50 million

237
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,920
us dollars

238
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,800
per ransomware group there

239
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,359
per year

240
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:23,480
that's a lot of cyber insurance premiums

241
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,839
so

242
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:29,680
massive amounts of money under reported

243
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,600
and certainly some great headlines to

244
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,279
date

245
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,040
the method

246
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,360
that the ransomware gangs use is initial

247
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,959
access

248
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,800
then facilitation by the ransomware

249
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,680
group

250
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,720
and then

251
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,560
the double extortion method which is

252
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:47,040
then publishing and encrypting the

253
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,200
information as well

254
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,399
now in the um sort of experience

255
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,720
when we were talking to victims

256
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,160
they don't care

257
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,600
about the encrypted stuff because most

258
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,560
people

259
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,959
with reasonable

260
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,160
um i guess i t skill have good backups

261
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,560
they had good recovery processes they

262
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,680
absolutely care about the published data

263
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,240
that is what scares the bejesus out of

264
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,560
all management

265
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,880
actually zed scalar had a really good

266
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,640
image on this so i borrowed it from them

267
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,839
gave them props down the below there

268
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,839
on the very left hand side we see the

269
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,240
initial access and that is still coming

270
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,360
from the most common attack vectors

271
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,600
which we've technically had solutions

272
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,040
for for years maybe even decades in some

273
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,000
cases

274
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,880
so we have it coming in via spam

275
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,519
phishing brute forcing or stolen

276
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:42,880
credentials

277
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,600
specifically to rdp

278
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,839
yes shock horror

279
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,519
rdp still well and alive out there and

280
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,880
certainly in the australian internet

281
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,000
space

282
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,320
and then we've seen more recently than

283
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,320
picking up they

284
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,839
actually pick up new vulnerabilities

285
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:02,880
quicker

286
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,640
than internal i.t

287
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,160
and get out there and exploiting and

288
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,399
working out who the victims are

289
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,880
super quick at picking up a new exploit

290
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,240
weaponizing

291
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,680
and then using it to find victims

292
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,680
so that's the initial access now once

293
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,160
they're in the network they're going to

294
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,120
do

295
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,360
absolutely the same things that you know

296
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,040
other malicious people do and or you

297
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,160
know when you've got security

298
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,519
consultants or people performing

299
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,519
penetration testing as you do on a

300
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,519
six-month basis

301
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,279
not not

302
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,120
so when you're doing that when they're

303
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,880
doing that kind of activity

304
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,600
they're actually not generally quiet

305
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,959
because they're trying to do this

306
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,200
relatively quickly and get in get the

307
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,839
data they're after and out

308
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:46,880
so

309
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,200
it should show up now one of the groups

310
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,839
actually use a pen testing or a couple

311
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:52,959
of pen testing tools but one

312
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,320
specifically called bloodhound has

313
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,720
anyone ever seen bloodhound

314
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,639
cool a few hands bloodhound tells you

315
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,959
what credentials you have and if you

316
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,959
logged onto the system here and pulled

317
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,000
off

318
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,200
some of the hashes that are currently

319
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,600
resident in that workstation what access

320
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,200
you could achieve

321
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,680
it's like a map for being naughty in a

322
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,839
windows active and directory environment

323
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,200
super handy

324
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,880
so

325
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,160
they perform

326
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,760
their network reconnaissance and their

327
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,000
lateral movement detection they find the

328
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,040
data

329
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,560
that they want to take and they're

330
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,160
looking for sensitive stuff these guys

331
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,600
are quite clever

332
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,440
they're not messing around they're not

333
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,760
taking you know boring stuff they're

334
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,200
going after the board papers they're

335
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,959
going after the payroll they're going

336
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,480
after your supplier invoices

337
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,839
and then of course

338
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,000
then comes the encryption now at this

339
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,079
extortion tactic two point

340
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,519
this is when it starts hitting the fan

341
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,800
because that's generally when most

342
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,160
organizations notice they're getting

343
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,320
locked out of systems

344
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,000
data's already gone

345
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,920
that's game over when you start seeing

346
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,079
encrypted systems we know

347
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:58,880
that

348
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,079
uh it's it's too late and of course then

349
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,920
they move to doing other things like

350
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,760
threatening ddos

351
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,399
and then of course if you haven't or

352
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,920
decide not to

353
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,399
pay the ransom eventually

354
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,680
your data is leaked publicly

355
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,480
they put a sample up just enough to

356
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,560
pique your interest and get the media

357
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,160
attention as well because they want that

358
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,320
undue pressure on you

359
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,480
so this is the process that most of them

360
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,320
follow

361
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,000
here are a few examples

362
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,639
by the way my approach today was

363
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,320
if you're a client of ours or um

364
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,760
someone we've done work for we're kind

365
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,120
of bound by uh our

366
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,120
confidentiality clauses in our proposal

367
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,959
so i'm obviously not naming any of our

368
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,000
clients

369
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,040
however

370
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,040
all of this is publicly available

371
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,199
so my approach this is well i'm just

372
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,639
going to share the existing already

373
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,800
publicly available data unless it's a

374
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,720
client

375
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,160
so my conscious is clear

376
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,680
when you go

377
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,000
to a disclosure page

378
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,600
this is kind of what they look like

379
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,240
here's a couple here uh they're in sort

380
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,800
of talking about the actual organization

381
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,560
they tell you what their annual turnover

382
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,639
how many employees they've got the

383
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,959
actual sample or in this case the actual

384
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,279
full data link there and in fact

385
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,760
sometimes they password protect it

386
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,850
so it's less likely to be

387
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,519
[Music]

388
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,120
discovered

389
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,959
presumably by the file sharing space

390
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,839
solutions themselves

391
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,079
other times is a bit more basic

392
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,240
you know the more entry-level ransomware

393
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,480
groups mix it up with good old directory

394
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,720
browsing so now you can cherry pick your

395
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,920
data but also makes it very easy to also

396
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,680
scrape the entire site and pull down all

397
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,279
of the files themselves and as you can

398
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,120
see by the file names the directory

399
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,240
names here

400
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,399
again they've chosen some very

401
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,040
interesting folders

402
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,160
we've got

403
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,160
directors we've got department data

404
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,240
we've got accounts and yes i did gray

405
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,760
out some of these ones because i thought

406
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,240
it was uh um probably

407
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,760
prudent to not identify this

408
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,839
organization

409
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:10,000
um

410
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,920
and we just heard earlier who saw the

411
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,959
brett winterford talk

412
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,639
so much irony with brett giving me that

413
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,839
talk wasn't it

414
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,680
brett used to be an absolute cracker

415
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,959
reporter

416
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,800
reporting exactly on that kind of thing

417
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,320
now he's on the other side this girl was

418
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,800
good to see him squirm uh no he's a good

419
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,440
friend brett and i uh i was very

420
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,160
interesting talk but lapses which

421
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,079
attacked octa and we heard him talking

422
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,440
through

423
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,560
some of the things that they're doing

424
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,680
are also slightly different again

425
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,360
they are

426
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,720
using telegram as opposed to a a dark

427
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,320
website

428
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,920
so they're publishing the data quite

429
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,880
quickly

430
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,440
uh and and fast and look you know here's

431
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,279
a screenshot that i took

432
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,800
with the lg

433
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,639
domain hashes

434
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,240
the domain hashes

435
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,160
for all of lge

436
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,800
being dumped by the lapsis group

437
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,000
now from an incident response

438
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,199
perspective

439
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,360
if you've just lost your active

440
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,240
directory domain hashes

441
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,000
that's a real problem

442
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,880
like

443
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,000
like that's

444
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,680
that's like a month of work just to go

445
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,199
around and

446
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,800
end users are fine to change but all

447
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,360
those service accounts all the impact is

448
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,279
huge

449
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,920
uh and because lapses is also using

450
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,480
torrent files in that bottom screenshot

451
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,360
there

452
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,199
uh it means it's very hard to do a

453
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:32,800
takedown

454
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,440
there isn't a central point anymore

455
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,839
so as we see ransomware groups moving to

456
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,600
doing things like this it's going to

457
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,560
become

458
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,880
much more difficult

459
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,920
for organizations

460
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,639
by the way i've i've got i've got some

461
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,399
cracker jaw pictures

462
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,320
it's just they just keep they just keep

463
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,360
on giving

464
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,440
so the first group um that i'll walk you

465
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,279
through is conti

466
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,759
one of the most notorious groups

467
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:00,800
uh

468
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:04,559
around 808 to a thousand victims so far

469
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,439
um

470
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,959
the u.s state department had some good

471
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,119
information on this because let's face

472
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,319
it the us is the main target of all of

473
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,919
these ransomware groups

474
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:14,799
um

475
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,880
if we look at the numbers there

476
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,160
approximately 80 million to 150 million

477
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,240
dollars u.s that has been extracted by

478
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,000
this ransomware group these guys are

479
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,760
living large so it shouldn't be that

480
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,839
hard to spot them that's based on an

481
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,880
average again of 100 or 150k usd

482
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,679
per victim

483
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:34,880
there we are

484
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,760
1.9

485
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,679
but that 1.9 is still a massive impact

486
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,200
uh for the organizations that have been

487
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,360
affected

488
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,679
so the us got a little bit pissed off

489
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,480
with conte and they said okay

490
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,760
here's 15 million bucks as a reward for

491
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,840
the arrest of the conti ransomware group

492
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,200
members

493
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,400
uh now

494
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,960
most of these guys are in russia

495
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,240
or

496
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,400
uh georgia or

497
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,720
somewhere in ukraine so the likelihood

498
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,240
of actually ever getting these people

499
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,640
arrested is very low unless they're

500
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,640
stupid enough to travel which has

501
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,080
happened actually quite a few times

502
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,080
funnily enough so

503
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,280
who knows

504
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,600
recently they took down

505
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,120
the

506
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,960
couple of networks in costa rica they

507
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,520
declared a national emergency

508
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,760
from ransomware

509
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,799
when conte had a little bit of an

510
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,799
internal political problem

511
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:33,760
um

512
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,120
like a you know an unhappy employee

513
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:37,919
he

514
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,640
threw his toys and then did some doxing

515
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,960
of their methods and their tools and

516
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,799
leaked them online and then because of

517
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,720
the conflict at the moment people picked

518
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,480
up those tools and some of the things

519
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,640
and then started targeting russia uh

520
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,760
organizations with the actual tools as

521
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,000
retaliation it's kind of that's kind of

522
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,760
funny

523
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,520
um here's the conte news page you've

524
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,200
probably seen some screenshots of this

525
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,240
in the past at the time that i took this

526
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,760
um

527
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,360
uh we can see there was three victims

528
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,120
there finite recruitment have been in

529
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,400
the media

530
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,160
talking about their ransomware incident

531
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,360
if you think about it though if you're

532
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,640
going to ransomware and you're going to

533
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,919
take files

534
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,039
taking a recruitment company or lawyers

535
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,960
or medical data

536
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,679
has massive impact like think of all

537
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,280
those resumes

538
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,080
that just got scooped up by the like

539
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,840
it's full of useful pii of course and uh

540
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,320
helps you create a profile

541
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,320
so this is continues page when you go to

542
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,720
a dark website obviously people like to

543
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,080
make it sound

544
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,400
mysterious with the dot onion you can

545
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,720
just download the tor browser

546
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,120
or a little little side hack there are a

547
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,919
couple of clear text clear web to dark

548
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,360
web

549
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,679
redirection services so if you throw a

550
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,280
ws or a dot w y on the end of a dot

551
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,120
onion address you'll be able to see it

552
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,880
in a standard browser

553
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,120
it doesn't stop you from any malware but

554
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,679
you can still get there

555
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,159
conti also had a really interesting one

556
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,400
and that they decided to uh

557
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,360
um

558
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,080
uh

559
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,640
list as a victim graph diamonds i'm not

560
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,720
sure if i'm pronouncing that right graph

561
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,760
graph

562
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,320
anyway that really luxurious diamond

563
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,360
brand

564
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,559
that none of us have probably ever

565
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,320
bought from in this room here

566
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,480
um the problem is

567
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,400
they didn't actually look at the sample

568
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,120
data that they put up about

569
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,120
um or the ransomware group didn't look

570
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,120
at the the data they actually put up and

571
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,120
when they put the data up

572
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,280
unfortunately

573
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,559
it had a lot of saudi royal family

574
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,520
members buying jewelry

575
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,400
not necessarily for their wives and

576
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,320
girlfriends

577
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,039
so it got a little bit embarrassing the

578
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,559
ransomware group got a little bit

579
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,039
worried about losing arms hands legs

580
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,320
so they actually apologized

581
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,640
it's like a soap opera online they

582
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,679
actually apologized on their website uh

583
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,440
and said look sorry for causing any

584
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,080
inconvenience

585
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:19,280
um so what do we got oh yes all right um

586
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,360
yeah so the the guy that uh was a little

587
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,960
bit disgruntled he actually leaked it

588
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,240
some researchers did some really cool

589
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,760
stuff on this uh this came from

590
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,039
checkpoint and they could work out their

591
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,919
organizational charts

592
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,600
um because they're quite organized so

593
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,120
you know we've got the the red team up

594
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,320
there in the research development the

595
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,919
developers the reverse engineers and the

596
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,760
third party service operators down below

597
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,000
you've got recruitment you know those

598
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,720
fun guys in hr

599
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,200
the affiliates so the way that a lot of

600
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,760
this works is that these guys are

601
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,799
basically

602
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:53,520
hiring people to get the initial access

603
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,080
or buying the initial access

604
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,039
and of course you've got business

605
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,880
development top right hand corner there

606
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,720
and then finance you know finance i love

607
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,880
this finance dash money laundering so

608
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,640
it's important

609
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,360
so yeah they're very organized uh much

610
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,679
more than we would actually think

611
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,080
lockpit

612
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,120
12

613
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,320
000

614
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,480
victims slash

615
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,240
self-reported

616
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,679
um

617
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,200
this is funny because everyone assumed

618
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,640
they're around a thousand and they're

619
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,960
like no we're a better ransomware group

620
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,880
than those conti guys look

621
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,159
um and so based on their 12 000 victims

622
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,880
the way they self-disclosed this though

623
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,120
was actually taking a screenshot

624
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,679
of their own php back end and going look

625
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,080
in our victims

626
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,600
slash builds table we've got 12 000 rows

627
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,559
so we've got far more victims than conti

628
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,440
which is yeah kind of funny if you were

629
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,520
making over a billion dollars in

630
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,760
ransomware surely you'd be in the cloud

631
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,640
with a microsoft.net uh instance

632
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,600
not not running php

633
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,000
um so look have been a bit more active

634
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,919
certainly here in australia as we can

635
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:13,679
see the u.s not as much as um as conti

636
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,400
but 2.3 in australia

637
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,960
this is what their leak page looks like

638
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,000
um

639
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,480
they have a really irritating

640
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,520
file download view um i think i've got

641
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,720
that later on

642
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,400
um lapses all right

643
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,520
just drilling in we've already talked

644
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,039
about them a little bit by the way that

645
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,840
jawa picture down there

646
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,280
that was actually quite a good costume

647
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,120
out of all the costume ones i saw it was

648
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,320
a good one

649
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,200
lapses are around 10 or so victims at

650
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,799
this stage

651
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,159
it's hard to tell they're a bit

652
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,039
obviously new uh one of the guys

653
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,640
obviously got arrested also recently

654
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,760
everything i've got slide on there but

655
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,440
the other victims outside of october

656
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,679
ubisoft samsung microsoft and of course

657
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:56,240
more recently the brazilian

658
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,360
uh

659
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,120
various governments that also been hit

660
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,080
by

661
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,279
government departments been hit in

662
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,279
brazil

663
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:07,760
what is interesting about lapses mostly

664
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,799
is there less trying to get affiliates

665
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:13,120
they're more trying to get

666
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,640
the insider

667
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,520
they want to buy their access they want

668
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,760
someone to install

669
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:23,360
or give them vpn credentials

670
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,200
this really spins it a little bit right

671
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,200
so if you think about it inside most

672
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,039
organizations there's going to be you

673
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,760
know disgruntled malicious

674
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,760
employees somewhere

675
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,600
and when this becomes more widespread

676
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,120
and i see this probably the path of

677
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,279
where it's going to go in the future

678
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,440
we're kind of stuck

679
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,200
because it's very hard to defend against

680
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,720
a malicious insider that already has

681
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,720
access

682
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,240
they advertise their jobs on that

683
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,760
twitter handle down there it could be a

684
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,520
telegram handle

685
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,880
but lapses

686
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,880
jobs

687
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,720
so it's interesting um

688
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,320
and these are all trivial things to

689
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,919
actually look for if you're running good

690
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,679
infosec solutions for unusual behavior

691
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,840
for example if originating ip addresses

692
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,600
for the vpn are coming out from an

693
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,080
unusual location that should be a flag

694
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,760
right and that other behavior should

695
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,760
then generate an alert so all these

696
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,080
things are overcomeable

697
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,640
but we're not used to it

698
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,880
and because they got one oxford

699
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,440
teenager who i doubt

700
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,760
is uh had that significant role to be

701
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,360
honest but um

702
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,200
uh arrests really aren't going to make

703
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,720
any difference people making good money

704
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,400
out of this

705
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,799
uh that was a one on lg hashes okay

706
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,679
global examples

707
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,559
accenture

708
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,440
checking time um

709
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,200
accenture in august 2021 had a

710
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,799
compromise everyone was really

711
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:56,080
interested to see this because they are

712
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,080
obviously a global security consultancy

713
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,440
i mean consultancy with some security uh

714
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,559
occasionally

715
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,080
they

716
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,840
were on the front page of lock bit for a

717
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,240
while they said no no

718
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,919
they don't have our data and they go yes

719
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,320
we do

720
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,520
um

721
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,600
and they had had to backtrack about two

722
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,279
months after they came out and said yep

723
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,520
no no like they didn't get anything they

724
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,600
went okay yeah they got something

725
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,360
because shortly after this compromise

726
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,760
these customers who ran accenture

727
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,480
airport software also got done by the

728
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,960
same ransomware group

729
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,159
wasn't a coincidence

730
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,919
yeah so they eventually had to admit the

731
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,760
data breach

732
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,360
if there was one thing i could iterate

733
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,240
and this is not because i'm trying to

734
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,799
promote a talk i'm in tomorrow but get

735
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,919
your media stuff sorted never let your

736
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,400
media and marketing guys respond without

737
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,559
getting cleared by the i.t and technical

738
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,240
department

739
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,760
because

740
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,520
we it just gets

741
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,919
absolutely smashed by analysts when it

742
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:02,080
hits the uh when it hits the media by

743
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,200
you know people that want to tear it

744
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,360
apart

745
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,320
colonial now this really changed a lot

746
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,640
of things in ransomware land but not so

747
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,720
much for us here in australia

748
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,960
when the colonial pipeline

749
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,159
effectively was shut down

750
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:18,840
for

751
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,240
weeks because of ransomware

752
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,840
funnily enough i think we were oscar at

753
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,840
the time it was happening was it shortly

754
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,039
after

755
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,640
um

756
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,840
it was a really

757
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,919
such a significant event and in the us

758
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,320
they have moved heaven and earth the

759
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,360
resources in the us for um

760
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,000
people suffering from from ransomware

761
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,360
are really extensive now it's really

762
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,080
good to see it caused massive mayhem we

763
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,360
had news all over the place about that

764
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,399
this caused real disruption

765
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,120
real disruption

766
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,640
i actually even heard unfortunately

767
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,520
somebody

768
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,919
dying because they filled up a plastic

769
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:02,320
bag with petrol and left it in their car

770
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,360
and then it caught on fire

771
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,520
and they were driving along caught on

772
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,880
fire and then they perished

773
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,600
this is dark side this is their job

774
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,960
advert

775
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,600
this was posted to one of the

776
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,159
cyber gang sites

777
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:21,760
where they were trying to recruit what i

778
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,360
wanted to draw attention to this is you

779
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,120
know they're not messing around i wish i

780
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,120
could put job ads out like this you know

781
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,000
they're talking about the technical

782
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,240
stuff that they want

783
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,760
but we don't want

784
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,279
someone who doesn't follow the rules so

785
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,559
look we're not going after funeral

786
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,600
services

787
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,880
public sector

788
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,399
uh non-profit

789
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,720
and healthcare please

790
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,399
of course they don't always follow those

791
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,919
rules particularly well because they

792
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,279
often don't actually understand what

793
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,360
they're targeting

794
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,279
um

795
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:50,960
can you join us yes there's the

796
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,399
interview process

797
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:52,900
um

798
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,360
[Music]

799
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,200
they they did actually want i think it's

800
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,720
somewhere in here i'm not sure why i

801
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,159
actually showed it but they wanted

802
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,840
examples of the previous places you'd

803
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,000
ransomware for other affiliate groups to

804
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,960
uh to to help speed up the process

805
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,159
um graham clearly what a great headline

806
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,720
so after darkseid

807
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,600
had done the colonial pipeline

808
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,799
they

809
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,880
as graham suggested would be

810
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,000
themselves

811
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,840
because everyone in the world would have

812
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:22,960
been looking for them there would have

813
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,039
been massive amounts biden poured a ton

814
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,200
of money into it and they became you

815
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:27,919
know

816
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,000
public enemy number one

817
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,240
so that was uh also a little a little

818
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,720
humorous insight into them um

819
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:39,120
they did pay 5 million bucks in ransom

820
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,960
to dark side

821
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,120
and then dark side pretty much disbanded

822
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,120
so that one was really pivotal because

823
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,399
it's changed a lot which is going to

824
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:49,919
flow on to us here in the us and

825
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:51,679
hopefully the australian government will

826
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,720
pick up some of the initiatives

827
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,720
because if we don't we're going to end

828
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,520
up like uh this poor person was in

829
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,559
germany

830
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:03,520
uh the hospital was so disrupted by

831
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,760
ransomware on their systems somebody who

832
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,159
was on their way or was critically ill

833
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,799
had to be redirected to another hospital

834
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,360
and unfortunately she died on the way

835
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,760
because she didn't it was a much longer

836
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,000
trip

837
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,120
people keep paying the ransom of course

838
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,640
this was a large insurance firm

839
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,799
ironically that also issues cyber

840
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,880
insurance

841
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,120
they

842
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,120
they paid 40 million dollars every time

843
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,440
we pay the fines we're just encouraging

844
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,919
the business model

845
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,840
so i was like okay what am i going to do

846
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,279
when covert hit

847
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,799
around ransomware and i was like okay

848
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,080
i'm going to start seeing if i can

849
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,279
monitor

850
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,360
all the victims in australia

851
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,559
and then

852
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,559
because one of our clients got got done

853
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,320
by at the time and i was like okay well

854
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,679
they didn't really know what to do have

855
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,279
anybody to talk to etc you try and ring

856
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,519
any of the reporting lines in australia

857
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,799
and to be honest they're pretty

858
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,320
ineffective

859
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,240
and not not actually really actually

860
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,640
giving any proper advice in my opinion

861
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,799
um so this was me

862
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,720
uh i was like this is gonna be okay

863
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,679
i don't really know what i'm doing but

864
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:13,679
i'll give it a crack um you know flex

865
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,840
the old technical muscles again

866
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,760
because i thought everybody like this

867
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,200
would be sorted right like i just

868
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,799
thought you know

869
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,880
everybody have access to resources to do

870
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,480
this kind of stuff you know like you

871
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,679
know when

872
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:26,559
like

873
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:29,279
governments can help no

874
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,640
no they can't so all right and no one

875
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,919
was doing this all right well how hard

876
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,600
is it okay so we need to start

877
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,679
monitoring various internet channels so

878
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:36,799
i kind of

879
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:38,720
did the research

880
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,880
some great resources out there worked

881
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,720
out how to monitor the various groups

882
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,320
where to get the source list from how to

883
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,240
join some of the chat sessions and i

884
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,480
came up with 66 ransomware groups to

885
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,200
keep

886
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,679
tabs on out of the 66

887
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,760
ransomware groups every time there was

888
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,679
an australian victim

889
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,559
i would do my best to ring them

890
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,559
as they came up on the sharing science i

891
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,320
would ring them and offer

892
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,360
complementary help and assistance

893
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,679
because we didn't want to profiteer out

894
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,679
of other people's misery at a time

895
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,760
that's so important

896
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,640
so i rang them up and i would speak to

897
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,480
whoever the seniors person i could find

898
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,559
on linkedin using a couple of plugins on

899
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,159
linkedin you get their direct dial

900
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,960
details that's another story and then

901
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,600
you ring them and you go look you know

902
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,880
can we help

903
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,480
and you can imagine

904
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,840
some

905
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,960
are receptive others are not

906
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,880
never try to ring a senior lawyer of a

907
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,480
lawyer company that's currently you know

908
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,960
got all the systems down it wasn't the

909
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,919
best response i got back i have to say i

910
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:44,559
think he mentioned something about suing

911
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,840
several times

912
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,080
103 victims in australia

913
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,480
since the start of 2020 to

914
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,559
i think about a few weeks ago when i

915
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,720
last updated this statistic a hundred

916
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,480
and three

917
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,039
um the ransomware groups

918
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,840
the big ones lock bit and conti 16 and

919
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,120
15

920
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,559
respectively

921
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:09,120
in australia

922
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,120
i actually was really surprised at some

923
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,760
of the breakdown of this we've got legal

924
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,080
construction and health now they already

925
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,600
said they're not targeting health a lot

926
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,960
of them but they don't really care they

927
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:21,840
say that but they do

928
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,600
new south wales labor was one that

929
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,039
caught my attention

930
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:26,880
yeah

931
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,120
so the labour party in new south wales

932
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,559
got compromised

933
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,640
uh they were done by the avedon group

934
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,480
they have since closed down

935
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,519
um

936
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,279
what was interesting is they went off

937
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,919
the list very quickly

938
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,760
like very quickly like they were there

939
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,519
for less than 12 hours they were saying

940
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,320
to me

941
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,559
did they pay the ransom do they have a

942
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,240
whip around the new south wales labor

943
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,080
political party and to actually pay the

944
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,159
ransom but it turned out later on that

945
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,600
they just realized oh no this political

946
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,960
company they might get us a bit too much

947
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,960
heat and they just dropped it

948
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,799
but all the data was still

949
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,440
up there and online in fact it's still

950
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,960
circulating around some of the trading

951
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,720
forums

952
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,200
this caused acsc to do an alert so they

953
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,800
published this little alert out and said

954
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,560
be on the lookout

955
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,040
uh for

956
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,760
an embedded public key to perform aes

957
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:19,119
256 encryption on all file data and keep

958
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,079
an eye out for windows schedule tasks to

959
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,719
establish persistence

960
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,639
that's not helpful

961
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,359
like we need more direct actions we need

962
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,359
hey go and look at these things it

963
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:32,879
exists

964
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,480
it's all there

965
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,079
macquarie health corporation another

966
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,399
very public one uh this is still up on

967
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,040
the site they haven't disclosed the data

968
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,719
but just in case you're wondering this

969
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:45,918
will change the face of australian data

970
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,918
privacy laws when this does eventually

971
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:49,960
drop

972
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,639
225 gigabytes of files

973
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,320
67 of those

974
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,079
gigabytes of those files or 62 gigabytes

975
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,560
of those files sorry is actually patient

976
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,560
data

977
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,320
that's going to hit at some point and

978
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,920
that's going to have a massive impact

979
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,760
maybe less of an impact but still be

980
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,839
very topical in the media we're all

981
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:14,160
sitting here watching this one

982
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,000
jetstar was compromised by the quantum

983
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,920
group they've taken 40 gig of data

984
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,160
quantum group haven't released it yet

985
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:24,240
um but we're all still waiting for it

986
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,680
last couple of things um transport

987
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,000
company in australia we rang them they

988
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,760
got done by phishing managed to help

989
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,440
them out uh that was good a

990
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,520
manufacturing company

991
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,400
and what we noticed about this

992
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,720
manufacturing company other people

993
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,720
around the world who are all

994
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,599
actually in the same industry very

995
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:44,400
specific

996
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,200
had also been recently named as victims

997
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,280
and we worked out the common denominator

998
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,280
by actually talking to the other victims

999
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,400
as well the international was one vendor

1000
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,480
this one vendor had had their help desk

1001
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,200
compromised and they were using

1002
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,119
some awful remote desktop solution and

1003
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:03,200
just remoting into the

1004
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,960
those guys clients and then just ransom

1005
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,280
wearing those guys

1006
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,560
and just encrypting all their data it

1007
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,800
was really interesting retail egregor

1008
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,800
that was just an rdp being exposed to

1009
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:13,920
the internet

1010
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:17,119
finance group by conte that was actually

1011
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,920
malware so it was an

1012
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,359
attachment to an email that particular

1013
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:24,640
one a rental business uh in australia

1014
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,760
that was when the exchange

1015
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,280
vulnerabilities came out so we were

1016
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,280
really smashed by those exchange runners

1017
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,880
in australia and the ransomware groups

1018
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,240
took good advantage of that and more

1019
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,839
malware for an architect firm that we

1020
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,880
also walked with

1021
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,640
but you know all of this is just

1022
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,119
generating more insurance talk but we've

1023
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,960
started seeing pushback this article

1024
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,720
actually suggests there is now pushback

1025
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,280
by the collective sizos

1026
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,880
uh in australia saying yeah it's a bit

1027
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,040
of a waste of time now because there are

1028
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,400
so many exclusions that they're not

1029
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,320
going to pay for so this is when we go

1030
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,040
well

1031
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:57,040
excuse me management guys

1032
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,040
let's not renew our cyber insurance

1033
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,200
let's put it into it let's put it into

1034
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,640
i.t security and get some more resources

1035
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,200
and more people

1036
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,320
possible solutions

1037
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,520
and the reason why i've got this jawwa

1038
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,040
picture is because these solutions have

1039
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,680
been as round as as long as

1040
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,160
she has

1041
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,599
it's not hard and if we don't do them we

1042
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,480
won't arrest people like this guy

1043
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,040
the american

1044
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,640
sizer.gov site has some excellent

1045
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,280
ransomware resources

1046
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,760
it all bends comes back to stopping

1047
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,720
fishing

1048
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,560
stopping internet facing vulnerabilities

1049
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,280
and misconfigurations not letting that

1050
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,520
malware in there in the first place and

1051
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,839
making sure we as we heard with octa

1052
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:44,800
heard

1053
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,320
manage our third parties and our managed

1054
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,480
service providers

1055
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,119
and of course hardening our environments

1056
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,880
i wish i could say something different

1057
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,880
that's wow and flashy about how we can

1058
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,240
stop this

1059
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,280
but it's not rocket science we just have

1060
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,599
to do our bread and butter things more

1061
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,160
frequently and better so people don't

1062
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,119
die

1063
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,240
and we don't bring down organizations

1064
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,090
thank you

1065
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:15,680
[Applause]

1066
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,960
thank you chris

1067
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,280
uh looking at the questions there aren't

1068
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,359
any related to the talk just a just some

1069
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,200
issues again with the stream any

1070
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,880
questions around the room have a few

1071
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,480
minutes

1072
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:31,079
oh there's a one over here

1073
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,960
thanks mate hi chris um

1074
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,520
i'd like to ask you about um obviously a

1075
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:43,119
lot of us know what has to be done uh

1076
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:45,599
in theory to uh to manage their

1077
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,000
vulnerabilities lead to ransomware

1078
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,280
um one of the barriers i've found um

1079
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,200
moving from larger to smaller

1080
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:57,359
organizations is the ubiquitous msp

1081
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:00,880
and um and having to deal with a set of

1082
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,160
conflicting

1083
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:03,520
priorities

1084
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,680
um and also the

1085
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,680
unfortunately ubiquitous remote

1086
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:10,400
monitoring management rmm software uh

1087
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,800
which i think you alluded to as uh

1088
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,640
having their uh their clients hit

1089
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,079
do you see

1090
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:22,000
that type of software um as being a a

1091
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,480
future vector for that

1092
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,000
um and how would you also

1093
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,920
think we could better approach managing

1094
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,680
msps

1095
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,320
and their need for access along with

1096
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:37,040
their potentially limited uh technical

1097
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:37,970
ability

1098
00:39:37,970 --> 00:39:40,640
[Music]

1099
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,839
that's a good question

1100
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,520
so we've already seen instances of msps

1101
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,839
being the the root of the compromise i

1102
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,359
talked about one briefly that we saw

1103
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:52,560
there was related to a particular

1104
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,400
industry

1105
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,200
we've just got to keep them honest uh

1106
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,160
you know

1107
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,359
i'm trying to remember which u.s

1108
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,359
official said this you know trust but

1109
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:04,480
verify

1110
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,560
uh as we also now see

1111
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,720
with with octa um from brett this

1112
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:09,599
morning

1113
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,040
um

1114
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,560
i think it's i

1115
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,079
you've just got to be more active

1116
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,839
managing those third parties i see it

1117
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,440
all the time and i'm also on the other

1118
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,280
side right i'm the one doing the

1119
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,520
security testing producing the

1120
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,280
compliance report the pentest report

1121
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,720
saying yep this you know we tested it on

1122
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,200
this day and here are the risks

1123
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,480
uh

1124
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,000
and a lot of organizations just take

1125
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,520
that go okay thanks we'll trust you

1126
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,880
cheers but you've got to do your own

1127
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,960
testing you know you can't take them

1128
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,319
verbatim you've got to surprise them

1129
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:39,359
with tests you've got to put security

1130
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:41,520
um

1131
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:43,760
penalties you're going to have penalties

1132
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,599
in your contract right so you can hurt

1133
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,200
them at the dollar point if they're not

1134
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,640
doing their job properly i think that's

1135
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,879
a good start

1136
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,319
session

1137
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,400
uh i wanted to understand from your

1138
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,520
experience if you have seen any changes

1139
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,960
in

1140
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,640
ransomware's

1141
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,599
organizations moving on to the cloud

1142
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,240
does it make them less

1143
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,440
kind of uh

1144
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,280
i mean would it make them more secure

1145
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,240
against intact okay good question so for

1146
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:22,240
those who didn't hear that um

1147
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,319
is moving to the cloud making you less

1148
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:26,560
susceptible to ransomware

1149
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:27,760
no

1150
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:29,760
and the reason being is your end user

1151
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,599
still needs to access the data it's

1152
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:33,040
often your end user that's getting

1153
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,880
compromised and then the data that they

1154
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,800
had access to being siphoned out and

1155
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,680
used as part of the ransomware process

1156
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,079
so no unfortunately

1157
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:44,160
if you can get rid of your users you

1158
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,839
might have a chance

1159
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:50,240
but i think i think we might need them

1160
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,079
uh with any other questions in the in

1161
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,160
the room

1162
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,359
just wondering if you're open to

1163
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:06,720
collaboration with your ransomware

1164
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,599
australia tracking project um you know

1165
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,760
working with other companies that can

1166
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,079
add to that for you

1167
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:14,880
sure

1168
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,400
let's uh always happy to have a

1169
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,680
conversation

1170
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,880
awesome

1171
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,319
all right look guys thanks very much for

1172
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:21,599
your time if you need to ask me any

1173
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,440
questions walking around just hit me up

1174
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,800
it'd be

1175
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,220
be happy to answer anything else cheers

1176
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:31,680
