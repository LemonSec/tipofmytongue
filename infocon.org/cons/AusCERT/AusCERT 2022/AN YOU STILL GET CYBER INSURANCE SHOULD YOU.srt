and david ruddick

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,360
can you still get cyber insurance should

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,480
you

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,000
what do you need to know about the

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:14,960
market

9
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,840

all right so can we have a warm round of

28
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,239
applause for benjamin and david thank

29
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,399
you

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,560
there goes our intro

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,479
thank you very much for those uh kind

32
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,320
words and thank you everyone for uh

33
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,159
coming to this session we appreciate

34
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,240
that when you get to hear about the fbi

35
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,680
and uh the nca there's a bit of

36
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,840
competition for attention but uh we'll

37
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,280
try and keep you interested and engaged

38
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,280
while we go through uh the

39
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,920
rim ads of cyber insurance

40
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,400
so in terms of our presentation today

41
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,759
you've got some quick intros from the

42
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:32,720
two of us

43
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,320
what we're going to be looking to cover

44
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,159
is a little bit about what's going on

45
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,920
with cyber insurance at the moment why

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,439
is there's a lot of negative publicity

47
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,280
negative headlines what's driving the

48
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,200
insurers what's driving the market

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,479
we also want to talk about some of the

50
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,840
key challenges just in terms of the

51
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,320
current risk in the exposure landscape

52
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,520
following on from there we're going to

53
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,360
give some strategic advice about where

54
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,040
cyber insurance is appropriate where is

55
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,560
isn't how do you think about cost

56
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,799
benefit and those types of tensions

57
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,159
and then we've got a couple of different

58
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,520
statistics and case studies just to

59
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,360
share with you on the current state uh

60
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,119
and also some questions

61
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,119
so with that in mind i think we'll dive

62
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,479
in and you can cover the first slide

63
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,800
david yes cool so why are we talking

64
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,399
about cyber insurance in fact uh in the

65
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,319
last couple of days since i've been here

66
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,920
doing tutorials there's been a number of

67
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,360
organic conversations that have talked

68
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,760
about the fact that oh my god my cyber

69
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,959
insurance premium has raised infinitely

70
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,040
and people are getting quite cautious

71
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,680
about this i i don't have to go through

72
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,680
all of these little excerpts to give you

73
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,920
some of the reasoning behind that

74
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,200
um

75
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,200
but there is still a value in cyber

76
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,599
insurance

77
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,840
so moving on everyone will get the

78
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,599
slides this is quite a content heavy

79
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,959
presentation so we're going to cover

80
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,040
these points relatively high level i

81
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,319
always get a lot of questions about what

82
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,080
does the insurance actually do how does

83
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,760
it fit into a program what does it mean

84
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,920
to civil liability or property and what

85
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,599
i say to people is there are three main

86
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,280
issues that you will be relying on cyber

87
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,640
insurance for

88
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,160
the first one sits under what we call a

89
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,319
first party cover first party means your

90
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,760
own loss so what we need to do to make

91
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,599
you whole and in there you'll see we

92
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,599
talk about breach restaurants costs so

93
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:04,800
the reality of a modern breach is

94
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,000
there's a bunch of work streams you've

95
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,519
got to manage there's a series of costs

96
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,800
there's a series of vendors that you

97
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,720
bring in typically it's lawyers it's

98
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,360
forensics it's crisis comms sometimes we

99
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,040
look at specific bits of cyber security

100
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,480
expertise depending on the nature of the

101
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,239
attacker and what you're dealing with

102
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,920
the insurance essentially has embedded a

103
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,760
breach response cover you can call a

104
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,120
hotline you're connected to these

105
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,560
vendors and the insurer will pay the

106
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,400
vendors costs once we've eroded your

107
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,920
deductible

108
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,200
as well as that we've got some other

109
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,799
covers for your direct losses so there's

110
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,799
a strong bi cover that we see a lot of

111
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,400
clients rely on now we'll talk a bit

112
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,720
about that later data restoration cost

113
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,480
is a huge issue at the moment

114
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,319
the historic view is particularly if we

115
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,400
were cloud-based we could tend to pull

116
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,239
everything out spin things back up again

117
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,440
and we'd be back to normal in a couple

118
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,760
of days doesn't work anymore attackers

119
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,360
are much better at knocking out cloud

120
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,200
capabilities we're also seeing a lot of

121
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,120
tensions around backups so often there's

122
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,360
a combination of manual recreation we

123
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,120
also see with the on-prem the costs and

124
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,959
the expenses can be really significant

125
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,000
particularly if there's a legacy

126
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,360
component to it

127
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,640
again i won't go through all of these

128
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,000
but i do want to also mention on the

129
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,560
third party we see a lot more litigation

130
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,159
risks and a lot of claims that follow

131
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,560
from a cyber event privacy regulation is

132
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,319
probably the most common we had the

133
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,519
comment before around the fact that

134
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,920
privacy is a global series of laws you

135
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,600
even see relatively small size

136
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,440
australian organizations having to worry

137
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,160
about global compliance so gdpr is based

138
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,759
on the data subjects you collect data

139
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,840
for same with the us laws same with the

140
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,000
asian laws that are emerging so privacy

141
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,840
costs and the privacy regulatory expense

142
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,080
has grown a lot i'll also talk a little

143
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,440
bit about some of the network security

144
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,919
liabilities this was historically a u.s

145
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,280
problem so what would happen was if a

146
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,800
virus went from your environment or a

147
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,639
piece of malware to a client

148
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,880
that could be the basis for a litigation

149
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,400
it's a tough one to cover because it

150
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,520
doesn't have to be a breach of a

151
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,360
professional service it could just be an

152
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,880
administrative failure it could just be

153
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,280
some part of the basic backbone of what

154
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,360
the organization is doing it can be hard

155
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,199
to cover with other policies and if we

156
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,639
want to cover that risk we've got to do

157
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,639
it through a cyber liability policy

158
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,720
again that's it is a bit of a nutshell

159
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,560
very very quickly i always get asked by

160
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,400
clients if i think about my losses and

161
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,400
my expenses and the key things that are

162
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
going to impact me what is the policy

163
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,479
covering we kind of use this wheel

164
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,160
because we think that the two biggest

165
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,680
issues for australian organizations at

166
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,520
the moment are financial business

167
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,520
interruption from a cyber event and the

168
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,199
cyber liability policy is specifically

169
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,639
designed to get that

170
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,560
as well as that the cost from cyber

171
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,000
extortion and ransomware have just

172
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,240
skyrocketed and the cyber policy is the

173
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,600
only one that's going to pick that up

174
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,520
within your own insurance program

175
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,600
i'll cover just a couple of these data

176
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,360
exfiltration and publication have a lot

177
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
of additional losses that sit around it

178
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,960
if it's x filled we've got a privacy

179
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,080
issue we've got a lot of different

180
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,080
stakeholder issues we see a lot more

181
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,840
risks around contractual liability where

182
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,000
we have exfil now so the covers for that

183
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,280
are historically going to live within

184
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,199
the cyber liability policy

185
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,360
the other two i'll quickly mention here

186
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,479
is some of the issues around

187
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,800
reputational harm we don't tend to see

188
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,639
as much customer churn in this region as

189
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,560
you do in the us but we often see as

190
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,680
there's a lot of additional work and

191
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,199
support you want to give key clients and

192
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,479
stakeholders to make sure that they

193
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,560
don't leave that is a mitigation cost

194
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,960
and also in terms of bi costs can be

195
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,880
covered within the cyber wording

196
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,639
last one that i'll just mention here is

197
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,560
people often talk about funds transfer

198
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,080
payment frauds the type of social

199
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,600
engineering attacks

200
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,280
cyber policies don't cover that some

201
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,360
crime do but we do find that the cyber

202
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,800
policy is still very useful because

203
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,919
where you have that there's someone

204
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,080
malicious in the it environment we need

205
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,520
to investigate it we need to understand

206
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,680
what's going on and those investigation

207
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,919
costs doing the root cause analysis it's

208
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:29,440
the cyber policy that's capable of

209
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,960
picking it up so that's a bit of a

210
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,800
nutshell of how most organizations tend

211
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,680
to touch or rely on the wording

212
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,759
i'll cover this one quickly as well but

213
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,080
essentially within the insurance context

214
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,440
one of the frustrations that we've got

215
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,280
is cyber liability is a very new type of

216
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,440
insurance and the thing we often lose

217
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,440
sight of with insurance is many of the

218
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,479
risks that you have within your

219
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,720
insurance program are very very old and

220
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,919
because of that there are established

221
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,440
markets there's hundreds of years worth

222
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,360
of data we know the risk we know the

223
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,599
exposure i've given you some examples of

224
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:58,880
some of the common insurances that

225
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,000
you'll see either for yourself

226
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,240
personally or also for your businesses

227
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,479
so property and fire what we call now

228
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,319
property isr pretty much every

229
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,240
organization has it either as a package

230
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,160
policy or by itself what we don't

231
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,599
realize is that's an insurance product

232
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,840
that's been around since the 1600s we

233
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,360
know about it we know about the wordings

234
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,120
we know about the issues we've talked

235
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,039
about life insurance again you can trace

236
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,440
life insurance back to the 1700s

237
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,199
even motor which i've listed up here

238
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,160
which we think of as something

239
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,680
relatively new because again the

240
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,520
technology and the availability the

241
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,160
first motor policy is over 120 years old

242
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,599
so there's a lot of data there's a lot

243
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,520
of knowledge when you start to shift

244
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,160
that to cyber cyber really spins out of

245
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,759
the types of technology insurance

246
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,440
products that the big banks and some of

247
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,599
the big us tech providers needed that

248
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,440
happens in the mid to late 90s depending

249
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,440
on who you speak to so that's the first

250
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,120
iteration of what is the backbone of the

251
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,120
modern cyber policy

252
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,560
the policies we talk about now that were

253
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,840
completely different they're modular

254
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,280
they've got ransomware cover they've got

255
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,440
bi that doesn't actually happen until

256
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,720
about 2002 2003 so when you look at the

257
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,479
shape of the insurance it is still

258
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,960
emerging it is still one where both the

259
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,560
risk class is changing but the

260
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,240
experience that insurers have it's

261
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,800
catching up as david politely said if

262
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,240
you took cyber insurance in terms of

263
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,919
human age it's barely allowed to drink

264
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:12,720
so

265
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,199
that context is quite important

266
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,440
in america in america where it's 21.

267
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,280
that's true um i'll cover these very

268
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,120
very quickly but essentially if you look

269
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,800
at why insurers struggle so much with

270
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,000
this and some of the tensions that they

271
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,879
face

272
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,960
claims data for cyber insurance is still

273
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,560
an emerging area

274
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,080
even some of the oldest data sets only

275
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,320
tend to go back about 15 years compare

276
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,080
that to other lines of insurance

277
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,679
exposure is much harder to understand

278
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,760
the tails are much harder to understand

279
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,360
so you can't rely on the claims data

280
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,719
just to build your raiders and what the

281
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,399
expenses are going to be

282
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,919
the premium pool has always been

283
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,360
relatively small compared to other

284
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,440
insurance classes we currently think the

285
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,800
australian premium pools somewhere

286
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,760
between 140 to 180 million changes

287
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,680
depending on who you speak to but if you

288
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,959
compare that to a lot of the other

289
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,279
classes you can get close to five six

290
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,519
seven hundred million so because of that

291
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,760
if we have a major change in frequency

292
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,200
if we have a lot more cyber events

293
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,800
occurring or a lot more losses the

294
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,399
premium pool has to grow very very

295
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,480
quickly so rates have to change

296
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,760
last one that i've talked about is the

297
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,279
evolving response

298
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,959
a long time ago when i first started

299
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,399
doing incident response and working with

300
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,800
carriers most of the expenses were legal

301
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,200
expenses for privacy or forensics

302
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,680
now as we'll talk about later bi

303
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,920
ransomware expenses are by and large the

304
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,839
biggest that's a whole new different

305
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,440
type of loss profile that the wordings

306
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,800
weren't really picking up six or seven

307
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,720
years ago so it changes the data it

308
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,200
changes how we understand it and also

309
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,360
we're in this really unusual place where

310
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,880
cyber is responding to what you do on

311
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,720
the data side on the security side or on

312
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,880
the tech service side the regulations

313
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,720
for that are constantly and shift even

314
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,320
now this year we've got the sake reforms

315
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,000
we've got the cdr rollouts we've got the

316
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,920
privacy code we've got a whole host of

317
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,440
new issues around consumer protection

318
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,519
for tech products and services because

319
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,959
the wording has to respond to those

320
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,880
risks it just shifts and it has to

321
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,880
change with the sands and that's why

322
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,560
price can be dynamic and coverage can be

323
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,600
very dynamic and again simply because of

324
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,959
that carriers have to be constantly

325
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,120
thinking who are they willing to ensure

326
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,480
what conditions or controls are they

327
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,720
going to apply and what's the price

328
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,320
that's why it kind of shifts and change

329
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,399
so much

330
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,839
this one i'll cover for you very very

331
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,079
quickly but what happens when you see

332
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,320
the cyber insurance industry is there a

333
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,000
series of kind of seismic events that

334
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,079
land and that changes what carriers do

335
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,680
so the coverage that they'll give what

336
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,720
the costs are going to be what the

337
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,920
conditions are

338
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,839
and i'll work you along these but i'll

339
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,200
start i suppose 2018 2019 so that's when

340
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,480
we see a lot more of the regulatory

341
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,240
stings start to come in that's where you

342
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,320
see some of the big gdpr fines that's

343
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,440
where you see some of the real risks

344
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,000
sitting around the ccpa come in we

345
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,120
talked about

346
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,800
the fines against

347
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,880
google facebook we've talked about some

348
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,720
of the issues in terms of the various

349
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,920
regulators across the globe that are

350
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,360
looking at these issues

351
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,040
but as those losses start to come in we

352
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,480
get a completely different profile for

353
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,320
the third party claims

354
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,160
ransomware had been around for a long

355
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,079
time um the oldest ransomware claim i'm

356
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,000
aware of the cyber policy responded to

357
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,959
is 2004 but you can't call that modern

358
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,720
ransomware in that case there it was a

359
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,640
twenty thousand dollar u.s

360
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,560
type of thing that they were demanding

361
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,920
big game hunting at least in the

362
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,480
insurance side it really lands in

363
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,800
mid 2020 and then it just keeps

364
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
accelerating and we've got some stats on

365
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,880
this later but the losses of ransomware

366
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,079
are nothing like what the market

367
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,120
predicted or what they could have

368
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,760
thought about three four years ago

369
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,160
supply chain will come to later it's

370
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,600
been a huge issue

371
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,000
both because of the size and the scale

372
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,279
of the problem which insurers probably

373
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,200
weren't across but also because when you

374
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,200
have a supply chain breach we can't

375
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,399
really have confidence in internal

376
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,920
controls some of the monitoring and some

377
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,760
of the behavioral might be able to do it

378
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,519
but supply chain is just this gaping

379
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,959
weakness really for even some of the

380
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,279
most mature organizations and we've seen

381
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,120
just some huge supply chain cyber

382
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,279
attacks we've talked about solar ends

383
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,279
we've got a cellion up there obviously

384
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,200
cassaya was a big one and there's even

385
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,560
been some reference to octa and some of

386
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,560
those types of things that are going on

387
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,639
i'll cover this one very quickly a lot

388
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,240
of those issues have stabilized but

389
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,240
there are a few emerging points that

390
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,320
we're trying to get to grips with one is

391
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,639
what to do with state-sponsored attacks

392
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,000
obviously that's slowed down a little

393
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,519
bit since the russia ukraine war but

394
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,720
there's an expectation that they will

395
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,320
come screamingly back towards the end of

396
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,200
the year

397
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,279
how do we think about the war issues we

398
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,560
don't think there's going to be another

399
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,920
not picture

400
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,519
but those issues have to be live and

401
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,360
have to be understood and what if there

402
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,600
is retaliation action that hangs off a

403
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,519
wall-like operation

404
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,880
again if you want to speak more about

405
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,160
that later we can talk about there's a

406
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,360
lot of nuance in terms of what the

407
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,760
market's doing and the last one is we

408
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,680
think there's probably a cat risk

409
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,920
associated with cyber by that i mean

410
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,200
that if you think about floods or the

411
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,120
traditional ones the catastrophe is what

412
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,320
we need to be worried about it's the

413
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,079
fact that we could have thousands of

414
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,600
losses being triggered either because of

415
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,160
a region or some type of seismic claim

416
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,600
cyber insurers didn't aggregate like

417
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,519
that historically but all the data is

418
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:50,959
pointing towards we have to think about

419
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,240
that because there are much more common

420
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,399
points of failure and we're also finding

421
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,519
that there are a lot of common

422
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,600
vulnerabilities or zero days that can

423
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,200
actually spread through supply chains

424
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,639
very very quickly

425
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:02,320
told you about rates there there is

426
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,839
rates going up

427
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,079
it can change a lot comes down to your

428
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,639
security your industry profile

429
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,240
and also what we can do to explain your

430
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,000
own maturity that's me

431
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,959
on this slide here i've got for you some

432
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:19,120
key elements of losses

433
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,279
this is based on a report that we put

434
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,279
together for uh all the claims that

435
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,839
willa saw in 2021 globally there's about

436
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,639
4 500 claims that sit amongst that

437
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,560
on the lost tale what we found was

438
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,560
business interruption is consistently

439
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,760
the highest loss for most of our

440
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,920
organizations that's either through lost

441
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,920
revenue or increased costs of working

442
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,519
we've also found that the payment of

443
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,279
ransoms is becoming a really significant

444
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,959
component of the loss that'll be a

445
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:44,880
common theme we'll play with a few times

446
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,839
but the thing i just want you to

447
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:48,240
understand is those aren't elements that

448
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,680
would have historically been part of the

449
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,760
exposure profile and it just shows that

450
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,279
how we understand the way this impacts

451
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,199
businesses the losses and the support

452
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,880
they need for cyber insurance is moving

453
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,360
very very quickly

454
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,680
yeah so going on from that if we look at

455
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,240
statistically um the number of claims

456
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,920
that have come through over time you

457
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:09,040
know we are seeing an incremental uh

458
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:13,279
increase concurrently year on year which

459
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:16,160
you can trend but

460
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,240
but if you uh if you consider the fact

461
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,880
that this is still an emerging risk um

462
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,279
there's still really no control as to

463
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,040
what's causing these ongoing increases

464
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,800
on the ransomware side i get this

465
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,079
question a lot how do we think about

466
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,160
ransomware losses so these are all of

467
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,639
the wtw clients we've had globally and

468
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,000
you can see the track of what was the

469
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,360
average demand that was made against

470
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,199
them what was the payment the demands

471
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:40,480
are still going up year on year that

472
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,399
we're seeing the payments are still

473
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,560
pretty static but you'll see now that if

474
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,079
the average ransomware payment is

475
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,560
scaling between that one to two million

476
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,160
because of the frequency because of the

477
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,399
amount of losses the whole total of

478
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:53,839
ransomware as an exposure and what it

479
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,440
means to industry and organizations has

480
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,600
just gone up i should say this is u.s

481
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,920
data our australian data is showing that

482
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,839
the average ransom payments somewhere

483
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,320
between about 900 k australian to 1.2

484
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,160
million australian so we're not quite as

485
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,040
bad but we are starting to trend up

486
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,800
yeah ironically

487
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,440
while we are historically seeing uh

488
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,760
higher costs on each claim we are

489
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,440
actually seeing either

490
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,360
the claimed volumes of the number of

491
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,120
incidents being reported or the number

492
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,600
of claims being lodged either stand

493
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,079
pretty steady this is data from cfc

494
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,920
which is one of the insurers they're

495
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,320
actually seeing claims volume drop

496
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,839
although other industries are also

497
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:35,920
seeing it stay pretty stagnant

498
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,680
so we wanted to very quickly talk about

499
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,800
some of the factors that you should

500
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,199
consider when you're trying to

501
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,880
look at whether insurance is appropriate

502
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,160
or necessary

503
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,240
the first thing that i say is we've got

504
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,560
to keep the context of you as a business

505
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,000
cyber insurance is expensive at the

506
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,600
moment it isn't always the only answer

507
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,040
that you need cyber insurance or that

508
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,800
you need big limits and one of the

509
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,480
things that we say is cyber insurance

510
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,759
should work as part of an overall risk

511
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,839
management strategy and when you start

512
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,120
to look at that through the lens we've

513
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,120
got to think about your exposure both

514
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,880
from a quantum but from a key risk type

515
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,880
of perspective and so what we see right

516
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,120
now is across different industries some

517
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,959
are just absolute targets in flavor of

518
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,320
the month we should have that as a bit

519
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,399
of context we should think about how

520
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,160
developed your ir response is how

521
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,399
developed your bcp processes are we

522
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,880
should think about bi legal and privacy

523
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,320
and a lot of the modern cyber security

524
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,000
frameworks are starting to bring this in

525
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,360
but i think you should have this joined

526
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,120
up to insurance and the thing about

527
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,639
insurance is i think it should be tied

528
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,160
to how you understand situational

529
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,240
awareness because it's your exposure

530
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,079
it's your support needs and it's how

531
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:35,519
does the policy come in for you that's

532
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,600
the critical question so again i think

533
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,959
always start with this as a bit of a

534
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,320
backbone and you'll make much more

535
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,720
effective decisions

536
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,399
i get a lot of questions around do you

537
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,240
don't you need insurance my answer is it

538
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,759
depends but there are a lot of common

539
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:48,880
factors that you should be thinking

540
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,240
about some organizations have a simpler

541
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,160
exposure profile a simple incident

542
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,320
response profile so often that comes

543
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,079
down to what type of personal

544
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,519
information and third party data are

545
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,639
they holding

546
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,000
what are customers or stakeholders going

547
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,799
to do if we have a cyber event how are

548
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,319
closely affected are you by the legal

549
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,160
and regulatory issues and what's going

550
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,439
to actually happen from an operational

551
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,880
perspective and we've got a number of

552
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,079
organizations that can answer that and

553
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,160
go low low low low limited well that

554
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,679
points to a smaller need for cyber

555
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,199
insurance or maybe the idea to

556
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,520
self-insure and not buy a policy i've

557
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,199
talked about irrelevant factors and this

558
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,359
comes in a lot at the moment so i get a

559
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,880
lot of reference to people saying well

560
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,079
we've done all this controls we've done

561
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,280
all this uplift

562
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,640
that's brilliant but the insurance

563
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,720
covers something different the insurance

564
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,000
is what you rely on when you have an

565
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,679
incident it's how you bring in the

566
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,000
vendors the support parties how you try

567
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,679
and make the business whole and also

568
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,120
it's how you think about the third party

569
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,120
and the civil liabilities and insurance

570
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,799
is one of the only tools that you've got

571
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,160
to actually think about that pure

572
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,240
recovery position and also to give you

573
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,000
general support across the response

574
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,039
steps

575
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,400
for those who are worried about losing

576
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,640
control what we essentially say is it's

577
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,320
your breach you control it's your

578
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,919
vendors if you work with the right

579
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,520
broking partner all of those issues can

580
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,799
be managed

581
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,039
insurers do play claims i can give you a

582
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,120
whole bunch of proof i personally worked

583
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,559
on over 10 matters where the insurers

584
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,559
paid out in excess of 10 million

585
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,080
the losses are real the reason why

586
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,160
premiums are going up is because of just

587
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,840
how significant the financial harms are

588
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,200
that sit here

589
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,799
and the last one is in terms of if you

590
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,559
can or can't obtain insurance we'll

591
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,320
cover this later pretty much all

592
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,600
organizations are insurable at the

593
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,440
moment you've just got to do the work on

594
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,880
the proposals and in terms of the

595
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,520
strategy for how we communicate security

596
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,799
i've given you some ideas on when i

597
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,240
think cyber insurance is very very

598
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,160
important a lot of these will be common

599
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,360
in terms of how you think about risk

600
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,360
assessments the two that i just want to

601
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,600
hide in is how we think about technology

602
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,760
dependency if there is a cyber security

603
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,760
event key assets are unavailable key

604
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,240
systems are unavailable what's the loss

605
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,760
because in that type of situation there

606
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,200
we have a much clearer idea of business

607
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,400
interruption

608
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,679
the last one that i'll mention here as

609
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,200
well is how we think about expert vendor

610
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,160
support

611
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,679
insurers have a full incident response

612
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,600
panel that they've developed the rates

613
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,120
are better typically the levels of

614
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,320
service they get are better than what

615
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,320
you can negotiate individually so there

616
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,000
are real benefits in terms of using this

617
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,240
to augment instant response from the

618
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,480
cyber crisis management side

619
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,000
i'll probably add on that as well like

620
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,200
in the middle of an incident do you

621
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,480
really want to be trying to work out who

622
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,039
your panelists are for most small to

623
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,240
medium business small to medium

624
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,919
enterprise it's not something they've

625
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,360
had to consider

626
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,919
the cyber insurer is motivated to have

627
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:19,520
gone and pre-picked them unless you are

628
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,360
mature enough to have picked your own

629
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,760
panel for ir or whatever

630
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,000
and i think a lot of people forget that

631
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,840
cyber insurance is more than just an

632
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,760
insurance policy that you get your money

633
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,559
back on bi and everything else

634
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,720
it gives you in essence access to the

635
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,720
panel beta who's going to help repair

636
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,559
your business and also worked out who

637
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,919
was at fault

638
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:40,640
but

639
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,960
in trying to work out whether or not

640
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,559
cyber insurance is appropriate or

641
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,799
necessary um

642
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,799
the insurers are trying to assess

643
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:52,000
maturity of each and every applicant for

644
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:52,799
the

645
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:53,919
policy

646
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,880
and the problem we have at the moment is

647
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,039
they're playing catch-up and so

648
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,720
they're looking at what's caused to

649
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,559
claim after a claim

650
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:05,200
what controls may have helped uh resolve

651
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,880
that they're trying to work out are

652
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,720
there certain frameworks we should work

653
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,120
by uh and as you as an insured should

654
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,640
also be trying to work is is there a

655
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,960
framework we can align with that

656
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,720
actually helps us

657
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,880
closely align with what our cyber

658
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,200
insurer is looking for

659
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,000
and

660
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,880
there may be a need for you as a mature

661
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,679
organization to demonstrate that you are

662
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,520
actually mature by doing regular pen

663
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,760
tests or at least security assessments

664
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,799
to show your thinking about the the

665
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,280
requirements um and a question i get

666
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,960
asked all the time is do we need iso

667
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,080
2701 or any of the other certifications

668
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,159
and for the most part that's a tick and

669
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,640
flick exercise and it actually doesn't

670
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,480
align with what

671
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,400
cyber insurers are actually looking at

672
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,000
as causes for uh for claim volume

673
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,600
you might need that for regulatory

674
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,600
compliance in other aspects but it may

675
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,039
not actually get you to where you need

676
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,480
to be a

677
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,200
low-risk insured

678
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,640
so for the next couple of slides we're

679
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,600
going to talk about what are the

680
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,039
controls insurers are focused on and

681
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,480
what's the reason why

682
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,840
and some of these are very similar to

683
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,919
what we'll see with essential 8 or nist

684
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,640
or iso but in my mind there are 8 things

685
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,320
that insurers really really are

686
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,159
sensitive to at the moment and this is

687
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:19,600
because insurers have seen where these

688
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,280
controls fail they actually cause losses

689
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,280
and they cause significant events

690
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,039
access management is very very much

691
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,640
front and center

692
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,080
again they're not going to prescribe

693
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,840
types of technology but they do want to

694
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,360
see some approach to privileged access

695
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
management and also we're really really

696
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,880
worried about the local admins the

697
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,039
domains those types of accounts what are

698
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,320
the controls there are they're just in

699
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,840
time credentials

700
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,440
asset management is an interesting one

701
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,880
and that what we find is for a lot of

702
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,720
organizations if they haven't done the

703
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,320
asset management work when you want the

704
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,080
incident response providers to come in

705
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,240
they have no idea where stuff is so the

706
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,320
triage is much slower the preservation

707
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,240
is much slower how we look at elements

708
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,240
of the restoration is much slower so the

709
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,520
work we can do then to get that

710
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,760
visibility to get that inventory

711
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,640
segmentation again common issue insurers

712
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,000
are very very much focused on that i

713
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,039
think particularly around some of the

714
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:06,240
issues that we're seeing with cloud at

715
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,520
the moment

716
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,520
active monitoring a lot of insurers as

717
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,840
you get into a more secure state they

718
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,919
will want some type of seam or sock

719
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,600
they're pretty vendor agnostic they're

720
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,120
also agnostic on whether it needs to be

721
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,440
in-house or whether it can be outsourced

722
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,000
mfa is central for all the carriers at

723
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,840
the moment they want it on critical

724
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,760
systems most of them want on universal

725
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,720
rollout on 100 of endpoints um edr we're

726
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,880
aware of phishing training the last one

727
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,039
i mentioned is backup processes this has

728
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,480
been something that we've seen shift in

729
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,320
the last 12 months insurers were quite

730
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,159
light touch on what they asked here now

731
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,200
they want to know things about our

732
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,120
backups encrypted uh what some of the

733
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,880
passwords that sit around it are they

734
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,960
actually immutable have we done point in

735
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,880
time restoration how have we thought

736
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,600
about on-site offsite cloud and you can

737
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,880
comment on this but i think the main

738
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,960
reason is ransomware losses are

739
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,240
completely different depending when

740
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,159
we've got reliable backups or not yeah

741
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,559
100 i mean you think about from a bi

742
00:22:58,559 --> 00:22:59,919
perspective business interruption

743
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,679
perspective if you've got a backup that

744
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,039
actually works and you can pull down

745
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,440
pretty quickly uh then business

746
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,880
interruption is going to be minimized

747
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,280
and you know no two backup is created

748
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,159
equal

749
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,840
a lot of businesses will still use tape

750
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,679
backups and of course like the old vhs

751
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,039
there's no guarantee that thing will

752
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,880
actually work when you go to use it

753
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,799
the same with cloud backups you know no

754
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,799
no two cloud providers

755
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,720
are the same and we've seen on some of

756
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,120
the incidents we've worked where all of

757
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,480
a sudden they've gone to restore from

758
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,080
their you

759
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,440
cloud provider

760
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,440
and it trickles down or there's no

761
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,280
option to have a disk sent out to them

762
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,679
rapidly so that you can try and restore

763
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,760
and now we're going back to try and

764
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,000
recreate everything and it it ends up

765
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,840
with this cost that the business wasn't

766
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,279
expecting

767
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,200
or because they cheaped out on on the

768
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,840
backup system

769
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,200
what we wanted to do for the next few

770
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,440
slides is try and give some context on

771
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,200
why insurers ask a number of the

772
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,880
additional questions that they do and

773
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,159
this is some work we've done internally

774
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,520
within willis towers watson but the

775
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,200
thing that we've mapped is there are

776
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,799
certain claims that insurers have paid

777
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,559
out a lot on and you can very quickly

778
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:03,919
map the controls and what they're trying

779
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,000
to do to those types of claims

780
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,440
there's been a bit of talk about supply

781
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,640
chain is there anything that you want to

782
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,960
add quickly there yeah i mean supply

783
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,200
chain's a hard one i we've got an msp at

784
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,640
the moment that's um

785
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,400
that's been hit and and they are

786
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,880
becoming an uninsurable risk

787
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,600
because of the level of information they

788
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,039
store but

789
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,960
you know how do you grill your supply

790
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,480
chain how do you find out whether or not

791
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,240
your supply chain is actually doing

792
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,200
security tests and everything else

793
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,120
even this morning we heard from octa uh

794
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,640
you know they're in damage control at

795
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,120
the moment due to a supply issue

796
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,120
uh and it's going to be a growing

797
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,840
problem that we continue to see evolve i

798
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,919
agree with um brett whittiford that if

799
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,840
anyone works that challenge out i think

800
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,600
we'll all be winning

801
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,200
but if we look at the supply chain

802
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,960
attack some of the key things that

803
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,159
they're going to start looking at is are

804
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,240
you actually examining

805
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,880
how they access your systems from msp

806
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,320
for example

807
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,120
we see because msps aren't a regulated

808
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,279
industry we see a lot of msps who aren't

809
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,840
using mfa to remotely access their

810
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,840
clients environments uh shared

811
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,880
credentials uh maybe they're overly

812
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,520
exposed or not updating their systems or

813
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,039
there's no lines of demarcation or

814
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,320
network segmentation between them

815
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,240
and the two bits that i'll add on my

816
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,960
site is there is a lot of emphasis

817
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,400
around understanding what are you

818
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,679
outsourcing

819
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,279
who's it being outsourced to what are

820
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,120
the processes and controls and this has

821
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,559
been a bit of a surprise to me that even

822
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,000
some of the really heavily regulated

823
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,760
industries they don't have clear ideas

824
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,600
of okay well we think it's kind of a hr

825
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,520
function well what's actually happening

826
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,520
there so that visibility that

827
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,520
understanding of the msp relationship

828
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,640
and kind of getting to some of the

829
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,159
business purposes because again if we

830
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,440
know what data they're holding why

831
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,640
they're holding it what the impact is of

832
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,799
the business we can understand much more

833
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,799
what the risk is if that msp goes down

834
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,320
from a cyber event

835
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,760
last one i'll mention is the patching

836
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,600
cadence you'll see this come up a few

837
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,000
times but i think for insurers what has

838
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,760
really surprised them is we get a lot of

839
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,840
cyber events that are caused from what

840
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,400
are known cves in some cases i've seen

841
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,000
some massive ones where they've been cbs

842
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,279
and the remediation's been reported for

843
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,120
365 days

844
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,720
that is just something that has kind of

845
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,480
set insurers off because it is

846
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,080
preventable there are some challenges

847
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,080
with visibility but that is a very very

848
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,520
big issue and we've got to show those

849
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,200
elements of the patching cadence

850
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,279
particularly for critical cves

851
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,440
yeah just add on to that um some good

852
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,000
examples in the last couple of years

853
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,520
obviously when everyone went into the

854
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,679
work from home environment rdp getting a

855
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,840
remote desktop protocol being popped was

856
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,600
a really common

857
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,799
affair

858
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,640
then the threat actors moved on to there

859
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,120
was a well-known firewall vendor that

860
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,080
had a cve which allowed the password

861
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,080
database out of the the firewall to be

862
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,520
pulled out of memory

863
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,600
uh and all of a sudden we saw any client

864
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,360
who had that particular brand firewall

865
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,760
get popped because the it team couldn't

866
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,840
schedule in a time to do the firmware

867
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,760
update for the firewall because business

868
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,840
wants to run 24 7

869
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,039
and that's just not good enough anymore

870
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,480
moving on though we've seen a lot of

871
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,760
watering hole attacks so what we're

872
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,320
talking about there is um you know being

873
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,000
brought to a particular website we saw

874
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,320
this with a lot of legal and uh sort of

875
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:13,200
paralegal contractual based businesses

876
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,679
uh where they would end up downloading

877
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,679
something that dropped a remote access

878
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,880
trojan on the end point of the device

879
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,720
and then that

880
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,279
thread actor would come in via a tunnel

881
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,640
back to the head office and then

882
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,720
ransomware the environment and so as a

883
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,240
byproduct we're seeing the insurers

884
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,159
looking at okay well how are we going to

885
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,159
train our staff not to click on these

886
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,559
things in this particular example

887
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,880
the paralegal was actually trying to

888
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,240
speed up their work by finding a

889
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,600
template for

890
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,720
the contract that they were looking for

891
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,799
and and just got thrown out

892
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,799
we're also looking at things that are

893
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,640
mentioned in the essential 8 has been

894
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,880
said is like can we disable

895
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,440
microsoft office macros you speak to a

896
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,600
lot of law firms accounting firms they

897
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,679
quite often depend on these things and

898
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,279
they get sent these things and yes there

899
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,799
are ways around configuring that

900
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:03,840
properly

901
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,520
but there's there's always been a

902
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,039
balance of

903
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:09,919
interrupting business operation versus

904
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,760
security and it's getting to a point

905
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,679
where we actually have to start

906
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:16,320
rethinking some of those conversations

907
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,799
because the fact that we are blocking

908
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:21,600
the business from operating uh is not a

909
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,679
good answer for security but there has

910
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,559
to be still some um

911
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,960
a little bit of a fair play as well

912
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,399
and so we particularly see with some

913
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,240
organizations that are highly exposed to

914
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,760
watering hole attacks there will be a

915
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,120
lot more questions around what is the

916
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,600
education what's the training how are we

917
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,799
thinking about some of the social

918
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,159
engineering or the malicious issues that

919
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,760
can hang off the back of it

920
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,960
and that's a comment that will probably

921
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,880
give to a lot of organizations this year

922
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,159
historically you could get away with

923
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,000
saying well we do a once a year cyber

924
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,520
security training it's general it's from

925
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,120
this outsourced provider and that'll

926
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,399
just be a bit of a tick and flick for

927
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,320
the insurers now they want to understand

928
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,440
a little bit more because there's a

929
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,520
difference between base education and

930
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,799
education that's effective

931
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:03,200
i mean in some ways this is quite

932
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,600
obvious but i'll let you fire yeah i

933
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,360
mean i just covered off this as well

934
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,440
open remote access surprisingly we still

935
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,080
see this in fact uh there was again

936
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,080
another well-known vendor recently that

937
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,360
um prioritizes uh remote access uh it

938
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,200
was actually a log4j vulnerability in

939
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,480
this one but

940
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,200
we see all of these services available

941
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,120
particularly remote desktop and then

942
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,679
something like a printer

943
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,360
account or something with a really poor

944
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,039
password and

945
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,559
you know the msp that we're talking to

946
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,240
says oh but we have a brute force

947
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,320
program and blah blah blah and so we've

948
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,919
got to start looking at you know how do

949
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,000
we secure these environments i know ben

950
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,360
and i were talking about before you know

951
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,440
this whole xero trust world everyone's

952
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,919
talking about zero trust because most

953
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,080
businesses when we had to go remote just

954
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,919
spun up vpn concentrators and the vpn

955
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,080
concentrators didn't necessarily secure

956
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,919
us properly

957
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,679
i think the two bits that i'll add here

958
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,440
is it always surprises me when we go

959
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,559
through this process the number of

960
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,480
organizations where we'll often do a

961
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,919
third party assessment for some of these

962
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,600
large ones where they do insurance and

963
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,200
you might have an organization that is

964
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,279
very cyber makira but when we do this

965
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,039
external assessment there are 30 or 40

966
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,520
instances we find of open idp so it's

967
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,960
something that i think is probably hard

968
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,960
from the visibility side but again it's

969
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,880
such a low hanging fruit that it amazes

970
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,559
you in some cases it's big financial

971
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,799
services or

972
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:24,880
highly highly regulated industries so

973
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,440
again simple but it comes up all the

974
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,679
time

975
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,000
obviously credential stuffing phishing

976
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,720
attacks no one's surprised there

977
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,960
again we're talking about mfa i mean mfa

978
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,919
is the trend here and education um as

979
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,080
well as what's on the endpoint uh and

980
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:46,640
behavioral detection based capabilities

981
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,159
uh business email conference is your

982
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,919
favorite topic yeah my caseload at the

983
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:52,000
moment 66 of my caseload is business

984
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,679
email compromise this doesn't seem to be

985
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:54,960
going away and what we're actually

986
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,640
seeing is a lot of insurers are now

987
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,240
getting to a point where if you don't

988
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,080
have an mfa enabled

989
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,320
they won't give you a policy and

990
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,480
it's about time because they're losing

991
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,080
when they do the investigation it's not

992
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,159
just the investigation into how did this

993
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:09,279
occur

994
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:11,120
if there is some sort of active data

995
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,559
exfiltration and a privacy obligation

996
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,799
there's a huge cost that goes into data

997
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:20,240
mining notification pr etc and the

998
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,519
insurers really don't want to cop the

999
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:24,240
bill on that one

1000
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,240
ransomware i'll make some quick comments

1001
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,919
and hand over to you

1002
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:30,000
it's such a huge problem the losses and

1003
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,279
the expenses

1004
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,720
most of the insurers have specific

1005
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,559
addendums now of ransomware controls

1006
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,399
that they want to see and it's just

1007
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,080
because they have been burnt to death on

1008
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,320
it so we've given you some examples here

1009
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,000
but we often say that if we've got a

1010
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,080
large or a complex organization we want

1011
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,360
to communicate to the insurer what is

1012
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,120
your strategy to manage ransomware as an

1013
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,640
end-to-end risk

1014
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,320
and where we can do that

1015
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,320
two things i will also call out we see a

1016
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,320
lot more focus now on testing and living

1017
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,039
the ir and the bcp processes so that's

1018
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,519
tabletops that's policies that's wording

1019
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,000
reviews that's also issues though around

1020
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,600
showing that we've made these types of

1021
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,440
processes fit for purpose

1022
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,559
and the other one that i'll just mention

1023
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,640
too is the restoration and testing and

1024
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,640
backups

1025
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,480
the lost tales are just so fundamentally

1026
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,840
different if you don't have confidence

1027
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,360
in the backup process

1028
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,080
yeah and just go on to the next one

1029
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:20,720
to put that into perspective we saw an

1030
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,880
average ransom payment of 400 000 in

1031
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,000
2019 that nearly tripled to 1.1 million

1032
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,679
in 2020

1033
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,480
and those numbers keep going up

1034
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,600
the

1035
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,960
biggest

1036
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,320
victims of this we see are legal

1037
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,240
financial and professional service firms

1038
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,399
and one of the reasons they're the legal

1039
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,320
in particular it's not because they need

1040
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,880
to pay the ransom to get the data back

1041
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,919
it's because they don't want to have

1042
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:44,960
their name

1043
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,399
published

1044
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:49,120
on the breach sites and

1045
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,279
quite often they'll weigh that up and

1046
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,919
pay the the ransom on the good faith

1047
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:56,480
that the the ransom threat actors will

1048
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,159
uh delete that data

1049
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:00,320
but almost every incident we look at

1050
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,480
if we really dial it down the security

1051
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,240
controls weren't the right ones they

1052
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,679
weren't controlled and no one was

1053
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,640
monitoring them 24 7.

1054
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,559
i think two things i'll add obviously

1055
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,159
the ransom payment is a big headline

1056
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:13,840
cost but we often lose sight of the

1057
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840
other costs and expenses ransomware

1058
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,039
event is where someone has had

1059
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:19,679
unauthorized access to data protanto

1060
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:20,960
there's almost always a risk of an

1061
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,559
eligible data breach so the privacy

1062
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,640
liability element is there data

1063
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,240
restoration costs are always very very

1064
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,000
high the bi costs are always very very

1065
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,080
high the contraction on the third party

1066
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,640
costs are also increasing so ransomware

1067
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,240
is one where if you look at the totality

1068
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,159
of a cyber event you kind of get the

1069
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,679
highest levels of losses across the

1070
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:39,679
board

1071
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,360
this is just a very very quick slide

1072
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,559
there's been a lot of doom and gloom

1073
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,559
there was an afr article published a few

1074
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,880
days ago talking about insurance being

1075
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,480
impossible to obtain

1076
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,919
lots of doom and gloom the market's

1077
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,320
dying there's an existential crisis most

1078
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,120
of that is rubbish what we really see is

1079
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,799
for a long time you could get a cyber

1080
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,880
insurance policy really really easily i

1081
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,559
answer five questions i go to ten

1082
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,720
carriers five of them quote i pick the

1083
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,640
lowest and that's fine when the losses

1084
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,399
are low but now that the losses are much

1085
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:08,719
much higher carriers are reselective and

1086
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,839
you need to make sure that you're

1087
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,440
actually advocating for what your

1088
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,560
business is doing and how you think

1089
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,719
about cyber security what we're finding

1090
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,639
is it's kind of the 10 or 15 percent

1091
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,879
most immature organizations they can't

1092
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,560
get that insurance and that's deliberate

1093
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,079
the carriers want to show risk selection

1094
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,918
they want to show a level of risk that

1095
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,760
they're declining but in the case for

1096
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,040
most of those organizations they've got

1097
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,119
a lot of low-hanging fruit often you can

1098
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,480
work with them for three to six months

1099
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,679
and we can actually get them to a point

1100
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,280
where they are insurable we've

1101
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,119
personally found that every risk we've

1102
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,480
worked with on the last 18 months has

1103
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,159
been able to get terms and that's some

1104
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,520
really scary things that's defense

1105
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,199
contractors it's online gambling

1106
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:44,159
companies it's highly regulated sectors

1107
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,639
we've got five minutes so um other thing

1108
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,800
i'll say here is when you do a proposal

1109
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,199
form don't answer no to 20 questions and

1110
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,639
expect to be okay

1111
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,239
each of those are red flags for the

1112
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,839
writer so if you're going to do a no

1113
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,599
contextualize it or explain what the

1114
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,359
mitigating controls and circumstances

1115
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:00,320
are

1116
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,480
a very very quick one from me

1117
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,839
how do you actually go about getting

1118
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,839
insurance whatever the broker is you

1119
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,680
should be engaging with them you should

1120
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,040
think about the cyber very very

1121
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,560
carefully what the limit is what you

1122
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,560
need you should also decide what's the

1123
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,280
strategy what are the key requirements

1124
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,200
understand the exposure work on the

1125
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,359
proposal forms and make sure that when

1126
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:20,960
the insurer is asking you questions you

1127
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,800
don't just say oh no too difficult

1128
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,240
they're asking a question because it's a

1129
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,320
red flag on the radar that's the things

1130
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,599
we want to answer that's the things that

1131
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,040
we want to push down

1132
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,720
and finally because you're paying a lot

1133
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,800
for insurance get the confidence from

1134
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,240
the broker or the partner to understand

1135
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,400
what's being covered what isn't and make

1136
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,760
sure that you ask these questions

1137
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,880
because you're going to rely on this if

1138
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,880
you have a catastrophic cyber event so

1139
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,240
it might as well be fit for purpose and

1140
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,560
providing good value i think we're

1141
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,839
pretty good any

1142
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,680
questions for us

1143
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,839
oh thank you caught me by surprise there

1144
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,000
uh so thank you very much uh we have a

1145
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:55,360
round of applause please for ben david

1146
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,359
[Applause]

1147
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:00,480
there are a few questions online so kind

1148
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,359
of i'll start from the earliest ones

1149
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,920
um

1150
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,599
i'll ask it anyway it might be a little

1151
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,599
bit tongue-in-cheek uh why will

1152
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,280
insurance cover ransomware payments but

1153
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,440
won't cover a stolen car when my when i

1154
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,800
left it unlocked

1155
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,240
won't cover a stolen car when you left

1156
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,079
it unlocked well normally for that it's

1157
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:20,240
because there's a reasonable precautions

1158
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,160
type of provision in the policy

1159
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,520
ransomware's a bit different you can be

1160
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,280
as reasonable as you want but

1161
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,960
again it's a malicious actor that might

1162
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:29,040
have been scoping the environment for 6

1163
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,160
12 months

1164
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,760
i also think the thing about ransomware

1165
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,200
is we cover it because we understand how

1166
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,119
catastrophic it is for the business for

1167
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,400
some of these businesses it's a going

1168
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,400
concern issue we don't pay the ransom

1169
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,680
because we want to but particularly if

1170
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,000
we don't have backups

1171
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,599
the options are catastrophic so it's

1172
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,119
also about actually giving the business

1173
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,440
the opportunity for what might otherwise

1174
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,520
be a huge issue in the short term and

1175
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,520
the long term i was going to say too the

1176
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,200
insurer typically doesn't pay the ransom

1177
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,920
direct the insurer does pay the ransom

1178
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,640
the insurer reimburses the insured for

1179
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:01,920
costs um born out of that incident which

1180
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,440
so you pay the ransom yourself and the

1181
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,599
insurer can reimburse you after the fact

1182
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:06,960
so it's always your decision and you

1183
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,800
always own it oh that's great because

1184
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,640
there's a question around does insuring

1185
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,520
rental payments drive up ransom's demand

1186
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,760
should insuring or even paying ransoms

1187
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,160
be made illegal and there's another

1188
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,560
question further up uh is it legal to

1189
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,440
pay a ransom i'll cover those two so

1190
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,800
there's nothing that prevents you from

1191
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,800
playing a ransom generally that can be

1192
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,720
into plays with anti-terrorism financing

1193
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,320
law that can be into place with money

1194
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,079
laundering they can be into place with

1195
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,760
sanctions but that's very much based on

1196
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,119
who's it going to and what's the payment

1197
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,400
chain so it's not

1198
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,760
illegal generally the issue of does

1199
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,920
insurers drive up ransom payments i've

1200
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,520
always thought it's a nonsense the

1201
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,920
malicious actor is looking at leverage

1202
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,280
the fact you've got an insurance policy

1203
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,240
really isn't here all there if they've

1204
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,440
got your critical data and you don't

1205
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,480
have a backup

1206
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,839
i've seen some where they'll bathe it on

1207
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:54,160
percentage of your overall revenue

1208
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,520
but you always have these policy people

1209
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,359
that come up every 18 months saying oh

1210
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,400
the reason why the ransomware

1211
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,760
environment is so bad is because of

1212
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,720
insurance

1213
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,640
if i'm a malicious actor insurance is

1214
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,880
the ninth or tenth most important thing

1215
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,240
if i've got your backups if i've got

1216
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,920
stakeholder records if i've got critical

1217
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:12,000
pi that's the reason why you'll pay

1218
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,760
and are you seeing insurers recovering

1219
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,839
costs from dodgy security planning or

1220
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,119
dodgy audits or even dodgy cfos

1221
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,359
optimistic insurance proposals

1222
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:23,440
so i can comment on this do you want to

1223
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,680
have a stab oh mine mine would be very

1224
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,040
vicious

1225
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,200
i think they're trying to

1226
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,920
do recovery but it's difficult and again

1227
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,640
come back to my comment about msps mssps

1228
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,960
being a very unregulated industry

1229
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:40,000
um the contracts aren't great and they

1230
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,720
they're very airy fairy so it's hard to

1231
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,040
to really point the finger but um

1232
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,400
there's always been a bit of a trend of

1233
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,760
how do we recover the losses for an

1234
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,119
organization after they've had a cyber

1235
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,280
event um we do see a couple of these

1236
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,800
they're quite hard to succeed in for the

1237
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,240
it provider

1238
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,680
i think we'll see more because of where

1239
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,320
the loss tales go and as

1240
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,640
my good friends mentioned you can often

1241
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,760
point to some really fundamental

1242
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,880
negligence particularly if it's a

1243
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,320
security managed service provider when

1244
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,240
we have these critical events so we'll

1245
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,160
continue to look at it um but it won't

1246
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,920
be the easy answer or the silver line

1247
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,680
bullet

1248
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:14,800
ah there's a few more um so how many

1249
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:18,079
insured invalidate their policy by not

1250
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:20,000
notifying their insurer

1251
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,680
you don't invalidate your policy but the

1252
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,000
thing about it is notification creates

1253
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,839
your rights under the wording so like

1254
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:27,280
all contracts we need a trigger a

1255
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,440
condition before whatever the

1256
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,720
counterparty is going to take certain

1257
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,040
steps so we notify early we make the

1258
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,200
wording live we give you the benefits if

1259
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,800
you notify late the wording will still

1260
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,320
respond but there might be prejudice

1261
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,520
where you might have done things that

1262
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,359
weren't covered or things that the

1263
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,119
insurer could have managed differently

1264
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,960
so you won't invalidate the wording but

1265
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,480
you reduce the benefit that you get from

1266
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,320
the policy so early notification is

1267
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,880
always the best idea so for those making

1268
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,720
a incident secured response plan or

1269
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,920
playbook that should be probably yeah

1270
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,359
and most insurers actually would like

1271
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,920
you to notify even if it turns into a

1272
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,320
nothing burger um because they can

1273
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,240
assist you like this whole pan having a

1274
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,720
panel again for an smb sme um having

1275
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,720
someone who can fact check you know the

1276
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,920
thing that you're freaking out about um

1277
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,440
means that if it is something they're

1278
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,800
already there for the journey if it's

1279
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,400
not they can they've got intelligent

1280
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:20,000
teams that can stand that down

1281
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,200
uh do insurers allow no sorry to

1282
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,280
insurers insurance providers allow for

1283
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,319
reducing premiums or excess if clients

1284
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:32,480
can show cyber security mitigating

1285
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,960
controls or policies etc

1286
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,440
uh i'll cover that first maybe two three

1287
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,359
years ago you would have but right now

1288
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:40,960
for most of the insurers it's a minimum

1289
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,640
security requirement just for them to

1290
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,400
quote if you don't hit the minimum they

1291
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,079
don't want to touch you

1292
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:48,319
in some situations there may be some

1293
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,640
small discounts but the reality is the

1294
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,119
losses are so big and so significant

1295
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,119
discounting is very very difficult to

1296
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,960
justify so very rarely now

1297
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,920
cool uh do insurers care if an

1298
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,079
organization has a policy

1299
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,800
of not paying ransoms especially if it

1300
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,560
can be demonstrated that controls are in

1301
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,640
place and working

1302
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,240
i think insurers like the fact that

1303
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:13,440
you've thought about it so if you've got

1304
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,200
some type of policy or agreed company

1305
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,800
strategy it shows a level of

1306
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,160
preparedness and that's quite good for

1307
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,640
an irbcp process you may have a

1308
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,000
different view i think insurers will

1309
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,760
always look at that a bit cynically i

1310
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,280
know a whole bunch of organizations that

1311
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,119
had a whole of business policies not to

1312
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:29,200
deal with extortions and ransomware

1313
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,960
payments but again if you don't have

1314
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,040
backups if you've got huge operational

1315
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,800
issues

1316
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,040
it's just not that simple so it shows

1317
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:38,560
that you've thought about it but

1318
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,640
insurers won't take that as a binding

1319
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,560
that you will never pay around them

1320
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:45,200
fantastic with that we are out of time

1321
