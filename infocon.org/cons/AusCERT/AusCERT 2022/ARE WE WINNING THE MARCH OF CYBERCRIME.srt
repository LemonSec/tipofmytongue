25
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,879
uh yeah thanks heaps for having me um

26
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,000
this is a bit of a different

27
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,320
presentation um than i sort of normally

28
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,039
do

29
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,160
i sort of

30
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,320
i sat down i thought about i've been

31
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,760
doing this for a long time and i thought

32
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,320
about how cyber crime has evolved and

33
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,360
changed over the last 20 to 25 years and

34
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,400
i thought i'd try and sort of

35
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,479
contextualize it for people because

36
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:09,600
there are a lot of people who are

37
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,680
relatively new to this space and i say

38
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,280
relatively new meaning less than 10

39
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,880
years less than 15 years they're not as

40
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,200
old and bald as me um so i thought i'd

41
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,240
give you a bit of a history lesson so we

42
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,280
can understand

43
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,280
how we got where we are

44
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,920
and you know what we did to advance our

45
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,439
detections and preventions and all that

46
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,040
sort of stuff to get to where we are now

47
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,600
so yeah so who i am been doing this for

48
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,640
a while casinos afp for a good period of

49
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,439
my life um and now i head up apj

50
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,040
research for threat intelligence for

51
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,640
secure works

52
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,960
and i don't know anything else than this

53
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,960
um i did sit down one day and sort of

54
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,960
thought to myself well if all this cyber

55
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,560
crime stuff goes away what else could i

56
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,040
do and i really can't do anything else

57
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,119
so i'm kind of stuck in this niche i've

58
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,280
dug for myself but i seem to be pretty

59
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,119
good at it so

60
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,640
how i thought i would

61
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,680
frame this discussion is around loss per

62
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,880
event

63
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,799
so we talk about loss per fraud event

64
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,880
loss per attack event loss per you know

65
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,759
crime event and sort of go way back to

66
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:09,598
when i first started this out

67
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,319
and we talked about about 500 bucks

68
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,120
so

69
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,920
back in sort of the early 2000s uh about

70
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,280
2002

71
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,360
i was just starting out as a security

72
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,720
analyst a network security analyst back

73
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,720
at the time and this thing called

74
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,560
phishing started to happen

75
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,360
now

76
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,959
i need you to all go with me on this and

77
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,560
understand that when i talk about some

78
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,080
of these attacks from 20 15 20 years ago

79
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,680
we didn't have the detections that we

80
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,120
have now we didn't have the nice seams

81
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,319
and all these automated systems so we

82
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,200
were working with notepad and maybe a

83
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,040
spreadsheet if you're lucky so don't

84
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,239
think we were done we just didn't have

85
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,120
the stuff that you guys have these days

86
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,200
we built that stuff so the interesting

87
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,200
part about dumb fishing which is you

88
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,000
know really basic php writes out stolen

89
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,239
credentials to a text file stored on a

90
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,000
hacked site somewhere

91
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,840
but the time that started happening was

92
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,120
around the time when we were first

93
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,280
rolling out internet banking

94
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,959
now internet banking is an interesting

95
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,840
one because as financial institutions

96
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,760
we wanted people to want to use internet

97
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,720
banking

98
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,400
right and i'm not telling stories out of

99
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,680
school this is you know old enough now

100
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,959
but

101
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,959
the basic maths was if you went into a

102
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,720
branch to do a transaction it cost the

103
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,120
bank about five bucks roughly if you do

104
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,720
the same transaction online cost the

105
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,879
bank about five cents so

106
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,959
at the time it was make people have

107
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,640
confidence in the channel that was the

108
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,920
big buzzword was confidence in the

109
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,360
channel make people want to use internet

110
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,959
banking and then this fishing stuff

111
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,959
started coming out and all hell broke

112
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,959
loose the panic was palpable

113
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,720
because what if people don't trust

114
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,720
internet banking what people don't want

115
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,680
to use

116
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,400
internet banking to do their

117
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,519
transactions what if they go back to

118
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,920
branches god forbid

119
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,680
so we we had to we worked very quickly

120
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,040
to try and get these fishing sites taken

121
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,200
down because it was massive amounts of

122
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,879
panic now as i said there were really

123
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,799
basic sort of fishing sites at the time

124
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:54,480
but they still work you know the little

125
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,920
easter egg in the slide is the date on

126
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,680
that one is sort of mid last year this

127
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,159
stuff still works right but as

128
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,840
responders we started to build up a bit

129
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,360
of a database of an understanding as to

130
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,959
what these sites were how they how they

131
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,400
worked there were certain kits that

132
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,439
you'd see time and time again and

133
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,920
as you started to work with

134
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,760
site owners who have been compromised

135
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,120
basically begging them to take it down

136
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,560
you'd start to get copies of the zip

137
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,639
file you know the basic idea was

138
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,040
wordpress vulnerability upload zip file

139
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,960
or tarball expand send out phishing

140
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,240
emails

141
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,720
go go make some money so we both have

142
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,720
these nice little lists of where they

143
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,040
would store the credentials locally

144
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,320
as i said they'd write them out to a

145
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,720
text file right so result.txt or

146
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,080
whatever would just and would have it so

147
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,240
as responders you just browse to that go

148
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,479
slash result.txt and get all of your

149
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:41,680
custom information that was being stolen

150
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,600
by the bad guys and that was the game

151
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,759
right it worked pretty well

152
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,759
wasn't it terribly hard and it was

153
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,520
whack-a-mole again it wasn't automated

154
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,800
to this stage we didn't we were starting

155
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,639
to write some scripts but it was really

156
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,160
sort of manual processes about finding

157
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,680
site owners and asking them asking

158
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,120
nicely and being polite that sort of

159
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,960
stuff

160
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,120
it really really wasn't that hard and

161
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,479
then the bad guys figured out that we

162
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,000
were starting to get their text files

163
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,360
and they wrote basic stuff like this

164
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,120
which is a basic mailer script

165
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,880
right so all of a sudden the credentials

166
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,479
weren't being stored locally they were

167
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,800
being mailed off site right made it a

168
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,479
bit harder now you couldn't just get

169
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,680
them so now you have to start doing

170
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,520
things like reverse lookups and try and

171
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,720
figure out okay well i've spotted one

172
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,560
account that's been defrauded what other

173
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,720
accounts that i p log into and assume

174
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,000
that those are all compromises you know

175
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,320
just you know computer stuff basically

176
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,560
um but the crooks adapted and i started

177
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,320
to use captures and these sort of things

178
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,240
so at this time there was a real

179
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,840
business in takedowns because all these

180
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,440
companies out of america and um israel

181
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,960
et cetera were starting to see they can

182
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,160
make some money out of this because it's

183
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,080
starting to become a bit of a problem

184
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,280
because it's confidence in the channel

185
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,560
problem right

186
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,120
so then we move to five thousand dollars

187
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,880
per fraud event

188
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,880
fishing goes on a couple of years a

189
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,120
couple about you know about three three

190
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,639
years later two years later this thing

191
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,560
called rockfish comes along

192
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,680
hands up who knows what rockfish is

193
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,319
wow okay two people great

194
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,680
rockfish

195
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,520
was the bane of our existence at the

196
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,639
time

197
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,560
so rockfish was basically you took this

198
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,280
concept of a dumb fishing site that was

199
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,360
hosted on a compromised site

200
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,759
and you goosed it up on steroids

201
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,520
so all of a sudden you had not just one

202
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,440
brand and one fishing site you had

203
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,199
dozens of brands around the world and

204
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,639
multiple hundreds of fishing sites all

205
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:21,919
at once

206
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,680
now rockfish was the was the dawn of

207
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,360
this type of

208
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,039
i sort of want to say you know

209
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,280
industrialized fishing but you'd always

210
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,639
know that you're being rock fish because

211
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,120
the url would would be a long url slash

212
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,919
r r1 or slash rock and then your bank

213
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,280
brand right and genuinely as a little um

214
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,560
security analyst you'd see that come

215
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,680
through in the morning and you'd know

216
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,520
you're gonna have a really bad day

217
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,199
because what rockfish was also doing was

218
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,720
that industrialized the actual fishing

219
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,880
campaigns but they moved themselves to

220
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,240
one layer of

221
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,160
abstraction from the actual fishing

222
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,599
so rather than just taking down the

223
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,800
fishing site

224
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,319
even if you could get hands on that

225
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,639
first layer all you were getting was an

226
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,360
nginx proxy with an open vpn tunnel

227
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,479
because they'd move the actual

228
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,160
collection to one layer backwards

229
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,360
because they're figuring out how we were

230
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,759
going against them right um

231
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,120
so rarely you'd get anything other than

232
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,560
just those configs

233
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,360
and

234
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,639
as

235
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,080
responders who deal with this stuff a

236
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,280
lot i think everyone in this room would

237
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,759
understand that after a while you really

238
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,919
can infer a hell of a lot from an open

239
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,919
vpn config and an engine x config

240
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,280
because you have to

241
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,479
you've got nothing else to go on you're

242
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,160
just trying to sort of grasp at straws

243
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,280
of these little config things and try

244
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,000
and figure out where the

245
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,120
infrastructure's sitting and what it's

246
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,880
doing and who's connecting to what so

247
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,199
you sort of start to learn a lot a lot

248
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,880
about getting sort of inferences out of

249
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,560
not much data

250
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,240
but that moving to like a different

251
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,319
tiered setup really did hamper things so

252
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,400
now we're going after ip takedowns and

253
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,240
ip blocking because that's what you

254
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,000
could do you could get where that

255
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,919
initial phishing site was hosted and you

256
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,840
try and block that or take that down

257
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,280
from an ip layer because the domain was

258
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,120
gone and the actual collected

259
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,400
credentials were at an arm's length

260
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,878
backwards

261
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,879
then

262
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,720
we had this thing called

263
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,720
fast flux and avalanche

264
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,479
now i need to really you know

265
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,240
reiterate what i said before which was

266
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,400
this was early days right

267
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,720
now people these days look at fast flux

268
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,720
or also known as round robin dns and

269
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,800
they're like ah yeah cool that's just

270
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,440
it's called hosting these days but back

271
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,639
in these days it wasn't called hosting

272
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,639
it was called fast flux and the idea

273
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:21,520
being

274
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,039
if you look so remember we were going

275
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,560
after ip takedowns at this stage because

276
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,199
domain takedowns were gone and um

277
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,479
friendly site owners were gone so we're

278
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,400
now at ip takedowns

279
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,000
crooks say okay well you want to resolve

280
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,839
phishingsite.com

281
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,159
here's five ip addresses

282
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,120
uh university in brazil a dslrouter in

283
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,200
germany you know something in a hosting

284
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,559
provider in america something on

285
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,560
roadrunner and that's it a minute later

286
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,480
you resolve the same domain five new ip

287
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,600
addresses

288
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,959
because the domain is fluxing through

289
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,240
our p addresses now this is gonna be old

290
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,839
hatch over in this room but at the time

291
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,040
it was new

292
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,480
so then you're saying start to say okay

293
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,519
well

294
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,160
i can't take down this ip because it's

295
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,040
now on thousands of ip addresses every

296
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,720
time i look up to look up the domain to

297
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,600
try and do a takedown it's on a new five

298
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,839
five thousand six hundred thousand ip

299
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,560
addresses so okay well what if we killed

300
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,080
the domain sometimes we could get the

301
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,160
domain index domain right

302
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,959
well yes except you get this concept of

303
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,240
double flux

304
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,839
which is now the crooks aren't just

305
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,480
fluxing the actual hosting part of it

306
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,560
they're also fluxing the ns servers the

307
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,080
name servers

308
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,240
so you're trying to do takedowns on name

309
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,920
servers that are also fluxing through

310
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,279
these networks of hundreds of thousands

311
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,040
of computers around the world starts

312
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,480
getting interesting right

313
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,880
so i remember talked before about doing

314
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,680
take sorry doing detection based on well

315
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,320
what account did that ip log into and

316
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,519
let's work backwards and see what other

317
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,120
accounts that ip's logged into to try

318
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,800
and detect the fraud right

319
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,160
well now

320
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,320
you get triple fluxing

321
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,240
which is where they're also fluxing

322
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
the um the computers that they use to

323
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,399
log in to check the accounts

324
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,760
and all of these are behind this thing

325
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,399
which can be known as avalanche

326
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,680
now again hands up who knows what

327
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,040
avalanche is

328
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,399
was okay cool avalanche around 2006

329
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:07,839
avalanche really came into its own it

330
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,920
was the real first

331
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,320
bulletproof hosting on a commercial

332
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,000
scale like bulletproofing existed i'm

333
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,920
not saying this was the first ever but

334
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,680
for commercial crime

335
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,519
avalanche network was one of the first

336
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,360
real sort of uh commercial bulletproof

337
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,880
hosting providers because of the way it

338
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,680
was architected it was a network of i

339
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,720
think it's peak there's a couple of

340
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,160
hundred thousand different computers

341
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,240
around the world they're all dedicated

342
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,040
to

343
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,760
various parts of this fluxing stuff of

344
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,959
hosting criminal infrastructure or

345
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,959
acting as proxies or acting as name

346
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,240
servers or whatever you know parts of

347
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,079
the criminal landscape

348
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:42,959
and avalanche went on and on for i just

349
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,040
didn't saw myself

350
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,839
avalanche went on and until about 2016.

351
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,399
so avalanche was finally taken down 2016

352
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,240
genuinely and that i'd forgotten it

353
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,240
existed because i'd moved on but

354
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,680
avalanche stayed

355
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,200
and in 2016 they uh in ukraine kennedy

356
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,600
kapkanov who was the the last remaining

357
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,720
admin of avalanche was um raided by the

358
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:08,160
sbu swat or sbu special um soggies

359
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,959
basically but those are his guns he was

360
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:12,320
shooting back at the soggies as they

361
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,079
were coming through the front door um

362
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,279
and then he jumped over a fence and ran

363
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,600
down the road um interesting thing about

364
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,440
that is when he was brought up on

365
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,360
charges before a judge

366
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,360
apparently the judge just dismissed the

367
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,720
charges so apparently you can just shoot

368
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,800
at the cops and run a massive crime

369
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
network in the ukraine it's all fine

370
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,320
what i understand is that later on down

371
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,680
the track he was rearrested and

372
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,519
recharged and reconvicted from there but

373
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,040
at the time it was all a bit interesting

374
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,640
not that i'm saying anything i don't say

375
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,600
anything

376
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,279
but it was a little bit interesting so

377
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,440
but yeah so fast flux

378
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,519
and avalanche was a really big deal um

379
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:45,200
you know trying to do things like that

380
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,519
reverse lookups and and reverse checking

381
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,399
of fraudulent accounts became sort of

382
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,639
well useless basically and we started to

383
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,320
do things like you know injecting dummy

384
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,440
accounts that sort of stuff it wasn't

385
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,639
really sort of effective because

386
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,440
avalanche was big big time and avalanche

387
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,800
was around that five thousand dollars

388
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,120
per fraud event because as avalanche

389
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,120
would be successful and you had rockfish

390
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,880
on top of avalanche

391
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,480
there's really starting to be a very

392
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,399
very much of an industrialized fishing

393
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,760
infrastructure really starting to get

394
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,040
some money out

395
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,519
so then we move on to 50 grand per fraud

396
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,880
event

397
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,320
so 50 grand

398
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,720
is around 2007 2008

399
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,120
and to the bank of trojans

400
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,519
this that um yeah evgeny bogachev the

401
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,160
guy who wrote zeus um still on the on

402
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,279
the loose on the loose sorry still a

403
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,079
free man to this day but banker trojans

404
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,200
were

405
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,079
written

406
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:36,079
basically as a response to fishing

407
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:38,560
takedown stuff the idea was listen yeah

408
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,760
we've got this cool fishing

409
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:40,800
infrastructure we've got this cool

410
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,160
hosting infrastructure but things keep

411
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,079
getting taken down and we need to be a

412
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:46,320
bit more nimble about how we do this but

413
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,760
we realize we can make a lot of money

414
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,720
out of this this fraud stuff right so

415
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
um this guy and some others wrote things

416
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,680
called zeus bugatt net hell gauzy these

417
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,959
are things we call at the time banker

418
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,519
trojans or info stealing trojans so

419
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,680
these are basically the idea was rather

420
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,200
than a phishing email it was something

421
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,800
that you get infected with and it would

422
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,480
hook into your web browser

423
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,000
now i'm not going to go through too much

424
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
detail about that because who really

425
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,480
cares it's it it just works but i do

426
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,480
want to tell you a story about

427
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,680
one of the best one of the best web

428
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,920
injects i ever saw so

429
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,320
the idea of a bank of trojan is get on

430
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,160
your machine and hook into your web

431
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,959
browser right so then when you browse to

432
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:25,760
uh

433
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,760
uh the pund me when you browse to the

434
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,680
domain of a list of you know um

435
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:32,079
configured domains or whatever banks

436
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,399
it does an action now the action is

437
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,320
what's called a web inject and again

438
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,600
pardon me if i'm telling you how to suck

439
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,440
eggs but i want to tell you a story here

440
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,519
the web inject is the bit that as you

441
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,760
load up that bank's website it says okay

442
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,360
look through the code and at this point

443
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,360
in the code inject this

444
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,760
so the user's experience stays

445
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,279
lovely and the same they've got the

446
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,639
green padlock that we've all told them

447
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,639
to trust means good um and they're

448
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,160
loaded up and everything's fine right

449
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,000
but in there somewhere is the bad guy's

450
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,120
code it's called the web inject because

451
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,440
it's injecting itself right now the best

452
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,040
web injector ever saw

453
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,079
was

454
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:07,120
a web inject that basically sort of said

455
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:08,560
you logged into into your bank an

456
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,480
australian bank and it said

457
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,320
stop you've been given ten thousand

458
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,480
dollars by accident the aba says that

459
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,360
you have to give that ten thousand

460
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,199
dollars back or you can be charged with

461
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,560
whatever this is inside your bank's

462
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,600
website

463
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,920
okay cool first thing you do

464
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,320
transaction summary yep there it is last

465
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,519
night ten thousand bucks from this

466
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,680
account into my account second thing you

467
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,399
do

468
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,079
account balance yep my account balance

469
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,040
is ten thousand dollars more than it

470
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,079
should be

471
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,760
okay nice big red button comes up and

472
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,519
says give the money back or you can't do

473
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,199
anything else okay i'll give the money

474
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:37,920
back

475
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,920
right it populates it with the account

476
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:40,880
that was

477
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,560
that sent you the money and you send ten

478
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,399
thousand bucks to that account right

479
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:45,839
cool on with your date that's all

480
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:46,880
recorded in your transaction history

481
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,639
it's all it's all nice and neat

482
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:49,920
problem is

483
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,680
none of that was real

484
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,839
right none of that happened

485
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,920
but what has happened then is the punter

486
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,639
has just defrauded themselves

487
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,399
now the beauty of this is

488
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,760
well not beauty pardon either the

489
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,279
horrendous part of this

490
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,720
is that

491
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,040
no matter what control you put in place

492
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,880
no matter what hoop you put in place for

493
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,240
that punter to jump through to make that

494
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,920
transaction happen they're going to do

495
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,720
it

496
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,279
because they want to do the transaction

497
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,199
they have to do the transaction

498
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,120
you can do a two-factor token you can do

499
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,959
an sms message you can do a phone call

500
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,160
if you know all these sort of things you

501
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,519
can do but the punter wants to do it

502
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,120
so all of those controls you put in

503
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,920
basically get wounded null and void by

504
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,000
what is in essence a social engineering

505
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,040
trick

506
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,279
but then it gets even worse

507
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,720
those changes to your transaction

508
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,320
history and those changes to your bank

509
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,440
balance

510
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,199
persist

511
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,120
so as long as you're infected with

512
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,279
this this was actually citadel but as

513
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,440
long as infected with this version of a

514
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,000
zeus trojan that is doing it

515
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,079
it will persist those changes so you

516
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,600
will always think

517
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,040
you've got ten thousand dollars more

518
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,560
than you've got

519
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,320
until it comes time for you to buy that

520
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,800
car or that expensive fridge or whatever

521
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,079
and they say no you haven't got that

522
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,120
much money it's like yeah i do it's

523
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,199
right here and you actually gotta bid

524
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,480
you call your bank

525
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,079
or you know or your christmas paper

526
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:09,519
statement that transaction never

527
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,720
happened all you did was send ten

528
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,560
thousand dollars to someone

529
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,240
so that's and that that's just an idea

530
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,160
as to the power of these web injects and

531
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,600
why are we always they're they're the

532
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,279
warhead on the missile

533
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,600
like the actual malware itself

534
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,079
is just the fuel and the engine bit the

535
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,360
bit that does the damage is that little

536
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,360
bit of javascript a little bit of html

537
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,279
that's you know 40 50 lines long that's

538
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,360
what does the actual damage i'm very

539
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,880
hard to detect

540
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,240
right from a banking point of view very

541
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,440
hard to detect

542
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,880
because you have to now start doing

543
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,880
things like okay well what's in the dom

544
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,440
of the browser on the victim's edge you

545
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,519
know i know how much code i sent them to

546
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,440
render this banking site

547
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,639
but the only way that i can really tell

548
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,560
is by saying hey well hey

549
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,160
web browser at victim's end how much

550
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,839
code do you have and then compare the

551
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:52,800
lines

552
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,720
if there's a delta there maybe they're

553
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,720
being injected this is old stuff by the

554
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,480
way so this is you know this has got

555
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,680
better now i'm not sort of speaking out

556
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,800
at school but this is the thing that's

557
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,399
stuff to do right because these web

558
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,919
injects were massively around bad really

559
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:07,520
um yeah so we started doing this sort of

560
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,959
stuff um

561
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:10,319
that's bank of trojans but what we're

562
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,160
talking about now is yeah fraud events

563
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,240
around the 50 grand per pop

564
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,240
because they had complete control

565
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,160
and this is mostly retail banking mum

566
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,760
and dad banking moving a bit into

567
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,959
business banking because it's time to

568
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,240
see that there's some money there at

569
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,760
this stage we still had things like

570
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,760
daily limits and international transfer

571
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,760
restrictions all that sort of stuff um

572
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,360
but at this stage it was something a bit

573
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,679
new took totally took um fishing out of

574
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,240
the equation

575
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,799
so then

576
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,640
that worked really well

577
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,160
and that brought in this thing called

578
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,520
jabba zeus

579
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,919
again hands for jabba zeus anyone

580
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,039
a couple great same two guys

581
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,760
um java zeus basically took that whole

582
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,480
process and automated it

583
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,200
via using jabber xmpp he was using

584
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,679
instant messaging so these these crooks

585
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,440
have figured out we can sit there and we

586
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,440
don't have to make a decision

587
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,600
we can let it like the victim's computer

588
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,240
tell us hey i've got a sun corp victim

589
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,679
that's got 10 grand the account what do

590
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:08,720
you want to do

591
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,480
and using jabba they could say well you

592
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,240
know take five grand or take you know 2

593
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,320
500 bucks he's a mule that sort of stuff

594
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,600
so it really sort of automated that sort

595
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,240
of control of the fraud process

596
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,840
as it were and it was really really

597
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,840
really effective like jabba zeus was a

598
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,120
dirty word

599
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,200
for a lot of us at the time and jabba

600
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,000
zeus brought born this thing that is the

601
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,280
best tool that no one's ever heard of is

602
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,200
called leprechaun

603
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,679
leprechaun was an add-on to jabba zeus

604
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:34,720
and i'm telling you history lessons

605
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,679
because i want to sort of tell you how

606
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,919
these things kept i kept growing right

607
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,480
leprechaun add on to jabba zeus even

608
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,559
further automated it

609
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,400
leprechaun would get told a series of

610
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,160
parameters

611
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,360
and as

612
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,600
victims logged into websites

613
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,039
it would act on those parameters and

614
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:52,960
automatically make those transfers

615
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,039
parameters like daily limit you know

616
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,960
percentage of account balance

617
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,760
account type destination mule type that

618
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,840
sort of stuff was all automated

619
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,840
and leprechaun would just go yep cool so

620
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,320
and when jabez was really at its peak it

621
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,320
moved from uh do you want to commit

622
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,320
fraud to uh hey i've just committed

623
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,280
fraud

624
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,960
a learning model

625
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,160
which was really interesting for the

626
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,799
responders because you had no time now

627
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,160
because the because the the actual

628
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,840
crooks weren't doing the crime

629
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,200
leprechaun was doing the crime for them

630
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,520
just in just alerting them that hey i've

631
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,960
already stolen five grand for you or 50

632
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,080
grand for you it was a really

633
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,280
interesting time

634
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,000
so

635
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,200
that and ach's automatic clearinghouse

636
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,280
that's that's like the american term for

637
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,919
like automated transfers um so that led

638
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,480
to this operation called trident bridge

639
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,320
which triton bridge

640
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,320
did have impact they arrested a bunch of

641
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,679
people

642
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,840
but at the time the problem was when

643
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,280
we'd have these operations and you know

644
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,799
i was in law enforcement at the time

645
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,000
you'd have these operations they were

646
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,200
great that for a long time they were

647
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,400
really you know

648
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,360
hard to do genuinely but it would be

649
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,880
aussie mules

650
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,240
the money meals people actually would

651
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,000
cash out the money and give it to the

652
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,520
criminal city that's where you would

653
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,720
have impact

654
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,200
because money meals are stupid creatures

655
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,679
and i say that qualifiedly

656
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,760
so you would always get the mules in

657
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,039
this case you would also get the mule

658
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,159
handlers

659
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,760
funnily enough some of these dudes so

660
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,880
the one in the middle of the head and

661
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,080
this guy tank

662
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,600
they were involved way back at rockfish

663
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,760
so they were growing up with the crime

664
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,360
and they were growing up with us

665
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,520
reacting to them and generating new and

666
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,400
interesting ways to commit fraud in this

667
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,159
stage they were implicated as mule

668
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,200
handlers

669
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,280
so anyone who's ever been a mule or

670
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,440
handled mules knows that

671
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,360
handling mules is the hardest part

672
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,720
wrangling it's like hurting cats

673
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,400
literally trying to get these people to

674
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,919
make these transactions and be available

675
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,679
to accept this money and cash that's the

676
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:45,919
hardest part so that's really

677
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,600
time

678
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,679
takes a lot of time to do it so

679
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,120
at this stage these guys were doing the

680
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,120
mule handling stuff um and yeah it was

681
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,480
always mules and it was meals that got

682
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,559
arrested but it was still good work it

683
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,720
was tremendous work because jabez was

684
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,840
massively bad for

685
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,039
everyone then move on to five hundred

686
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,039
thousand dollars per fraud event

687
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,320
so now we're getting a bit more modern

688
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,159
times right

689
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,600
this thing called game over zeus and

690
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,159
this thing called called dire come along

691
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,720
and game over zeus was wicked it was

692
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,799
again it was the evolution of all of the

693
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,400
stuff we've seen before

694
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,039
into this almost perfect fraud tool

695
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,120
called game over zeus and at the same

696
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,000
time this thing called dire emerged now

697
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,480
why i mention these things is because

698
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,840
they've taken all of the tricks about

699
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,840
being fully automated and that had this

700
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,159
really really robust and really

701
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:36,000
well-matured muelling infrastructure

702
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,360
because as i said it's hard to do

703
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,559
muelling but

704
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,320
now you're talking about actual money

705
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,400
laundering like as in money laundering

706
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,480
syndicates that launder money for drugs

707
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,080
for prostitution for all kinds of crime

708
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,760
they just you just pour money into them

709
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,600
at this end and money comes out that end

710
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,640
and it goes through all these things in

711
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,880
the middle but they take a lot of

712
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,080
percentage

713
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,520
and it takes a while to get in you know

714
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:57,039
to get into these people so once they

715
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,280
got into cahoots the the floodgates are

716
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,640
open now it's just about how much money

717
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,039
can i pump through these networks

718
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:03,760
so

719
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,520
we shift as attackers we've got all

720
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,960
these cool tools and cool tricks we've

721
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,360
learnt but now we shift from retail

722
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,880
banking

723
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,960
now i'm going after business banking

724
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,960
i'm going after wealth management

725
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,559
i'm going to have to self-manage super

726
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:18,799
funds in australia i'm going after where

727
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,640
there's some real freaking money

728
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,720
because i've got all this back end set

729
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,240
up now to pump this money through i just

730
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,320
need more of it coming in so at this

731
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,000
stage when game over zeus and i were

732
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,080
really pumping and i did a lot of work

733
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,919
on these things at the time

734
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,080
they weren't even caring about retail

735
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,120
banking accounts they weren't caring

736
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,640
about you or my bank account it was only

737
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,159
the top end of town because they were

738
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:39,840
set up to be able to move that large

739
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,760
amounts of money and when they did it

740
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,159
they really really did it

741
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:45,600
so being hooked in with these

742
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,679
professional mule crews as i said it

743
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,520
took away that bottleneck

744
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,640
because the mule's always the hardest

745
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,400
bit actually getting

746
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:55,120
that 50 grand in your back pocket is the

747
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,919
hardest part of cybercrime

748
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:01,039
getting access to it is the easiest part

749
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,400
transferring it's pretty easy as well

750
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,480
but actually getting it in the skyrocket

751
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,320
is the hardest part of this but but at

752
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,520
this stage these people were really

753
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,559
hooked in

754
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,880
um and it was it was you know wild times

755
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,640
and it would just be churning through it

756
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,520
and if you ever gone to uh not i'm not

757
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,360
bashing them at all but you go to

758
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,120
certain industries around let's say

759
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,600
superannuation etc and you say hey bad

760
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,280
guys have just transferred 500 grand out

761
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,039
and they say that's impossible and it's

762
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,159
like well

763
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,520
it happened

764
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,840
um and they say well we can't that's not

765
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,440
possible so well the crooks figured out

766
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,640
how to do it so now you've got to give

767
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,320
someone all their super back um those

768
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,080
are really hard conversations to have

769
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,600
because especially in superannuation and

770
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,120
hopefully it's better now i'm sure it is

771
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,400
because more transactions these days but

772
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,360
at that stage super was very static

773
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,760
it didn't move much you didn't really

774
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,760
change a lot about it money sort of sat

775
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,640
there

776
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,799
um so over years these systems never

777
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,799
really grew or changed but the bad guys

778
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,080
would grow and change and would figure

779
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,679
out where the money sat and go after it

780
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,000
so it was interesting time for that in

781
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,840
that sort of scenario but game over zeus

782
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,159
was wild now

783
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,400
with q works and some others contributed

784
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,640
to taking down game over zeus

785
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,080
and when so this actually it's a really

786
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,520
decent read this is before my time with

787
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,000
the company but it's a decent read um

788
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,360
is around

789
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,520
when we did game over zeus

790
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,880
it was the same guy getting to keep kind

791
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,200
of the guy with the cat um but it was

792
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,400
also he was writing this thing called

793
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,240
crypto locker

794
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,440
and that's interesting what's crypto

795
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,200
remember this is 2014 right so this is

796
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,039
before real ransomware was really a

797
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,640
thing it was like all right crypto is

798
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,720
interesting that's fine um

799
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,720
so now i've got time and i was going to

800
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,240
tell you a story about 500 million

801
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,640
dollars but i won't but it does involve

802
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,880
a meteorite and a challenge coin ask me

803
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,000
at the bar later i'll tell you that

804
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,679
story um but i'm running out of time um

805
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:44,960
so

806
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,440
we now move to now

807
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,120
where we are now is five million dollars

808
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,840
per fraud event or per loss event

809
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,520
and five million dollars per loss event

810
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,240
is

811
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,840
ransomware

812
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,520
right so this is you know you can see

813
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,120
sort of how these things go forward but

814
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,039
this is where

815
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,679
um uh pardon me uh bogachev got to with

816
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,960
writing cryptolocker he'd seen

817
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,400
the banks were getting better at well

818
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,840
sorry we're very good at defending banks

819
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,760
spent a lot of money on defense right

820
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,520
banks are some of the hardest targets to

821
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,720
actually do

822
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,480
but what these crooks have figured out

823
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,480
over their time is

824
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,240
let's take the take the bank out of the

825
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,919
equation

826
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,600
let's make this a personal transaction

827
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,520
between me and the victim

828
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,679
because as i'm sure the consultants in

829
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,520
the room know a lot of companies don't

830
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,600
spend a lot of time on security

831
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,600
but if me as the attacker can take the

832
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,279
highly secured part about it out of the

833
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,039
equation and the insured part about it

834
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,480
the bank's money is insured if i can

835
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,159
take that out of the equation

836
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,919
i can do one-on-one with the victim and

837
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:43,679
i'm going to really cash out

838
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,760
so that's where we are now

839
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,000
is the crooks have decided i want to go

840
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,360
one-on-one with the victim i'm going to

841
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,799
mug them in the street for 5 million

842
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,799
bucks and it works as we're all seeing

843
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,480
it works it's not going anywhere and

844
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,559
it's never going to stop so what's

845
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:57,760
really also interesting there is it's

846
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,440
taken that that part of the equation out

847
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,520
of it which is the money mules

848
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,080
i now no longer need to give 15 to that

849
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,240
money laundering syndicate

850
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,840
because i can just get it all myself by

851
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,320
cryptocurrency so it's almost like it's

852
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,120
it's

853
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,679
it's the evolution of criminality to you

854
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,200
know millennial status where you've

855
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,400
taken all the large infrastructure out

856
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,080
of the equation you're going one-on-one

857
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,440
and using cryptocurrencies so it really

858
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,960
has taken all those bars of entry out of

859
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,840
it which is why it's happening

860
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,600
everywhere

861
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,880
but

862
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,200
new and cool old and dumb still works

863
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,880
right like fishing still works it still

864
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,440
happens day to day um so the future and

865
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,240
this is where i sort of wanted to get

866
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,440
through real quick

867
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,440
is

868
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,159
i'm

869
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,120
a minute and a half um mobile devices

870
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,480
are interesting

871
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,440
because

872
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,159
the tools to do mobile device

873
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,080
bank theft and information theft have

874
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,080
existed for years you remember when

875
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,440
michael hippenham sort of stood up and

876
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,960
said mobile malware's gonna be the next

877
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,000
big thing and everyone panicked and it

878
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,440
never really happened

879
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,880
well that's sort of what's what we're

880
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,240
seeing bearing out now so we had this

881
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,000
thing called marcher marcher was great

882
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,679
it was a fully featured basically a bank

883
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,000
of trojan for your phone cool it came

884
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
didn't do a whole lot sort of went then

885
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,600
you had this thing called exobot then

886
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,880
anubis

887
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,159
sort of the same thing like really

888
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,159
really full-featured mobile banking

889
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,360
malware platforms never really took off

890
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,960
but now you have everyone's favorite flu

891
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,080
bot

892
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,320
which is taking off flu box cmc where

893
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,279
they sort of got to the point where

894
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:23,039
they're really making that sort of um

895
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,559
all the parts coalesce

896
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,000
as it were and this is getting involved

897
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,279
in the old school money laundering

898
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,039
syndicates as well so you have these

899
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,799
changes throughout through mobile

900
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:33,520
devices now i genuinely think we've all

901
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,480
seen

902
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:38,080
bits and sus used to push out malware to

903
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,240
corporate networks right we've all seen

904
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,440
that happen

905
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,440
well mobile device fleet management

906
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,360
software is just the same

907
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,520
so in my mind that's where i'd be going

908
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,440
i'd be locking up an entire fleet for

909
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,440
you know like imagine our mining

910
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,880
companies entire fleet of handsets get

911
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,399
locked up overnight

912
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,559
the technology exists to do this

913
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,559
they just haven't done it yet

914
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,000
i've got anything to sell you to do that

915
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,960
i'm just saying that's what's going to

916
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,960
happen next that's where i'd go um i'd

917
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,799
look at these you know these large-scale

918
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,640
deployment things and

919
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,679
generally

920
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:08,799
i did have more but i'm running out of

921
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,000
time so i did what sort of just want to

922
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,039
say like

923
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,399
are we winning

924
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,760
well it depends on your definition of

925
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,120
win

926
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,559
you know like do we think we're going to

927
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,399
win the war on drugs

928
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,240
do we think we're going to win the war

929
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,760
on illegal guns

930
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,200
no but we as an industry seem to have

931
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,200
this hubris that sort of says well we

932
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,960
surely we can beat this

933
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,080
we're smart enough we've got all this

934
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,320
money surely we can beat cybercrime it's

935
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,159
like well why

936
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:33,520
we can have wins and we can have

937
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,919
successes and we can make a difference

938
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:37,440
but i think everyone in this room would

939
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,919
know this isn't going to go anywhere

940
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:41,039
but we just had a little bit of fun

941
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,279
while trying to do it i think because

942
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,279
it's one of those things where i don't

943
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,120
think we can win we can't beat this but

944
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,480
we can definitely have an impact on it

945
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,640
and it's worthwhile um but i think yeah

946
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,080
we need to sort of stop using that sort

947
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,240
of terminology um so yeah with that

948
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,840
thank you for your time it's a bit of a

949
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,720
downer to start the day on um but it is

950
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,559
also reality so yeah thanks for your

951
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:02,960
time um any questions around our time

952
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,240
i'm getting the hook i think

953
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,520
unfortunately we're out of time it looks

954
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:07,200
um but on behalf of all certain

955
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,559
conference um thank you very much john

lesson and

958
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,039
ground and reality of where we're going

959
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,360
um the next session in this room is um

960
