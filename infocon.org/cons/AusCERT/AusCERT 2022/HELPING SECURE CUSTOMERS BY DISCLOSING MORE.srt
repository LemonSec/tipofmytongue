1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,600
uh hello everyone so the next speaker is

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,319
kyle jackson kyle's from octopus deploy

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,759
where he's in the product security

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,360
instant response team

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,559
and today he's going to talk about how

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,200
to secure customers by disclosing more

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,919
so please welcome kyle

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,400
um so kyle jackson octopus deploy um

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,880
security operations team lead

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,439
my role is varied it's internal security

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,120
response product security response it's

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,880
a whole lot of different things um

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,800
contact details are all there

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,120
i don't use twitter so you can say that

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:40,719
this is a terrible presentation and i'll

16
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,399
be blissfully ignorant the whole time

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,640
and that's cool so no problems at all

18
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,239
but feel free

19
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:48,160
any three of those no problems at all

20
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,680
i'm also around i'm probably one of the

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,440
few people with lots of tattoos so

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,280
pretty easy to pick out of the crowd i'm

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,360
sure there's a couple others there but

24
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,000
not too hard to find

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,280
so essentially

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,480
why do we disclose vulnerabilities

27
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,680
software and abilities and this is

28
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,520
coming from the premise of a software

29
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,080
vendor or an open source maintainer

30
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,200
and i'll get a little backstory about

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,680
this is why this is a presentation

32
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,040
so about

33
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,680
i started doctor's deploy in 2020 over

34
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,400
the christmas break in 2020 to 2021 we

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,000
essentially had a security researcher

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,759
from a public

37
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:21,920
research company since she'd say hey

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,360
trying to run ability and product it was

39
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,479
a local privilege escalation

40
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,000
vulnerability and they're like we're

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,360
going to disclose it publicly just so

42
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,200
you know you've got 90 days

43
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,880
now at the time that's fine we're doing

44
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,640
cve ids we're like this is great we're

45
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,200
totally fine

46
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,040
but we're like how do we sort of do this

47
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,799
better because fundamentally they're

48
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,079
going to go and write a blog post and

49
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,840
say hey we found a thing we're just

50
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,759
going to have a cve id it's not really

51
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,479
nice what do we do so this started sort

52
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:47,759
of the mad rush at this sort of

53
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,280
two-month mark to say well how do we

54
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,560
actually create this

55
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,920
the hardest part of this whole process

56
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,439
was trying to figure out what do you

57
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,280
actually do um

58
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,880
you google this stuff you find a lot of

59
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,240
great things trying to like alaska have

60
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,840
really good stuff there but no one has

61
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,200
like a step by step this is how you

62
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,200
actually do the thing it's very hard to

63
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,159
sort of

64
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,960
figure it out so the main reason helps

65
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,318
ensure your customers stay secure that's

66
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,840
the core fundamental reason why you

67
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,319
disclose them

68
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,080
simple as that really

69
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,440
why don't people disclose them and

70
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,879
that's probably the more complex story

71
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,040
of this really so

72
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,640
core one our product may be exploited if

73
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,040
we publicly disclose look once you

74
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,040
disclose it yes it could be that is a

75
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,680
very valid point um you would hope your

76
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,879
customer your communication your

77
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,000
customers is

78
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,680
sort of strong enough that they patch

79
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,360
quick enough and that they can secure

80
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,879
their systems but

81
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,080
at the same time if you don't tell them

82
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,040
anyway

83
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,720
there's a good chance we'll be exploited

84
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,959
irrespective of the fact so it's kind of

85
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,920
a moot point at that level

86
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,360
our customers can't easily patch their

87
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,640
environments or they don't patch their

88
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,319
environment so that's a that's a good

89
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,000
one i mean most people here have

90
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,080
probably worked on exchange server maybe

91
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,519
and has the horrors are sitting there

92
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,640
trying to do an exchange server patch

93
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,920
and going i hope this doesn't explode in

94
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,280
my face at 10 o'clock at night and i

95
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,239
spend the entire night rebuilding it

96
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,239
yeah it's valid but it's also not valid

97
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,360
because if they don't patch they can't

98
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,280
update et cetera

99
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,879
um we'll get bad press be topical about

100
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,400
software vulnerabilities in our product

101
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,319
um you'll get equally bad press if you

102
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,760
don't tell them about software run

103
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,840
losing products um it's

104
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,080
it's always better to be open honest and

105
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,840
that way you can sort of go past all

106
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,440
this stuff

107
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,040
and disclose isn't something the

108
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,800
business has thought about

109
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,120
that's probably more the reality of it

110
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,879
say software startups is a prime example

111
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,480
we just build products you go to market

112
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,519
and you don't think about well how do

113
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,799
you disclose the thing what do you do

114
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,360
about that

115
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,799
and so what are the ways that stuff run

116
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,480
blues are currently disclosed the core

117
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,040
ones are you'll see a cv id will pop up

118
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,280
and that's pretty valid that works

119
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,840
security advisory security bulletins

120
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,120
pick your different flavor and name for

121
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,959
those are also the same thing

122
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,040
you'll also get the sneaky github repo

123
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,799
which gets posted for two hours and then

124
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,319
pulled down and everyone just mad rush

125
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,519
to try and figure out what it was and

126
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,239
then you know that's also very fun

127
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,840
hasn't happened to us yet which is

128
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,080
good so if you can disclose those way

129
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,360
how do you start disclosing that's the

130
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,879
hardest part like how do you actually go

131
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,519
ahead and start doing this um

132
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:08,879
really it's helping change your business

133
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,799
to embrace disclosing it it was a great

134
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,560
presentation about the bug banter

135
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,480
programs because a lot of those sort of

136
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,399
fell back into this presentation as well

137
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,279
um

138
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,478
work closely with the development team

139
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,120
it's going to impact them exponentially

140
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,479
not in the fact that you're disclosing

141
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,400
it but the fact that there's going to be

142
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,919
timelines involved there's going to be a

143
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,040
lot of pressure on them to say you've

144
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,240
got to patch these things to do these

145
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,120
things it sort of has to happen

146
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,160
um

147
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,840
no blame cultural software vulnerability

148
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,600
point of view we're all humans so

149
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,360
there's a

150
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,120
there's a bit of a thing when we sit in

151
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,080
our company where there's might be

152
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,120
vulnerability it might be a sql

153
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,440
injection and software devs will take it

154
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,720
personally that

155
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,240
they've accidentally made that mistake

156
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,680
and it's very key to make sure that

157
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,280
they're not to blame for what they've

158
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,880
done like it's a mistake with humans we

159
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,479
build humans build these things not

160
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:53,919
machines so

161
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:55,680
there needs to be a culture around no

162
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,120
one's going to be stood in front of you

163
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,400
know a board of managers and say why did

164
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,120
you make that mistake

165
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,720
bug bounty programs is also a good way

166
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,000
to sort of

167
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,440
start this whole process because you've

168
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,680
already taken those vulnerabilities in

169
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,800
you can kind of start the whole

170
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,919
disclosure process from that point of

171
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:12,800
view so

172
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,560
we as a company we

173
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,320
already had a bug bounty program running

174
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,160
prior to doing all this so it kind of

175
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,440
made a little bit easier to go down that

176
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,800
path

177
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,479
management buying is buying is sort of

178
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,560
the last key thing it has to be a thing

179
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,600
you can't just start disclosing

180
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,360
vulnerabilities and management are like

181
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,240
oh what are you doing this is great um

182
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,680
the cool thing is collaboration if

183
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,960
you're not collaborating with the teams

184
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,240
you're not going to be successful it's

185
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,280
not going to be a good experience for

186
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,400
anyone involved

187
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,880
vdps you need to have one

188
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,720
really got to have one um i'm not going

189
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,080
to explain how to do it because probably

190
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,759
the right person to explain how to do it

191
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:48,240
um great thing on owasp there also

192
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,680
pressurization has some good ideas there

193
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,840
and what to do but bdp is are pretty key

194
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,960
it's good to have them but how to

195
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,520
disclose them as well

196
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,800
i threw these slidings i was like i

197
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,639
should probably like say what a cv id is

198
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,479
just before i get into like sort of the

199
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,560
nuts and bolts of disclosing um

200
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,080
vulnerabilities and exposures it's a

201
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,680
database of vulnerabilities that's

202
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,160
pretty much it um nothing super special

203
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,280
there

204
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,960
the tricky part with when you're

205
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,680
disclosing vulnerabilities is this part

206
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,080
is when to actually assign the cv cpu id

207
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,840
this is probably the hardest part that i

208
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,120
guess some people sort of grasp when

209
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,440
they're doing it so you've got your

210
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:24,240
vulnerability is unique to your software

211
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,520
and that's cool

212
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,080
you assign a cv id nice and easy nothing

213
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,479
crazy out of there

214
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,759
but if there's a vulnerability in a

215
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,120
third-party dependency which essentially

216
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,240
your software inherits that

217
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,639
vulnerability and is that vulnerability

218
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,479
you don't go and assign a new cpu id you

219
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,400
reference the third party so that's the

220
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,080
complexity on that one is like where do

221
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,199
you reference what do you actually do so

222
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,120
that was one that i think even my team

223
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
now still asks like where do we actually

224
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,199
what is the cv id for this vulnerability

225
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,440
and it's like well where does this exist

226
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,520
whose vulnerability is this

227
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,720
and a bit of process to actually break

228
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,120
that down

229
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,479
and so this is even the trickier

230
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,160
question is what about your sas platform

231
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,240
so we run a sas platform um and we've

232
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,000
had this question a lot of times is

233
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,759
do you disclose my abilities in a sas

234
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,000
platform short answer is no long answer

235
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,800
is

236
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,440
potentially maybe it depends um

237
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,440
so generally speaking from our

238
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,960
disclosure point of view we disclose

239
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,199
things that the customers can actually

240
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,639
you know they install software they can

241
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,319
update it they can do something about it

242
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,000
the sas platform moves so quick it's

243
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,759
kind of hard to actually disclose and i

244
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:28,880
think there's a current problem in the

245
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,639
industry itself about how do you

246
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,479
disclose runabilities

247
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,520
in a sas platform so to speak

248
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,840
the long answer of maybe is well if the

249
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,440
vulnerability itself there's something

250
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,880
that customers can do to actually

251
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,880
resolve that vulnerability

252
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:44,879
then perhaps you disclose it at some

253
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,680
level but we have not gone there yet and

254
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,280
if we do get there i'll surely do a talk

255
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,319
on that one because that would be an

256
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,479
interesting one

257
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,639
so requesting cvu ids

258
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,840
this is all changed because there's a

259
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,440
lot of changes coming in the whole cv id

260
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,440
process but

261
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,440
i'll get to the cna non-cna thing in a

262
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,759
second um but bottom line is if you're a

263
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:05,759
software developer or open source and

264
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,759
you've just started you can just do web

265
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,759
requests and say i need a cvu id here's

266
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,000
my vulnerability here's the details

267
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,360
please and thank you

268
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,039
at some point over the next period of

269
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,199
time they'll publish that and

270
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,639
that is it pretty much

271
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,400
if you're a cna there's a few little

272
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,919
extra fun stuff that happens there and

273
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,800
we'll get into that one in a second

274
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,879
so a cna is essentially a cve numbering

275
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,560
authority so

276
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,759
you're essentially allowed to assign

277
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,159
your own cv ids for a scope of products

278
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,958
that you control so um

279
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,799
for example if twice deploy is a cna

280
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,958
atlassian is a cna a bunch of other cnas

281
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,000
exist

282
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,279
there's a lot of

283
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:42,479
certs around the world they're actually

284
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,800
cnas themselves and the sort of process

285
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,040
there is very complicated but long story

286
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,399
short we can assign ideas for ourselves

287
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,279
it also allows if say researchers find

288
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,120
vulnerability in our product or one of

289
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,640
our products and they go

290
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,240
we're going to assign a cpu id they kind

291
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,480
of can't because they go well octopus

292
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,640
deploy other cna they assign the cv ids

293
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,920
you go speak to them and they will

294
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,680
actually get that sorted so it kind of

295
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,120
forces the vulnerabilities to come to us

296
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,480
and say we know about all the

297
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,600
vulnerabilities

298
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,120
that we think we know of and we can

299
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,320
essentially deal with the disclosure

300
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,800
from that point of view

301
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,640
so becoming a cv numbering authority

302
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,720
that's an interesting process um

303
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,920
you have to have a really disclosure

304
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,000
policy that's just key and you have to

305
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,680
have a place where you can essentially

306
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,000
disclose vulnerabilities so

307
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,399
website is the only place really so a

308
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,080
website to have them

309
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,440
i won't go into much detail about the

310
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,680
process bottom line is there there is an

311
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,279
exam in there

312
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,800
i did it at five o'clock in the morning

313
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,560
brisbane time i would not recommend it

314
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,720
was not very fun

315
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,480
thoroughly yeah just

316
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,680
no

317
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,519
um

318
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,720
so this sort of goes through a bit of

319
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,080
the process of like how do you request

320
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,480
it requesting cv ids via web request

321
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,399
it's very very simple it's just a

322
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,399
process of select your request types you

323
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:55,839
know report vulnerability watch your

324
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,920
email address fill out some details and

325
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,880
that's kind of it that's what you really

326
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,839
have to do technically um

327
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,200
it's not super great because you're not

328
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,560
really saying what you're doing you're

329
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,800
just like hey here's a cpu idea id great

330
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,160
success

331
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,560
whereas the sort of continued version is

332
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,000
well you can add extra details you can

333
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,680
add you know attack vectors descriptions

334
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,279
yada yada yada you can add all that

335
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,120
detail um

336
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,720
the web requests are reviewed by miter

337
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,560
themselves so there is a delay in like

338
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,480
what they can do to actually get some

339
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,160
how quick they can get to them but it

340
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,360
does work

341
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,000
pretty valid process um pros of it it's

342
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,680
easy process doesn't require much you

343
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,120
know you just fill out a web form and go

344
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,720
submit thanks very much

345
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,760
you don't get a lot of control of the

346
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,680
submission process and review requests

347
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,279
do take time so that's sort of the

348
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,880
trade-off but it's easy

349
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,040
now if you get to become a cna which is

350
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,200
again if you're a software vendor it's

351
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,720
highly recommended to be a cna you can

352
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,160
have a there's a lot of control over how

353
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,000
you do things um

354
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,640
you get to actually go and request

355
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,560
your own cpu ids now this is using

356
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,399
something that might have called cbe

357
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,880
services that's their new

358
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,959
you know really cool api that does a

359
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,040
bunch of things um and that sort of

360
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,000
screenshot the bottom there is

361
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,240
essentially a c um a program i've

362
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,399
written to reserve them for my team so

363
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,680
you can just that was actually yesterday

364
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,760
that's not a real that is a real cv id

365
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,200
it's not ours we're not red hat that's a

366
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,640
test environment so don't stress we're

367
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,320
not doing anything weird there but you

368
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,839
can essentially reserve them on the fly

369
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,240
whenever you want them um nice and easy

370
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,880
no problems at all

371
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,880
so once you've sort of got the cv id

372
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,440
sorted beside you've organized the cv id

373
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,040
by the way in the web request you don't

374
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,399
have to fill out the details straight

375
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,399
away you can just assign the id and say

376
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,000
give me an id i'll send you details

377
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,920
later that's totally fine as well

378
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,839
then you get into sort of like what are

379
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,040
the components of the vulnerability

380
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:41,120
disclosure and this is the key part and

381
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,079
i think this is the part a lot of

382
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,160
vendors miss and it causes a lot of pain

383
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,040
essentially like because we're a

384
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,640
security team ourselves

385
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,160
we have internal security functions we

386
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,120
have to care about as well as our

387
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,880
product security so

388
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,639
we've got a lot of tools that look for

389
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,760
these vulnerabilities and we get stuff

390
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,360
and we go like hey vulnerability and x

391
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,279
program and it just goes like

392
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,040
i don't know

393
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,560
local proof escalation we're like well

394
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,000
what does this do what's the details

395
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,920
here we don't know

396
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,200
so

397
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,560
first part is one of the details and

398
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,000
this is really key

399
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,839
there's options here for how you do this

400
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,160
um option one totally valid are these

401
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,440
are real uh

402
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,880
option two is actually what we really

403
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,399
was what we actually wrote in this

404
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,240
vulnerability um so this was a sql

405
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,519
injection really last year in our

406
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,519
product justin stephen found it via bug

407
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,639
crowd program um so option one

408
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,360
look it it works it's not super great

409
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,440
because as a security team it's kind of

410
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,200
like well what's the impact how does

411
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,120
this work like what is the core part of

412
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:33,839
this

413
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,680
um

414
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,079
option three is super not ideal um you

415
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:39,600
do not want to be going explaining how

416
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,440
you actually exploit the vulnerability

417
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,279
so it's really find this middle ground

418
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,880
of here's enough information for a

419
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,800
security team to feel like they know

420
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,639
enough to stick to sort of protect

421
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,000
themselves or know the risk in the

422
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,600
environment but not enough that you're

423
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,360
saying to every threat actor hey by the

424
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,760
way here's the poc plus the code and you

425
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,160
know have fun

426
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,920
so that's essentially what we wrote now

427
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,440
vulnerability for this one

428
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:05,200
it was option two very straightforward

429
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,720
and then in practice software versions

430
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,079
it's nothing worse than going what does

431
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,680
it actually impact because sometimes

432
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,279
it's not just like hey it's all software

433
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,279
versions back it has to be what's the

434
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,200
actual range of the versions

435
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,560
um

436
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,320
for us it's essentially how we do it so

437
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,519
the same screenshot out of our thing

438
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,279
we're talking about details and then we

439
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,120
go into a versions of affected and

440
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,639
that's where you list out the versions

441
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,240
essentially from where

442
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,240
where to next and then you know it's

443
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,000
pretty straightforward so there's a nice

444
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,360
little table further down in our

445
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,880
disclosures where you can sort of map

446
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,399
out what you're on and what you need to

447
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,440
go to

448
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,120
but essentially the premise is allowing

449
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,880
people to

450
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,040
be able to find out really quickly

451
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,360
mitigation super important so

452
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,360
this is why what it being a cna doing

453
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,560
your own advisor is very important

454
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,760
because you have the ability to add a

455
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,199
lot of extra context which you really

456
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,320
can't do

457
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,680
through like a general web request type

458
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,519
scenario and you can't really control

459
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,199
how you sort of present that so

460
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,120
mitigation is super key

461
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,720
it's really important that if you do

462
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,160
have a mitigation

463
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,360
put the information there on how to

464
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,399
mitigate it

465
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,639
plus add in information about what the

466
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,079
side effect of mitigation is there's

467
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,360
always some side effect of the

468
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,760
mitigation usually um

469
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,199
and what actually information can they

470
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,760
use with that mitigation so here's one

471
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:14,959
here

472
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,320
from that same vulnerability so the

473
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,440
first sort of blue section is

474
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,680
essentially saying you can go and turn

475
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,480
off the event view functionality

476
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,600
totally fine and mitigate

477
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,880
surroundability

478
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,120
the oranges however if you do this

479
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,560
you're going to get some ui errors

480
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,800
things aren't going to be super great

481
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,720
it's still usable but there's some

482
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,399
caveats and then the green is well

483
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,920
here's some extra details about how it

484
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,440
all works if you need to know some more

485
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,480
stuff so

486
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,920
from that vulnerability itself we're

487
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,600
able to say look if you can't patch for

488
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,920
whatever reason you can do this but

489
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,519
here's the caveats of that thing

490
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,639
and the exploitation public

491
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,240
announcements and source it's always

492
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,680
good to

493
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,040
tell your customers if you know of

494
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,800
exploitations it's very important

495
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,000
especially that part public

496
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,360
announcements is good especially doing

497
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,600
um sort of coordinated disclosure so if

498
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,639
you've got a security researcher

499
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,959
disclosing and you're also disclosing

500
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,320
it's good to have those two packed

501
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,600
together and then who found the

502
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,040
vulnerability that's always just that's

503
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,160
nice it has to be there um

504
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,279
and then that's the one from that

505
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,959
vulnerability as well so that was found

506
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,880
by justin stephen and

507
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,920
yeah that was quite interesting one

508
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,920
actually that was a saturday afternoon

509
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,279
vulnerability and that was very

510
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,680
stressful but that's fine so i did have

511
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,720
a link here to show what it should look

512
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,040
like in the end but um my bad on the

513
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,800
presentation side so if you want to see

514
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,959
those you can go to that url

515
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,079
you can find all i wanna lose there i

516
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:32,240
think one went up yesterday so

517
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,279
totally fine have a look that's all

518
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,040
public

519
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,320
you shouldn't end up with something like

520
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
this i redacted who it was because for

521
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,440
reasons but that is just less than ideal

522
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,199
that that person is that company is a

523
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,240
cna they are functioning as a cna um

524
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,240
it provides no function details as to

525
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,680
what you actually do they just say like

526
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,759
here's runability congrats and they

527
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,199
don't give you anything else with that

528
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,320
so you have no ability to actually

529
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,920
understand what the impact is you sort

530
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,360
of take it at face value and go well i

531
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,000
hope it's not bad

532
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,759
so try to avoid that scenario if we can

533
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,120
and then so we've sort of gone through

534
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,199
the process of you can assign cve ids

535
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,040
you can do that we've also gone on the

536
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,399
process of

537
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,759
you know what's how do you sort of pack

538
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,160
together a disclosure itself and then

539
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,680
we're looking at tools that you can use

540
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,079
to publish um this is sort of the i've

541
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,759
gone less i'll try to go as less as i

542
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,240
can just to avoid the complexities it

543
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,800
can be very simple though um

544
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,639
but we'll start with submitting cv ids

545
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,000
so

546
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,519
for those who don't know so if you're

547
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,519
not a cna web request is the way to go

548
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,759
if you're a cna at the moment github so

549
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,440
that github url i don't know if people

550
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,199
know that is the entire cv list since

551
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:41,759
1999 plus up to now um that is updated

552
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,720
all the time there is 35 000 branches on

553
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,480
a check last night and there's pr's

554
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,519
every day that has every single cv list

555
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,199
colby who's speaking later today he

556
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,720
wrote some really cool stuff internally

557
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,480
for us that actually scrapes this every

558
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,639
couple every hour or so looks for new

559
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,959
vendors that we have to find their cvs

560
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,199
that they're releasing so super handy

561
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,360
it's not super publicly known but it is

562
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,359
there

563
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,720
i think one day it's going to go away

564
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,640
but i don't know don't quote me on that

565
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,000
but at the moment it's super great

566
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,559
source of information

567
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,079
what is changing though at the moment if

568
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,919
you are a cna is that you can go and

569
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,919
submit via apis and this is sort of that

570
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,760
extra functionality that's coming in so

571
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,880
it's not currently released

572
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,400
you can go to github repo and have a

573
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,319
look at it that cbu services is the open

574
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,880
source public repository for mitre cpu

575
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,080
services

576
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,000
i do a bit of work on it on the odd

577
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,840
occasion um so if you really want to

578
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,600
know the

579
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,559
the guts of that whole software project

580
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,840
buy me a beer and we'll talk about it

581
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,000
tonight because it's interesting but

582
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,919
anyway i'll leave that as it is

583
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:44,960
um

584
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,400
one thing we found was interesting is

585
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,200
that we actually went and um when we did

586
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,640
our first disclosure site we used

587
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,760
essentially confluence in scroll

588
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,840
viewport and we were surprised by the

589
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,559
amount of not hate but sort of like why

590
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:57,919
don't you have rss and we were like well

591
00:17:57,919 --> 00:17:59,919
complete people like it's such a needed

592
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:00,880
thing and we're like okay this is

593
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,000
interesting it took us 12 months at the

594
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,799
end while we reworked things but rss

595
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:07,600
super handy super great do not be on the

596
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,600
receiving end of customers saying

597
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,280
where's your rss please i think we

598
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,760
published our first advisory site it was

599
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,760
within the first 24 hours someone's like

600
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:16,960
this is great

601
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,360
but rss please we're like okay cool fair

602
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,640
enough so

603
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,200
rss is worth it

604
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,039
and make just click it oop how do you go

605
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,400
back

606
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,080
there we go um so this is what we did

607
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,840
originally we used confluence and scroll

608
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,679
viewport ironically um atlassian

609
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:32,640
actually does the same thing they just

610
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,960
got heavily modified um confluence is

611
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,160
great does all the versioning it's

612
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,400
really nice and easy to use um

613
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,160
scroll viewport again super simple

614
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,240
nothing complex just provides a website

615
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,240
so whatever you put in confluence shares

616
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,200
it publicly it's quite nice

617
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,280
there's a few limitations though rss

618
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,880
that's a difficult one

619
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,760
it doesn't work well if you want to

620
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,600
automate any processes it depends on the

621
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,200
business we're heavy automation it's

622
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,039
kind of what we do so you know we're

623
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,640
like oh it's not automatable enough we

624
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,919
need to make something different um

625
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,679
essentially development skills if you

626
00:19:03,679 --> 00:19:04,960
want to really customize it you're going

627
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,360
to need web development skills

628
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,600
and you've also got to pay so confluence

629
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,200
and scroll viewport costs money so

630
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,840
that's sort of another thing

631
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,960
and then where we went from there is

632
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,720
static site generators so this was our

633
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
next sort of step so we went from

634
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,640
confluence scroll viewport to static

635
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,039
site generators and this was sort of our

636
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,880
ability to say well we can

637
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,280
now really automate our whole process um

638
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,280
hopefully once cbe services comes out

639
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,720
with the publish functionality we can

640
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,480
push everything into a whole pipeline to

641
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,320
say everything goes together as one we

642
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,720
deploy the update to the website we also

643
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,720
deploy the cv id submit it et cetera

644
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,480
everything is good um so static site

645
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,160
change what we went to now what our site

646
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,559
currently runs on is hugo to run

647
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,480
everything

648
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,080
take your pick there are lots of static

649
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,360
site generators it's not the end of the

650
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,200
world but they make life really easy

651
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,039
generally rss is supported out of the

652
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,720
box that was the only reason we changed

653
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,880
it we rewrote the entire thing to

654
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,320
support rss

655
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,360
um

656
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,880
and which was really funny because now

657
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,559
we actually use it ourselves so you know

658
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,600
anyway

659
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,960
um it works well if you want to automate

660
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,120
process so that's super good as well

661
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,480
and then

662
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,559
theming is also super handy

663
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,760
and you can host it on pretty much

664
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,159
whatever you want it doesn't matter az

665
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,240
is hosted on cloud front and adwords so

666
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,919
nice and simple

667
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,679
problems is you require source control

668
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,799
so if your software developer shouldn't

669
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,159
be an issue or software vendor should be

670
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,480
totally fine um

671
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,600
obviously you need to deploy this site a

672
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,760
few other things so there is some cons

673
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,200
to it if you want to get into like some

674
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,280
really heavy customization you're going

675
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,039
to need web development skills

676
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,799
but you know it comes with comes the

677
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,120
territory pretty much

678
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,080
um

679
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,159
github security advisories these are

680
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,960
interesting and fun so

681
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,120
if you're an open source maintainer

682
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,720
these would i recommend you do this this

683
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,960
is the ideal scenario so get up security

684
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,840
advisories if your repo is public

685
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,960
and you have vulnerabilities in your

686
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,200
repo and that repro holds your software

687
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,480
use these

688
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,640
you can be a cna and still use these

689
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,000
what they do is they just give you

690
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,600
essentially the entire template you need

691
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,159
to disclose the vulnerability um it also

692
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,000
allows you to have a bit of a private

693
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,120
workflow for um

694
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,640
for essentially

695
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,919
if you create a studio advisory it

696
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,360
creates a private fork you can work on

697
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,799
it privately it's all nice and secure

698
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:16,720
and then it passes through so

699
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,799
that is the ideal scenario if you're not

700
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,880
a cna you can essentially turn around

701
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,679
and say hey github assign a cv id for me

702
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:25,280
and do the entire three thing through

703
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,039
github security advisories so it's

704
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,480
really quite nice

705
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,919
the big problem is you have to be using

706
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:33,039
github and it has to be public so that

707
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,520
tends to not be the most common thing

708
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,240
but it's there

709
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,760
and because i powered through because

710
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,559
we're sort of built from about time but

711
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,840
final takeaway likewise communication

712
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,760
it's kind of the key really if you're

713
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,960
not communicating with your development

714
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,480
teams you're not communicating with your

715
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,000
management teams

716
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
then really you're not going to do great

717
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,200
at this so you have to communicate with

718
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,159
developers you've got to communicate

719
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,600
with management you communicate with

720
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,360
your customers as well you give them

721
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,799
what they need as well so take the

722
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,880
feedback provide that with them and

723
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,640
essentially it's all happy days at that

724
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,880
point so um that's it from my point of

725
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,400
view um questions i suppose

726
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,480
thank you thank you

727
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,640
talk a little present for you some gin

728
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,919
to help you but

729
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,240
after the beers maybe yeah i think so um

730
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,320
there's a few questions actually um

731
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,159
one from someone called

732
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,440
colby you said um is colby a good

733
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,720
programmer no that's what he says he

734
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,039
says what language is the open source cv

735
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,880
services api code in do you know i test

736
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,039
i do know and i know why he's doing this

737
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,159
because

738
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,840
this is a rant in itself in a talk in

739
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:38,960
itself that is written in javascript now

740
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,880
you could argue why back in api is

741
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,240
written in javascript i'm not going to

742
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,919
get into the discussions of that but i

743
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,280
said before

744
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,559
if you want to talk about that let's go

745
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,799
get a beer and we will talk about that

746
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,918
somewhere that's not here

747
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,840
i also think i saw justin stephen

748
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,360
sitting around outside if you want to

749
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,039
get him back for um ruining your weekend

750
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:58,559
i think yeah

751
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,559
uh another question um someone asked is

752
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,039
um isn't jekyll better than hugo

753
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:03,450
sorry

754
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,440
[Laughter]

755
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,200
so

756
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,720
um yeah so that was a great talk man so

actually show of hands who has a

758
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,840
vulnerability disclosure program in

759
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,360
their company

760
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,679
yeah so there's a few do yeah but yeah

761
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:17,520
