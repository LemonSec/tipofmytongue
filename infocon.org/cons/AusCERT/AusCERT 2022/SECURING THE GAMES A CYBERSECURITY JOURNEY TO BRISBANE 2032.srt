so hopefully everyone knows that in

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,560

the next one so today to talk about how

8
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,039
we're going to secure that

9
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,260
we have Ivano

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,900
and Dirk so Dirk is from NTT one put

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,180
your hand this is Dirk here he's a key

12
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,820
member of NTT cyber team and he has over

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:38,160
two decades of history and experience in

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,200
cyber security and intelligence

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,600
Ivano on the left over here he's a

16
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,860
lecturer at the University of Queensland

17
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:45,480
he's a former police officer in his

18
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,879
first hand Olympic logistical Knowledge

from when he was in charge of security

20
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,039
at the Winter Olympics back in 2006. so

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,420
please welcome both

22
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,060
thanks

23
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,800
[Applause]

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,899
hello everybody and thank you for coming

25
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,480
on a rather wet Friday afternoon to

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,400
listen to Ivana when I talk about

27
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,979
securing the Olympic Games it's a topic

28
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,320
that we're both very excited to share

29
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,180
with you and ivano's even got some

30
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,180
fantastic photos from his experience at

31
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:17,580
Turin 2006.

32
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,580
so raise your hand if you ever had a

33
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,220
dream to be an Olympian or at least an

34
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:24,659
athlete

35
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,240
come on don't be shy I could raise both

36
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,119
of my hands so obviously as kids we have

37
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,220
that dream right being Sports people

38
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:35,100
being cool competing trying to win

39
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:38,400
competition from our backyard into the

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,439
national stage and possibly the global

41
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:42,659
stage right so that's exactly what

42
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,000
Olympic Games represent for athletes

43
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,759
being able to Showcase your skills being

44
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,220
able to prove that you're the best in

45
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,040
the world in your specific field

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,079
now the number of hands that weren't

47
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,579
raised in the room probably tells us

48
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,079
that we're in a room full of cyber

49
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,700
professionals

50
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,860
and cyber Professionals for them the

51
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,420
Olympics is something completely

52
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,000
different for a cyber professional the

53
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,038
Olympics is the convergence of three of

54
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:10,440
the biggest threats out there so when we

55
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,060
think Olympics what we think about is

56
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:15,060
cyber crime talk about an opportunity

57
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,000
for monetization the Tokyo Olympics the

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,180
most recent ones

59
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,520
13.6 billion dollars was being spent on

60
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,739
hosting the Tokyo Olympic Games you

61
00:02:25,739 --> 00:02:27,360
think about the opportunity for cyber

62
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,180
criminals to be able to extort that to

63
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,120
be able to defraud Spectators of of

64
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,860
ticket revenues

65
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,680
etc etc every cyber criminal wants to

66
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,360
Target the bigger stage and that really

67
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,800
is the Olympics

68
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,680
let's talk about nation states

69
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,660
now the Olympics is one of those things

70
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,540
that has a lot of national pride

71
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,860
perhaps even a little bit of national

72
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:52,319
ego involved and you know if something

73
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,360
doesn't quite go your way at the

74
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,819
Olympics one way that you might be able

75
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:00,000
to respond is in the cyberscape

76
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,040
and then we get to hacktivists we keep

77
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,440
saying how big of a stage the Olympics

78
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,720
offers people what better place for

79
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,940
hacktivists to show off their skills

80
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,519
literally on the world's larger stage

81
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,440
and in addition to that if they do have

82
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,120
a cause that they're they're going for

83
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,640
it's a great opportunity to Market that

84
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,080
course

85
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,239
but with all of this you're probably all

86
00:03:21,239 --> 00:03:23,640
asking but you know how bad can it

87
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,620
really get what really happens at

88
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,180
Olympics Games

89
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,940
well probably the worst threat that has

90
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,560
ever been observed at the Olympics

91
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,019
happened at the pyeongchang Winter

92
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:37,080
Olympics a couple of years ago now the

93
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,459
Winter Olympics is a little bit

94
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:39,720
different to the Summer Olympics and

95
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,879
Ivano will talk about that one shortly

96
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,220
but ultimately they're both pretty

97
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,159
significant events on the world stage

98
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,440
and immediately prior to pyeongchang's

99
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,060
opening ceremony it started to go down

100
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,459
ultimately what had happened is a

101
00:03:56,459 --> 00:03:58,920
malware called Olympic Destroyer wiper

102
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,519
malware had been deployed it had been

103
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,720
exquisitely targeted to the point where

104
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,879
it started taking out domain controllers

105
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,739
for the opening ceremony and for the

106
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:10,080
Olympic committees infrastructure in

107
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,220
place

108
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,680
after the fact when organizations

109
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,480
started getting hold of the source code

110
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,220
of Olympic destroyer and started doing

111
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,560
some analysis of it the first thing

112
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,779
anybody noticed is that by the source

113
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,580
code it looked very North Korean and

114
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,919
suddenly everybody said South Korean

115
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,600
Olympics North Korean threat that makes

116
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,860
perfect sense it must have been a North

117
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,479
Korean threat

118
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,000
a little while later somebody looked a

119
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,620
little bit more closely at the source

120
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,940
code I went

121
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,500
actually that that looks almost

122
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,600
identical to some of the code in not

123
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,280
Petra therefore it's got to be a Russian

124
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,300
threat

125
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,880
the reality was was that the malware was

126
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,479
hidden so well and written so well with

127
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,479
tells of multiple Nation States involved

128
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,280
that nobody could really attribute it

129
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,100
for quite some time until somebody found

130
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,500
a correlation which was that in the

131
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,780
commander control infrastructure for

132
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:02,639
Olympic Destroyer there was one IP

133
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,039
address which is also turned up in a

134
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,080
previous Campaign which had been

135
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,560
positively attributed to the Russian Gru

136
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,139
Military Intelligence organization so

137
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:14,820
from that point forward most people are

138
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,160
saying probably this was a Russian

139
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,740
attack and probably it was around the

140
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,020
national prior to National as I said

141
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,940
potentially National

142
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:24,539
um

143
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:26,460
challenges with not being able to

144
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,500
compete under their own flag at the

145
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,840
Olympics with cyber being a great way

146
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,100
for them to respond partially covertly

147
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,020
so what we're going to do today is we're

148
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,940
going to try and take you through a bit

149
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,580
of our journey right through different

150
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,759
editions of the of the Olympic Games now

151
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,240
in 2006 where when I was very very young

152
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,820
and I had much less gray hair than today

153
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:54,000
I was actually lucky enough to work for

154
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,300
the Turing 2006 Winter Olympic Games I

155
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,580
was hired as a deputy venue security

156
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,479
manager I don't know if it because I was

157
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:05,340
a ex-police officer or because of my

158
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,919
amazing skiers or a combination of both

159
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,199
doesn't really matter but that actually

160
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,539
a chance to work for the organizing

161
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,400
Committee of the Winter Olympic Games

162
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,740
now those games were actually quite

163
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,660
different from a cyber security

164
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,120
perspective to games that we could think

165
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,120
of today we didn't have a lot of threats

166
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,819
but they were mainly physical threats

167
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:29,220
right three in particular were the

168
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,199
threats that we were really covering for

169
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,660
and trying to prepare for the first one

170
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,979
was uh

171
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:37,620
the the attempt by the Italian and the

172
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:40,259
French government to build a high-speed

173
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:43,500
train from Lyon to Turin and something

174
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,660
that encountered a lot of opposition in

175
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,699
particular from environmental groups

176
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:49,080
okay so there was a lot of attention

177
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:53,400
towards preparing for possible act and

178
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,340
possible acts and possible attacks by uh

179
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,860
by those groups the second one was the

180
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,780
fact that Italy was going through a bit

181
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,860
of a rough time in terms of

182
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,620
countering and facing militant Islam

183
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,840
groups there had been some some arrests

184
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,660
in the months leading up to the games

185
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,580
and that obviously heightened and

186
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,099
increased the tension from from a

187
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:19,319
physical security perspective and last

188
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:22,319
but not least in 2001 so five years

189
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,460
prior Italy hosted the the G20 and there

190
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:29,160
was a massive issue with the security in

191
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,560
Genova where there was obviously a

192
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,900
couple of people losing their life and a

193
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:34,919
lot of issues from a security

194
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:38,220
perspective so all of these created an

195
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,520
environment in which security had to

196
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,639
really be taken care of and really plan

197
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,220
accordingly from a cyber perspective

198
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,379
just to give you a bit of an overview of

199
00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:52,560
where we are at uh at the moment those

200
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,379
were the months and the years where

201
00:07:54,379 --> 00:07:57,479
stocksnet was actually developed okay so

202
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:00,479
we can actually say we were at the dawn

203
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,419
of of cyber attacks and cyber breaches

204
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:06,060
as we conceive them today now the

205
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,220
mechanisms that we put in place in terms

206
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:11,039
of security at the organizing committee

207
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,379
for the Winter Olympic Games in 2006 was

208
00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:16,860
quite articulated and the tour in 2006

209
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,220
games where the first structured attempt

210
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:24,479
by security to blend in the capability

211
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,240
and the capacity of civilians as in

212
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,940
people working for security for the

213
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,399
organizing committee like myself and law

214
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,120
enforcement okay so we had security and

215
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,219
safety group that was actually in charge

216
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:41,219
of doing a security coordination and

217
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:43,919
planning and different security venues I

218
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,200
was in charge of venue security as a

219
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,540
deputy of course with the main media

220
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,820
center which is where all the media

221
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,399
being that press uh being that

222
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:56,220
journalists been that radio TV and so on

223
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,920
would converge during the games so as

224
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,019
you can understand there was quite a

225
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:04,800
complex situation to to secure in

226
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,720
particular because of the complexity of

227
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,339
stakeholders that were coming to the

228
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,380
venue and also the complexity of the

229
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,540
technology that was associated with it

230
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,240
we had something like 20 000 law

231
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,300
enforcement there were numerous no-fly

232
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,580
zones created during the during the

233
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,459
games in particular before and after the

234
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:25,860
opening and the closing ceremony and

235
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,600
this is something that we never got a

236
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,180
chance to see directly but we knew that

237
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,519
in the mountains around the Torino where

238
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,260
they were the Olympic venues there was

239
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,839
something like 3 100 snipers ready to

240
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,140
intervene if Tink tinks got to one

241
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,000
escalation to the breaking point okay

242
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,600
last but not least tons and tons and

243
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,880
tons of volunteers to manage and this is

244
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,640
something that oftentimes with the

245
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,560
Olympic Games we tend to forget without

246
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,200
volunteers Olympic Games simply don't

247
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,480
happen and I guess from a cyber

248
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,180
perspective of our one of the volunteers

249
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,820
mean in cyber security well of course

250
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,920
inside their threats okay so massive

251
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,019
potential for for Insider threats there

252
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:11,399
back then the main cyber instance and

253
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:13,740
the main Potential Threat from a cyber

254
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,660
perspective because of the configuration

255
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,880
of the networks was literally somebody

256
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,040
with a compromise device being that a

257
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,600
USB stick or being that a laptop

258
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,300
plugging into the network so with access

259
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,760
to the venue being able to compromise

260
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,740
the network but luckily we didn't really

261
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,620
have any issues from that I'm just glad

262
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,540
they were in The Sniper team absolutely

263
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,180
so the the Focus there from a security

264
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,700
perspective was really a layered

265
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,740
security approach one-on-one okay

266
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,740
Progressive access credentials being

267
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,079
able to protect the core of your venues

268
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,240
and then establishing concentric circles

269
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,220
and giving different credentials in

270
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:53,040
terms of physical access to the venue to

271
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,980
the people that add to work in the in

272
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:58,620
the Olympic Games in all honesty if I'm

273
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,839
thinking of for example Brisbane 2032

274
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:03,839
Winter Olympic Games tend to be easier

275
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,120
to manage from a security perspective

276
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,120
because they tend to have a smaller

277
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,640
territory they tend to the venues tend

278
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,820
to be spread across a smaller radius and

279
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,440
from a physical security perspective

280
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,120
especially also because of the fact that

281
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,500
you're dealing with mountains and

282
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,040
physical barriers tend to be easier to

283
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,399
manage obviously my time I would say was

284
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,620
spent 80 percent in doing security

285
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,680
planning which translated in this 120

286
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,079
page venue security plan which we had to

287
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,660
prepare in the lead up to the to the

288
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:40,140
game uh so detailed where we even had to

289
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,140
take pictures of Security Seals that we

290
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,959
would put on the doors across the venue

291
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:48,899
and specify the different details about

292
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,660
when the seals were put there in case

293
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,639
the seals were broken why they were

294
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:55,079
broken and so on and so forth and

295
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,180
believe me they were broken very very

296
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,600
many times not for malicious reasons but

297
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,700
because of negligence and because of the

298
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,519
fact that people at the end of the day

299
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:07,500
needed to get things done and probably

300
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,899
the remaining 20 of my time obviously

301
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,300
during the games in themselves was a

302
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,940
spender spent coordinating uh security

303
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,700
so we did a lot of planning a lot of

304
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,980
planning for treating things as business

305
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,800
as usual and then you got the kickoff of

306
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,680
the games and it all becomes a massive

307
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,180
uh co-existent cohesive contingency it's

308
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:32,160
a bit like that old sporting saying from

309
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,380
Mike Tyson of everybody has a plan until

310
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,579
he get punched in the face right

311
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:38,160
absolutely and I can't tell you punching

312
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,600
Bean punched in the face actually was

313
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,399
quite uh quite common not because of

314
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,959
anything in particular but because of

315
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,899
the nature of the games right so from

316
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,639
from a nighty infrastructure perspective

317
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:49,860
uh I must confess things were quite easy

318
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,500
back then the situation was a typical

319
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,180
situation in which as and you know

320
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,740
sometimes in cyber security we joke

321
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,839
about it these days you could literally

322
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,060
simply unplug things from the internet

323
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:03,839
and everything would be fun okay and the

324
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,300
the the the it the the company that was

325
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,519
managing it sorry Dirk is one of your

326
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:11,040
competitors that's okay we got Tokyo

327
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,100
yeah of course you did uh kind of did

328
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,720
things quite well from that perspective

329
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,820
the infrastructure was quite simple

330
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,740
um honestly speaking there was a game

331
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,839
management system which was pretty much

332
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,980
the part of the network that would allow

333
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:28,380
operators to translate people's wiping

334
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:30,800
their Badges and access cars Parts into

335
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,240
credentials for access to the different

336
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,339
sites and the different components of

337
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:37,440
the venue and an information diffusion

338
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,779
system which as the name itself says was

339
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:42,360
nothing but the system to collect data

340
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,940
about things such as events athletes

341
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,699
competitions and so on and so forth and

342
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:50,100
push them out to the audience to

343
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,420
Spectators and so on overall the

344
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:57,120
contractor employed something like 2000

345
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,339
it people

346
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:03,600
385 servers 5 000 computers so you know

347
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,120
thinking of the scale and Dirk is going

348
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,760
to talk about it with the reference to

349
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,220
Tokyo things were quite different back

350
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,519
then we didn't really have many cyber

351
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,620
breaches properly speaking probably the

352
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,680
main one which I can remember of was the

353
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:23,399
case of this contractor that was picked

354
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:25,260
up saying something along the lines of

355
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,660
if I want I can just simply go on the

356
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,300
site and mess up the network and cause

357
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,399
massive damage and obviously somebody

358
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,220
probably law enforcement hurt this

359
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,660
person saying this they went there and

360
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,220
they said all right we need to have a

361
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,199
chat about it right but that's as far as

362
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,180
it went really we didn't really have any

363
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,760
uh main many issues from that

364
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,399
perspective because of the nature of the

365
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:48,839
event but also because of the

366
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:52,980
configuration of DLT infrastructure that

367
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,380
was probably the last time in history I

368
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:59,339
could say that an Olympic event didn't

369
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:02,339
really raise so many concerns from a

370
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:05,279
cyber security perspective Beijing 2008

371
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,320
actually showed us afterwards that

372
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,000
things started getting very very

373
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,820
challenging for main events from that

374
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,639
perspective absolutely and you did say

375
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,740
that the Olympics were one big

376
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,779
contingency and I think from that photo

377
00:15:18,779 --> 00:15:20,279
and the changing hair color it probably

378
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:23,040
was a pretty stressful experience yes

379
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,560
absolutely love that photo yes thanks

380
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,440
for that so let's move forward 14 years

381
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,800
to Tokyo now probably the first thing

382
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,779
that everybody will notice about Tokyo

383
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:36,320
2020 is that it actually occurred in

384
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,360
2021. Tokyo if you remember was an

385
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,339
Olympic games that was the first games

386
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:44,279
to be postponed by a year or postponed

387
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:47,160
at all since World War II so it's not

388
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,779
something that happens at all Olympic

389
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:52,380
Games The Show Must Go On irrespective

390
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:54,600
of anything else but with the the

391
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,759
hitting of covert it's the covert

392
00:15:56,759 --> 00:15:58,920
pandemic the games had to be postponed

393
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,320
initially and immediately in the lead up

394
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,560
to the next iteration of the games which

395
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,699
was Tokyo 2020 in 2021 the third wave of

396
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:12,000
covert was hitting Japan so in the eight

397
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,300
weeks prior to the Olympics they became

398
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,699
a much more digital Olympics and they

399
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:19,920
were already going to be because quite

400
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,480
literally you couldn't have any

401
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,940
Spectators in some stadiums that that

402
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,680
experience had to be streamed out to

403
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,959
other people and indeed in other

404
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:29,220
stadiums you could only have a much

405
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,660
smaller number of Spectators than you

406
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,000
you otherwise would have had

407
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,680
but let's talk about the digital

408
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:36,480
Olympics what did that actually look

409
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,279
like well I don't know if you've ever

410
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,380
been to a swimming event but you know

411
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,180
you kind of sit there watching them

412
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,620
there's these things moving in the pool

413
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,120
and they're going really really fast you

414
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,100
go oh that's cool Australia is winning

415
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,899
and then it turns out to be somebody

416
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:51,180
else entirely it's really hard to see so

417
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,100
in a lot of the events where Spectators

418
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,199
could be there augmented reality was

419
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,240
deployed and what this meant was that

420
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,680
Spectators could actually have that

421
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,199
experience of going yes that is my team

422
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,579
that's winning and I'm not going to look

423
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:03,899
like an idiot by cheering when I

424
00:17:03,899 --> 00:17:06,419
shouldn't be cheering but in addition to

425
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:09,599
that robotics featured very heavily in

426
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,699
the Olympics now everybody's probably

427
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:14,760
seen YouTube videos of robots in Japan

428
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,980
it is definitely part of the tech scene

429
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,280
over there but robots were used

430
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,959
extensively in the Olympics everything

431
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,939
from camera vehicles at the golf and

432
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:25,319
I'll talk a little bit more about that

433
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:29,340
one shortly through to welcome robots at

434
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,320
various venues where people were able to

435
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,780
go right through to the point point that

436
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,520
in the Olympic weightlifting where

437
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,200
you've got these really strong people

438
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,179
lifting the the weights and then

439
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:40,860
dropping them some of the volunteers

440
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,299
that Ivano talked about then have to

441
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:43,740
pick up those weights and put them back

442
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,140
on a rack afterwards so robotic

443
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,480
exoskeletons were actually used to allow

444
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,580
those volunteers to not break their back

445
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,780
while they're doing that because usually

446
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,820
they're not quite at Olympic level to

447
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,580
with the weights that are involved so

448
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,280
lots of Robotics and the other big thing

449
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,679
that was prevalent was this idea of how

450
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,620
can we project The Experience beyond the

451
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,660
venues themselves now you'll see the

452
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,220
gulf in the top right hand corner there

453
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,900
and some people are probably looking at

454
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,700
that going it looks a little bit like

455
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,559
something off an Xbox or perhaps a

456
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,900
Nintendo switch and that's because it

457
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:18,840
was a recreated scene what happened at

458
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,400
the golf end at the badminton that I'll

459
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,260
talk about on the next slide is that

460
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,960
there were cameras literally everywhere

461
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,059
and the data was being extracted from

462
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:29,700
those cameras and in almost real time

463
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,340
models were being created so that you

464
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,799
could actually create a a spectator

465
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:37,200
experience for people outside of the the

466
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,760
venue and they could actually pan

467
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,220
cameras move around as if they were

468
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,020
actually there and moving to a different

469
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,020
vantage point at the Gulf it's the first

470
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,480
time in history that it's ever been done

471
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,840
at scale without a studio being involved

472
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,220
so typically these things are done on

473
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,320
green screens and very specialist

474
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,179
cameras all fixed locations and the like

475
00:18:57,179 --> 00:19:00,780
all of this was done in real time using

476
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:03,360
cameras on real backgrounds of trees and

477
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,700
so on and so forth now

478
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,740
the one that I like the most though is

479
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,360
this one here which you'll see at the

480
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,240
top of the screen is a 55 meter long

481
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,640
television and it's floating that's

482
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,840
pretty cool

483
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,000
that TV is in the bay where they were

484
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,860
conducting the sailing events it's

485
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,660
called karari is the system that came

486
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,700
out of the back of some research that

487
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,120
NTT did as part of our Telco and

488
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,059
ultimately what it is is it's a way to

489
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:32,640
immerse Spectators in a sport of sailing

490
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,320
because if you've ever been to sailing

491
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,940
before you can see a bit of it but a lot

492
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,559
of it happens a long way off from where

493
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:40,559
you're able to see it so this TV is fed

494
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,380
by a fleet of which is a number of it's

495
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,940
not as big as not as impressive as it

496
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,160
sounds of drones carrying these camera

497
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:49,140
rigs that you can see on screen there

498
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,360
each of those four cameras is a 4k

499
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,100
camera and it's taking footage

500
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,260
consistently and streaming it back to

501
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:58,200
the TV as are a number of boats also

502
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,660
carrying fixed 4K cameras watching

503
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:02,220
everything that's going on and then

504
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,020
everything is stitched together in real

505
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,240
time so that Spectators can watch it on

506
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,100
the very large screen that's quite close

507
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,039
to them when covert hit it became

508
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,140
important to be able to take that

509
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:15,299
experience and put that elsewhere so the

510
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,100
the Japanese government set up other

511
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,960
venues that people could in a socially

512
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,360
distanced manner watch the sailing from

513
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,480
so these TVs were all installed in other

514
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,640
facilities as well so in near real time

515
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,860
sailing's happening drones are flying

516
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,600
boats are going around taking footage

517
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,240
everything was being beamed back via

518
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,039
private 5G that was installed

519
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,500
specifically for the games and then put

520
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,299
onto the TV and then streamed by

521
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:41,340
literally thousands of kilometers of

522
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,799
brand new fiber that was installed just

523
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:46,320
for the Olympics absolutely phenomenal

524
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,780
uplift in the amount of technology that

525
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,120
was in place in Tokyo so that the

526
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,860
Olympics could be what they were

527
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:54,780
on the bottom right hand side of the

528
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,179
screen this is the badminton that I

529
00:20:57,179 --> 00:20:58,980
mentioned now badminton is historically

530
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,320
really hard for anybody to film period

531
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,059
because a little shuttlecock moves

532
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:05,159
really really fast and it's kind of

533
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:07,380
small as well so most cameras don't

534
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,419
really pick up a great deal of it and

535
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:10,919
you don't really get to see much of the

536
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:12,120
event that's happening you just see

537
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,799
people kind of running around without

538
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:15,480
the shuttlecock itself

539
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,700
with technology being the way that it is

540
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,679
for the Tokyo Olympics they were

541
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,840
actually not only able to film it but

542
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,419
film it extract that data in real time

543
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:27,480
recreate the scene both virtually and in

544
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,179
Holograms by the way for people to be

545
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:31,860
able to watch the badminton in a

546
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,480
spectator-like experience anywhere else

547
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,520
that they happen to be that had the the

548
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:38,280
Holograms projecting so super super

549
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,980
connected most people in this audience

550
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:42,480
are probably sitting there going wow

551
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,799
that's a lot of I.T infrastructure

552
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,539
that's a lot of new things that must

553
00:21:45,539 --> 00:21:47,580
have gone in to make that happen I can

554
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,340
tell you that ntt's infrastructure so we

555
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,080
were a gold sponsor one of a number of

556
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,539
gold sponsors so just hours alone we

557
00:21:54,539 --> 00:21:56,159
went from having hundreds of thousands

558
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:58,200
of endpoints on our net point on our

559
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,840
Network to having literally hundreds of

560
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,360
thousands more endpoints in about an

561
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,740
eight week period in the lead up to the

562
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,659
games for the eight week period of the

563
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,700
games the Olympic Games plus the

564
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,640
paralympic games so phenomenal amount of

565
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,280
additional data to be able to collect

566
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:16,140
and monitor and do something within a

567
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,880
cyber sense as it happens

568
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,500
and most people are probably sitting

569
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,360
there going wow what an attack surface

570
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,100
like you know attack surface of the

571
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,919
office back in Brisbane or Sydney not so

572
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,240
impressive when you compare it to

573
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,340
something like this at the Olympics

574
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,260
and just to talk Concepts I guess before

575
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,460
we talk about what actually happened

576
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,620
when the Olympics kicked off

577
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,299
the idea of attack surface is really

578
00:22:36,299 --> 00:22:38,700
important it tells us where cyber

579
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,799
criminals nation states activists can

580
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,080
actually find ways into the network

581
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,880
threat is also a really important

582
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,600
concept here so threat is ultimately

583
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,039
capability times intent like it says so

584
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:52,260
it's basically saying if there's a group

585
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,840
that has the capability to attack UAE

586
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,700
they've got the skills and a reason to

587
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,020
do so then there's a threat there that

588
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,120
we need to talk about very different to

589
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,880
risk and the reason I say that is risk

590
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,679
is all about consequence risk is all

591
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:06,960
about something happening in the case of

592
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,940
the Olympics there's a few major things

593
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,740
that we worry about one of the big

594
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,240
things we worry about is the show

595
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,380
stopping

596
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,679
so if The Telecast stops if the the

597
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:18,240
streaming can't get out to the broader

598
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,700
world if the event has to be postponed

599
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,620
anything like that that's the big

600
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,000
consequence that people are really

601
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,679
worried about and another big

602
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,720
consequence that everybody's always very

603
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,460
worried about is is back to that

604
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,039
monetization and fraud thing we have a

605
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:34,100
lot of Spectators who pay a lot of money

606
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,720
oftentimes who do it via a ballot so

607
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,340
it's it's a little bit of luck if you

608
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,320
even get a ticket if you then get

609
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,840
defrauded and some some fraudster makes

610
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,340
off with the money that you've paid to

611
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,840
potentially get a ticket and the ticket

612
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,120
never arrives that's a really bad thing

613
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,000
for the image of the Olympics so threat

614
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,919
versus risk quite different in this

615
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:55,559
context threat is ransomware group

616
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,840
nation state so on and so forth

617
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,299
consequence game stopping somebody

618
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:01,860
stealing money

619
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,179
so let's talk about what actually

620
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:05,400
happened at the Olympics the good news

621
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,580
is despite the very large growth rate in

622
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,980
the number of of attacks um you'd

623
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,240
certainly be happy with that growth rate

624
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,940
in any business but going from 400 to

625
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,880
450 million between Turin and Tokyo is

626
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,100
quite a big jump in in the cybersphere

627
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,559
there were no attacks that actually made

628
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,900
it through and postponed any events or

629
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,179
stopped any streaming so on and so forth

630
00:24:27,179 --> 00:24:28,919
the threats that did eventuate were

631
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:30,600
quite interesting though on the bottom

632
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,880
left of the screen you'll see there's a

633
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,000
very very realistic log on screen this

634
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,100
was a log on screen that was sent in a

635
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,500
fishing campaign to another gold sponsor

636
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,720
who was providing other parts of the it

637
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,760
infrastructure and ultimately it was

638
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,900
used to steal a whole bunch of

639
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,279
credentials that then could have

640
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,799
subsequently been used to perform an

641
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:52,140
attack the other thing that we saw a lot

642
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,360
of through the games was the emotec

643
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:57,900
malware group immotet is well known in

644
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,279
the banking space it's all about

645
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,799
stealing logon details for internet

646
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:04,440
banking stealing money essentially it's

647
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:06,299
also widely used in botnets though so

648
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:07,860
when people see it in the context of an

649
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,720
Olympics it's kind of that thing of is

650
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,460
somebody thinking about DDOS type

651
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,140
considerations

652
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,720
the final one is really interesting and

653
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,700
this was another wiper malware that was

654
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,279
deployed just before the Tokyo games it

655
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:22,320
was about two weeks or so when it was

656
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,059
initially detected

657
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:26,279
and what ultimately happened is a number

658
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:27,779
quite a number of people in Japan

659
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:30,059
received an email with what looked to be

660
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:31,620
a PDF in there it was actually an

661
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,919
executable file masked as a PDF if they

662
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:37,380
clicked on that on that PDF what ended

663
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:38,940
up happening is is the the malware

664
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,100
started and the people who did the

665
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,620
source code analysis on this found a few

666
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,820
interesting things when the malware

667
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,820
kicked off first interesting thing is is

668
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,100
that it looked for a whole range of file

669
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,799
types including specific file types that

670
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,900
come out of a Japanese only word

671
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,200
processor so very targeted timed for the

672
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,600
Olympics targeted so that it works in

673
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,700
Japan even though they perhaps use a

674
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,679
different word processor to other parts

675
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:06,840
of the world the second interesting

676
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,059
thing about it was that as it goes

677
00:26:09,059 --> 00:26:11,400
through its process of of trying to find

678
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,559
files to wipe and then wiping the files

679
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:16,799
it would also take the infected endpoint

680
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,919
off to a really dodgy adult website and

681
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,240
then the third thing is it would delete

682
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,919
itself including all of the other files

683
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:25,320
on the endpoint and the theory behind

684
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,539
that ultimately is that when a forensic

685
00:26:27,539 --> 00:26:30,240
investigator comes in after the fact

686
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,100
everybody thinks the attacker is

687
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,539
ultimately looking at it going they

688
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:34,679
probably won't find the malware because

689
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:36,240
it's deleted itself but they probably

690
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,919
will find the logs that says you went to

691
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,020
a dodgy website and therefore the

692
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,460
conclusion might be that you got

693
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,799
infected that way rather than from a

694
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:45,539
wiper malware campaign in this

695
00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:47,820
particular case now this threat's never

696
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,340
been attributed to my knowledge perhaps

697
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:52,140
it was by some governments but not

698
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:55,020
publicly attributed anyway has a little

699
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,400
bit of the Hallmarks of perhaps the

700
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,260
nation-state type attack when you talk

701
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,059
about that misattribution when you talk

702
00:27:00,059 --> 00:27:01,740
about the fact that there was no

703
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,960
extortion or anything like that it could

704
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,000
have also just been some somebody in the

705
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,740
act of a space or script kitty space

706
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:09,779
really just trying to show off what they

707
00:27:09,779 --> 00:27:12,240
could actually do so interesting threat

708
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,679
but again in terms of a risk the

709
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:17,520
consequence was never actually realized

710
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,620
so what I've got up on screen here are

711
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:22,380
four of the key lessons that were

712
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:26,159
published uh publicly from NTT after our

713
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,260
experience with the games and really

714
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,059
what they're intended to do in this

715
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:32,100
context is to say what are some of the

716
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,779
things we need to think about or the

717
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:36,600
lessons we need to take from Tokyo 2020

718
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,380
and apply them for Brisbane 2032. the

719
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,360
first one is about data now I talked

720
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,440
about the fact that we went from

721
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,240
hundreds of thousands of endpoints to

722
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,399
hundreds of thousands more endpoints all

723
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:49,559
in an eight-week period every single

724
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:51,720
endpoint in that network has what we

725
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,820
call the trifecta deployed there's three

726
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,500
separate vendor products which I won't

727
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,899
name here deployed to basically provide

728
00:27:57,899 --> 00:28:00,299
EDR with High Fidelity Telemetry off the

729
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:03,179
endpoint as well as a URL filtering

730
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:05,640
capability so to get really clear data

731
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,500
about what that endpoint is trying to

732
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,659
communicate with as well as a

733
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:11,580
vulnerability management capability so

734
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,860
that we can have near real-time updates

735
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,500
on whether any of our endpoints across

736
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,140
that wide variety of of attack surface

737
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,720
are actually doing something that they

738
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,340
shouldn't in terms of patch status and

739
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,600
the like

740
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,120
ultimately the idea was and the way that

741
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,100
the the threat responses worked is we

742
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,200
aimed at stopping the first breach so if

743
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,940
you if you stop the first Bridge the

744
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,140
second the third the fourth and

745
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,720
ultimately the final one where

746
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,820
ransomware encrypts the system or the

747
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,799
whatever it is actually happens that can

748
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,679
never happen if you stop it at the the

749
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,940
initial reconnaissance or the initial

750
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,120
breach stage the second piece was noting

751
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,700
the I guess the scale of the

752
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,220
infrastructure in Tokyo it literally

753
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,500
isn't and wasn't possible to keep

754
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,960
everything perfectly hygienic in terms

755
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,940
of a cyber hygiene environment you can't

756
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,500
make sure everything is 200 percent

757
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,360
patched and everything is connected

758
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,279
right and has all the right agents on it

759
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,620
Etc all of the time there is just too

760
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,080
much on on that Network so there was

761
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,539
quite detailed processes put in place to

762
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:14,159
ensure that when it mattered when that

763
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,080
risk was about to or could be realized

764
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,960
I.E right before an event in a venue

765
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,299
quite detailed processes to then go

766
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,279
through and sweep all of the it

767
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,020
infrastructure and make sure that it

768
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,000
actually had cyber hygiene applied

769
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,559
appropriately so that when that risk was

770
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,940
realized it couldn't actually be

771
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:32,220
realized third point is around training

772
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,159
and simulation and red teaming

773
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:37,260
wargaming over and over and over for

774
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,179
literally the two years prior to the

775
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:41,460
Olympics we had 200 people in the

776
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,899
government soft for the Olympics there

777
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:44,179
were other companies that had

778
00:29:44,179 --> 00:29:46,080
significant numbers in there as well

779
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,080
plus a very large contingent of Japanese

780
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,340
government

781
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,260
all of those organizations were

782
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:54,240
wargaming two years in advance of the

783
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,000
Olympics and also testing and and to the

784
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,100
fourth Point testing their processes

785
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:00,840
learning to collaborate learning who was

786
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:03,059
who in the zoo and who who was doing

787
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:04,740
what in each particular part of the

788
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:08,159
organization such that when the ongoing

789
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,620
contingency happen people at least knew

790
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,659
who to pick up the phone to or what to

791
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:14,760
put into the system to get the job to

792
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:17,279
work properly

793
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,260
so I mean it's impressive to think about

794
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:24,299
you know us going from 400 instances or

795
00:30:24,299 --> 00:30:26,520
or cyber instances from a cyber security

796
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,520
perspective interior in 2006 and really

797
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,059
probably one or two uh serious ones uh

798
00:30:33,059 --> 00:30:36,419
into 450 million uh instances with uh

799
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:38,820
with Tokyo at the same time if you

800
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,640
switch uh this this discussion around

801
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,980
obviously we need to think about the

802
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,100
different experience that uh audience

803
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,840
but even athletes and even you know

804
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,200
Society in general has been able to to

805
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,140
take advantage of from in a time span of

806
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,700
you know relatively short time span

807
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,039
we're really talking about uh 16 years

808
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,279
right from during 2006 to today so the

809
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,980
point now is where next what are we

810
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,600
gonna do next what is going to happen

811
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,620
with the Brisbane 2032 what are the next

812
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,080
10 years and plus because we also need

813
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,960
to keep into account Legacy what are

814
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,179
they gonna look like how do we prepare

815
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:20,340
for that so we wanted to kind of

816
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,559
conclude our presentation with a bit of

817
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,620
a reflection on some of the mega trends

818
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:29,220
that we see potentially event trading in

819
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,380
the next 10 years right the first one

820
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,059
which is a very very important one and

821
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:34,620
it's someone something that here in

822
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:37,380
Australia particularly is is certainly

823
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:39,659
relevant the need for greater

824
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:41,580
accessibility okay we're talking about

825
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:45,000
large events that happen once every two

826
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,220
years if you consider the alternation of

827
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:50,820
uh winter and summer Olympic games but

828
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,159
we also still talk about people in

829
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:55,440
remote area or remote areas that don't

830
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,419
have physical access to those games

831
00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:59,460
right because they cannot travel because

832
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,220
of whatever reason right so one of the

833
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,659
key questions that we're going to need

834
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:05,880
to find answers for in the next 10 years

835
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,760
is how are we gonna give greater

836
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,539
accessibility for the games in in not

837
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:14,159
just in a geographical you know

838
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,419
perspective from a geographical

839
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:17,820
Viewpoint also thinking of people that

840
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,700
have different abilities right obviously

841
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,279
together with this it means that we're

842
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,000
going to need to cater for large-scale

843
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,100
customizations of the the user

844
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,260
experience and of the customer and the

845
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,760
audience experience right so

846
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,919
understanding that there's going to be

847
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:36,779
more and more of a blend between the

848
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:38,580
physical and the digital world and

849
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:40,380
understanding a from a business

850
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,960
perspective how does that translate in

851
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,340
different products and in different

852
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:46,679
Technologies and B from a cyber security

853
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:49,740
perspective how does that translate from

854
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:53,220
a protection standpoint another piece to

855
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:55,740
add to the to the picture is that

856
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,899
probably some of the technology is

857
00:32:57,899 --> 00:32:59,760
already there we're going to be able

858
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,159
likely to see an evolution of it but we

859
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,320
can already started start putting our

860
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,200
ants onto it and the the references is

861
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,880
to the metaverse for example right

862
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,100
something that we all have heard about

863
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,080
we talk about we can't really just

864
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:16,919
Define it very well just yet this idea

865
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:19,019
of having an always-on virtual

866
00:33:19,019 --> 00:33:21,480
environment that is not just an add-on

867
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,700
to our physical your life and to what we

868
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,679
do and how we breathe and how we live

869
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:27,659
it's something that runs in parallel

870
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:30,559
right really the concept of Second Life

871
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:34,039
uh taken in a very literal way okay

872
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:36,299
associated with that obviously with the

873
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:38,820
advancement of Technology things such as

874
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,799
and I'm sure that in a cyber security

875
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,960
audience this is a really appealing

876
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,899
topic uh the role of e-games the role of

877
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:48,480
Esports okay how are they gonna change

878
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,480
in the next 10 years all right uh how

879
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,460
are we going to be able to have people

880
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:56,039
with different abilities and and with

881
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,360
different profiles and different

882
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,539
personas compete on the global stage

883
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,240
okay so even not very athletic

884
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,039
individuals like my friend Dirk here

885
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,620
will be what are you saying we'll be

886
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,020
able to actually compete in the sports

887
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,000
arena that obviously is going to need to

888
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,639
go together with digital transformation

889
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,980
at scale and we all know that we don't

890
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,418
really know how that's going to look

891
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:21,239
like but we all know that last but not

892
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,980
least something that we need to always

893
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,379
keep in mind with advancement and

894
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:28,260
progress in technology comes also a

895
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,899
major impact on our world impact on

896
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:33,359
materials impact on environment so we're

897
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,399
going to need to cater for a different

898
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:37,440
level of sustainability from energy and

899
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,719
energy consumption perspective and so on

900
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,859
and so forth

901
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:43,320
I think you know ultimately the

902
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,060
organizing committee has already said

903
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,980
that this is going to be a cost neutral

904
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:50,040
and a carbon neutral game so you know to

905
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,199
make that happen I see that as a huge

906
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,480
opportunity for our industry and the

907
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,460
technology industry more broadly

908
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:58,140
unfortunately we're probably not the

909
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:00,420
only people who see the huge opportunity

910
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,940
in all of that and ultimately we needed

911
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,500
to think about this in terms of cyber

912
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,839
security implications as well to begin

913
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:09,480
with let's look at even Tokyo and the

914
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,460
the new types of devices of the new

915
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,500
types of connectivity that were required

916
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,839
to enable that experience last year let

917
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,000
alone the Brisbane experience in in 10

918
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,200
years time

919
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,000
right now we've got some great

920
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,859
technology out there and there's a lot

921
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:24,660
of the vendors in this conference that

922
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,839
can secure iot really really well but

923
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,700
what about securing the metaverse what

924
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,260
about securing property within the

925
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,900
metaverse there's even talk already of

926
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,320
tickets for the Olympics being nfts how

927
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,359
do we secure those how do we make sure

928
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,820
that people don't get defrauded out of

929
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:44,280
those as we saw at the Tokyo games with

930
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,900
some of those attacks that we talked

931
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,880
about and very important on that not

932
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,579
Dirk what are the underlying legal

933
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:53,040
Frameworks that we have to prepare for

934
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,560
you know the metaverse for example right

935
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,720
there's been already occasions I believe

936
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,480
it's just after

937
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,280
meta was launched and Facebook turned

938
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,079
into meta where there's been cyber

939
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,240
bullying online very serious examples

940
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,920
and very serious cases of survey

941
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,900
bullying now if you take that to the

942
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,940
extreme and start thinking about how

943
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,980
does that work in an environment where

944
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,260
there's digital athletes and physical

945
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,359
athletes competing and there's also

946
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:20,460
audience from a digital perspective

947
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,760
wearing their AR and VR devices and

948
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,980
trying to enjoy the experience that

949
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,960
creates massive opportunities for

950
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,540
episodes such as for example cyber

951
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,040
bullying from that perspective for sure

952
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,099
Ivano and you know I can't see a world

953
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:38,220
where by the 2032 Olympics right now in

954
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,500
Turin and certainly in Tokyo people were

955
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:43,440
able to compete and then go back to the

956
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,780
athletes Village and be shielded from a

957
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:48,180
lot of what goes on in social media and

958
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:50,400
the like probably not quite as easily in

959
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,740
Tokyo as it was in Turin but by the time

960
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,680
we get to Brisbane 2032 I reckon there's

961
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,060
going to be all sorts of push for

962
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,099
athletes to actually engage with

963
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:01,320
Spectators after their event and talk

964
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,540
about how the event worked going back to

965
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,280
Mike Tyson that we mentioned earlier I

966
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,140
mean look at that recent aircraft

967
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,820
incident where somebody engaged slightly

968
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:10,440
the wrong way and look what resulted in

969
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,200
in that case um no charges though but at

970
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,240
the end of the day you can see that

971
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,820
happening where there's Nations involved

972
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,099
there's national pride involved there's

973
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:22,619
ego and even the situation where

974
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:24,660
somebody just has a cause that they want

975
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:27,359
to make known the whole Tick-Tock

976
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:29,820
effectively to be able to do that with

977
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,260
athletes via the metaverse that's a

978
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,579
whole new Cyber problem right yeah

979
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:34,859
absolutely uh just cautious of time so

980
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:37,500
just to close on this now I when I Was

981
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,480
preparing this this presentation I was

982
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,640
really thinking about the trajectory of

983
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:44,400
cyber security as a domain from my

984
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,380
personal experience which year in 2006

985
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:48,780
to Tokyo and then moving forward to

986
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:52,140
Brisbane 2032. in in Turin I can say

987
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,680
that with reasonable confidence the idea

988
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,960
that was that cyber security was

989
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,940
actually a function of physical security

990
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:02,880
get your physical security right and

991
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,320
you're pretty much sure that nothing's

992
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,820
gonna happen from a cyber perspective

993
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,220
then obviously as we progressed over the

994
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:10,680
years the two things started blending in

995
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,660
a little bit and and we know cyber

996
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,060
security started having uh really more

997
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,220
and more prominence now the point now is

998
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,320
are we going to get to the point and you

999
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,820
know this could be the case with

1000
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:23,520
Brisbane 2032 or or even earlier

1001
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,099
editions of the Olympic Games where the

1002
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:29,040
the equation will be really uh swapped

1003
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,380
around right and the physical security

1004
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:33,960
is going to become a function of cyber

1005
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,820
security that's certainly a question

1006
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,460
that we need to ask ourselves now to

1007
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:40,740
conclude on a positive note I I believe

1008
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:43,079
and certainly that's the case speaking

1009
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:45,119
to an audience of cyber security vendors

1010
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:47,220
and players and organizations they're

1011
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,619
certainly going to be a great potential

1012
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:52,380
to work on developing Technologies

1013
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:55,020
Solutions working on the human factor

1014
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:58,260
and really strengthening our cyber

1015
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:02,220
security Legacy towards 2032 and after

1016
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,859
that for sure so we wanted to conclude

1017
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:07,380
our presentation with a bit of a call

1018
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,240
for action and as we started talking

1019
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:14,400
about being as kids Keen to engage in

1020
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,200
sports and complete at the law at the

1021
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,720
global level let's all be cyber defense

1022
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,380
gold medalists at Brisbane 2032. thank

1023
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:25,520
you very much for your attention

1024
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:30,060
thanks very much Ivano and adirk it was

1025
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,200
a fantastic talk

1026
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,460
um there were a few questions we're

1027
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,720
probably out of time but a lot of those

1028
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,520
are around Intel sharing between

1029
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,560
different groups and obvious things like

1030
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:40,200
that so uh and perhaps even call for

1031
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:41,940
cyber security volunteers might be

1032
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,079
something on the cards you never know

1033
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:44,400
