1
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:06,160
good morning everyone uh our next

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,759
speaker dave is going to be presenting

3
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,280
on some of the threats affecting

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,639
australia's renewable energy

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,080
transformation please give it up for

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,080
dave

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,240
thank you um i think this is made for

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,000
taller people so

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,600
you want this one

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,240
uh sure

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:25,359
okay

12
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:27,920
yeah good one stay in the camera okay um

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,599
yeah thanks for thanks for coming along

14
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:30,640
um

15
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,399
uh if there's other mel burnings i know

16
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,200
simon's melbourne so uh you know we all

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,800
came up here to uh escape the cold

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,600
weather

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,200
and no rain but

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,879
we brought it with us so sorry about

21
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,640
that

22
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,640
so yeah i'm uh going to talk to you a

23
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,480
little bit the obligatory sort of this

24
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,840
is where i work and this is what we do

25
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,079
sort of slides um then i'm going to go

26
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:51,360
on to the um

27
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,600
the transformation that's taking place

28
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,160
in the australian energy sector um i'm

29
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,160
going to focus on distributed energy

30
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,600
resources

31
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,840
it's an area of huge growth and it's

32
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,920
really what's driving australia's energy

33
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,720
system transformation at the moment

34
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,880
i'll give you an idea of how distributed

35
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,960
energy resources sort of fit together

36
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,799
like conceptual architecture kind of

37
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:13,920
view

38
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,520
and define some terms and so on

39
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,560
next i'm going to have a look at the

40
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,720
cyber security threats when when you're

41
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:23,119
talking about the dr ecosystem and what

42
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,119
we need to be aware of

43
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,119
and just i'm going to briefly cover the

44
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,880
the standards and the security controls

45
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,799
that are currently being talked about

46
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,720
like internationally and within

47
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,079
australia

48
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,600
and hopefully we'll have five minutes or

49
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,559
so for some questions

50
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,439
so um energy australia we're a retailer

51
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,560
and a generator um we've got about two

52
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,799
and a half million customers uh across

53
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,640
the national energy market and the

54
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,399
national energy network which is

55
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,240
essentially the east coast of australia

56
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,399
all the way from queensland to tasmania

57
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,759
and across to

58
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,799
adelaide

59
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,799
uh six and a half percent of uh

60
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,040
renewable projects in the national

61
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,680
energy market uh are what energy

62
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,479
energy australia is responsible for

63
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,439
and

64
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,080
i guess one of our lead purposes in

65
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,200
being

66
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,879
an energy provider in australia at the

67
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,319
moment is to accelerate the

68
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,640
transformation to clean energy

69
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,840
so what's going on with the australian

70
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,080
energy sector at the moment

71
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,360
well obviously things are changing

72
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,879
rapidly

73
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,560
there's less reliance on thermal

74
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,480
generators so the big coal fired and

75
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,840
fossil fuel fossil fuel fired generators

76
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,360
and there's lots more renewables and

77
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,440
it's happening at speed i'll get into

78
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,720
how fast a little bit later

79
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,560
the energy system is becoming less

80
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,560
centralized because households are

81
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,560
investing in small scale generation and

82
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,239
storage capabilities

83
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,160
and the energy system itself is starting

84
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,640
to need to cater quite um drastically to

85
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,400
two-way flows

86
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
that's energy coming from the generators

87
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,680
to the consumers and the other way

88
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,599
around it certainly wasn't built that

89
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,280
way so it's a it's quite an interesting

90
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,319
challenge to have to deal with

91
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,920
and lastly

92
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,159
there's significant innovation in energy

93
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,879
products energy bundles and smart energy

94
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,319
things

95
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,840
and all of these attributes are really

96
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,879
what's called the smart grid

97
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,120
so at a really high level the

98
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,560
electricity generation in the

99
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,879
traditional or sometimes called the bulk

100
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,280
energy system predominantly involves

101
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,319
these large fossil fuel fired generators

102
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,239
which are usually close to mines or

103
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,480
wells which is their power source

104
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,760
and they're in reasonably remote areas

105
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,720
now high voltage transmission lines then

106
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,159
transport the electricity from that

107
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,799
generator those generators

108
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:48,400
and to substations where it's required

109
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,840
now substations have a lot of

110
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,319
transformers

111
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,120
uh transformers that's it

112
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,599
and uh they transform the high energy

113
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,840
the high voltage supply to low voltage

114
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,920
supply which is really what

115
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,040
is then distributed through the

116
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,040
distribution networks

117
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,400
to our

118
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,480
demand side which is

119
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,799
where we consume the energy

120
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,959
so when we talk about demand side

121
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,040
generation demand side threats we're

122
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,040
really talking about the significant

123
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,238
increase in consumer

124
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,720
consumer solar panels

125
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,520
ev storage facilities

126
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,040
and

127
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,720
and as that oops

128
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,800
and as that increases we're finding that

129
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,520
uh

130
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,400
the

131
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,560
need for the large thermal generators is

132
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,400
starting to decrease

133
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,000
and it's putting a lot of strain on the

134
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,199
existing energy network because it

135
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,639
simply wasn't built to cater for

136
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,160
large flows in the other direction

137
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,040
i see this is the kodak moment really

138
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,199
for the energy sector globally

139
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,520
it's a decades-old paradigm it's being

140
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,520
superseded by a technology advancement

141
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,800
at speed

142
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,880
we've got plant assets across australia

143
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,039
they're becoming financially unviable

144
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,639
and it's leading to accelerated

145
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,520
mothballing or decommission times and at

146
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,039
the same time we've also got this

147
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,479
dot-com-like explosion of

148
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,520
internet-connected smart devices

149
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,880
with energy-specific smart appliances

150
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,320
features and functions to provide

151
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,720
precise control over the usage and gen

152
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,320
energy consumption

153
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,440
now they're helping consumers save money

154
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,440
and also generating money if you've got

155
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,199
you know enough generation and storage

156
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,560
on your house you can sell it back into

157
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,840
the market

158
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,759
and it's becoming part of the day-to-day

159
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,840
routine

160
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,680
so who's got solar panels show of hands

161
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,280
right who's got a family member with

162
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,919
solar panels

163
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:43,520
right so yeah it's a pretty it's a

164
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,360
pretty good percentage of of uh

165
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,000
australia it's actually one in four over

166
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,240
one in four homes in australia have

167
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,160
solar panels or the ability to generate

168
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,840
power on their own that doesn't mean

169
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,000
they're necessarily grid connected but

170
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,160
they do have that capability

171
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,680
and that's massive it's actually the

172
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,960
highest

173
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,560
residential capability in the world

174
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,639
for a generation capability on the roof

175
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,759
kind of makes sense because with a lot

176
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,919
of sun

177
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,199
um

178
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,800
and at the moment we've got we're in a

179
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,280
situation where the energy grid is uh is

180
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,120
has got so much renewable energy

181
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,280
generation capability that we're

182
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,120
reaching a threshold of more than a

183
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,199
hundred percent of energy generation

184
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,280
that's required in the grid is being

185
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,960
supplied by renewables

186
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,520
now in general it's only instantaneous

187
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,440
like couple hours at a time

188
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,240
but

189
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,080
south australia for example in both

190
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,560
october and december of last year

191
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,520
sort of

192
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,600
surpr went over that to that 100

193
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,680
threshold so that was essentially

194
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,000
generating all of the state's needs with

195
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,080
renewable energy and that's massive and

196
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,120
in fact last last week the start of last

197
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,960
week california the whole state of

198
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,039
california in the u.s did the same

199
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,720
so it's the first time ever that they'd

200
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,360
actually achieved 100 renewable

201
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,639
penetration

202
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,479
for instantaneous

203
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,400
electricity generation in

204
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,840
california so that's that's kind of

205
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,239
massive

206
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,360
so distributed energy resources time for

207
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,479
some definitions i think

208
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,919
so we're talking about smart devices

209
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,000
you could say it's iot most of them are

210
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,840
internet connected they can generate

211
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840
consume or store electricity

212
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,120
and they've got the smarts to either

213
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,840
actively manage their demand or supply

214
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,919
either through some preset thresholds in

215
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,240
the system itself or by instruction over

216
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,280
communications networks

217
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,440
there's three main types you've got

218
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,280
obviously your generation

219
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,800
assets so your solar panels and

220
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,440
inverters your battery storage systems

221
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,199
and the evs evs are a little bit of a

222
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,199
special case because they can be both a

223
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,759
load and a generation capability or

224
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,000
supply capability because

225
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,520
with some of the i guess the new

226
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,520
products and capabilities that we're

227
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,120
we're delivering at speed with our

228
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,360
technology you can actually start to

229
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,599
discharge the batteries in your car

230
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,599
and monetize that so if you're not using

231
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,440
your car on a wednesday you can tell

232
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,000
your uh your aggregator that uh yeah you

233
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,240
can use my battery on a wednesday and

234
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,240
earn me some money to sit in the garage

235
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,800
other types of distributed energy

236
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,280
resources are the types of appliances

237
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,599
that we have that are smart and have the

238
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,160
ability to actively manage their their

239
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,080
load so we're talking about sort of

240
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,240
machine machine washers

241
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,840
air conditioners pool pumps heating

242
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,440
those sorts of things

243
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,039
it's generally called demand response

244
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,039
which is a slightly different

245
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,279
set of standards and terminology but it

246
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,880
basically means by

247
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,559
using some of the smarts involved and

248
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,279
then potentially you know cooking in

249
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,440
with the spot price of electricity you

250
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,839
can time the usage of those appliances

251
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,959
to really keep manage manage the costs

252
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,880
for running those appliances pool pumps

253
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,320
is a classic one you know why bother

254
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,000
having your pool pumps going when the

255
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,080
energy costs the most

256
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,920
get it get it done when the spot price

257
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,640
is kind of the lowest

258
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,200
the last one really is less about active

259
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,839
uh generation or load it's more about

260
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,000
sort of the smart meters so everyone

261
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,279
would know the advanced metering

262
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,839
infrastructure and uh in i think you've

263
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,440
got them in queensland we've got the

264
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,760
most most places these days certainly in

265
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,680
victoria and these are really just

266
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,560
providing real-time telemetry and usage

267
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,120
and also providing some idea about the

268
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,959
the reliability and the stability of the

269
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,040
network

270
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,800
back to the distribution network

271
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,479
providers and and amo as it turns out

272
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,880
so while higher penetration of der is

273
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,839
obviously great news from an

274
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,760
environmental perspective there's also

275
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,320
issues and it's important to understand

276
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,640
that electricity generation is really

277
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,800
only part of the role that these more

278
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,720
traditional thermal generators play in

279
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
the energy market

280
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,880
system security is like a it's a energy

281
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,560
industry term it basically means

282
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,800
reliability and stability and there's a

283
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,680
lot of

284
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,040
rules we have

285
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,360
in the national energy market the when

286
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,200
the western australian energy market has

287
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,959
the same and that really defines the

288
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,320
thresholds that

289
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
that need to be met to maintain

290
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,040
stability and reliability in the in the

291
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,880
electricity network

292
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,760
it's kind of operational requirements

293
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,920
this quote comes from the

294
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,320
australian energy market operator

295
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,240
amo and they do this what's called the

296
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,839
integrated system plan every couple of

297
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:27,360
years and they update it it's kind of a

298
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,440
road map that sort of dictates you know

299
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,800
where things are going what's the sort

300
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,000
of things that we need to worry about

301
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,600
and so on

302
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,720
and this is taken from the 2021 22

303
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,440
version of this is out i think july but

304
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,440
it's basically saying because we've got

305
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,160
so many renewables and der devices

306
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,959
in and that are displacing all the older

307
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,440
thermal generators the system security

308
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,279
and reliability services that have been

309
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,200
traditionally provided by those thermal

310
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,399
generators

311
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,800
uh are basically need to be provided by

312
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,320
those ders

313
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,800
so it basically means

314
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,519
as we keep increasing the penetration

315
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,920
ders are basically going to have to be

316
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,200
more flexible

317
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,959
more interoperable

318
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,240
and more reliable to provide more than

319
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,240
just generation services they need these

320
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,680
stability services as well

321
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,519
and if we can't provide those system

322
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,839
security services then the quality of

323
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,399
supply could be affected

324
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,839
and there's lots of different terms

325
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,600
about what that could have mean it could

326
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,399
be sort of simply some appliances

327
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,640
appliances basically stopping to to

328
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,720
function properly could be localized

329
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,880
substation circuit braces breakers

330
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,920
tripping those sorts of things

331
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,880
so why do we need to secure smart ddrs

332
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,800
it almost sort of makes uh sort of

333
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,200
common sense really

334
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
they'll increasingly need to

335
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,399
remote

336
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,360
operate

337
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,360
and accept remote instruction to make

338
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,760
sure that the functioning of the grid

339
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,880
and the dr is consistent

340
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,279
the bulk energy system has historically

341
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,440
operated as a closed environment we've

342
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,240
got sort of mature technically capable

343
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,639
actors with infrastructure behind fences

344
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,120
and walls systems connectivity using

345
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,760
proprietary networks and communicating

346
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,920
over proprietary protocols

347
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,000
mostly scada and so on

348
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,079
the dr's have almost entirely the

349
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:21,760
opposite characteristics to the bulk

350
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,040
energy system

351
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,560
they're purchased or leased by members

352
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,000
of the public they're generally

353
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,600
installed in a public or untrusted

354
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,639
environment in your roof or your carport

355
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,399
and they're primarily communicating over

356
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,320
the internet potentially on trusted

357
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
network and not necessarily using

358
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,480
proprietary protocols either so

359
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,959
a lot of the protocols to control dr

360
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,120
actually using open protocols now web

361
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,959
protocols

362
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,320
so

363
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,839
so we've got remotely controllable

364
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,600
internet connected devices

365
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,279
now powering our grid what could

366
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,079
possibly go wrong

367
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,160
so as a cyber security professional i'm

368
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,560
an architect by trade

369
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:03,200
what we do is we do risk management so

370
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,839
a statement here i sort of put together

371
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,440
really is a sort of a motherhood

372
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,680
statement if you could significantly

373
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,839
manipulate the way that the dr devices

374
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,240
operate on mass so obviously one or two

375
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,519
devices here and there doesn't matter

376
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,200
but if you actually get a large

377
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,720
collection

378
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,000
then you could actually breach the

379
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,839
intended thresholds of the energy system

380
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,160
and you could impact it um

381
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,040
system security and reliability

382
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,279
so that could again mean localized

383
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,720
brownouts

384
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,200
appliances substations tripping

385
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,040
potentially if it was bad enough you

386
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,440
could actually get rolling blackouts

387
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,959
and potentially even islanding of

388
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,480
certain states so where you'd actually

389
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,680
have to

390
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,760
disconnect states if a particular state

391
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,480
was you know badly affected

392
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,600
that's kind of what happened in south

393
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,120
australia like a number of years ago you

394
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,680
had an islanding situation so yeah

395
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,959
you're on your own sort of thing

396
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,720
so cyber security threats

397
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,839
um

398
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,079
being a boxers and lions kind of guy

399
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,519
i'll start off with some boxes and lines

400
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,040
so you've got

401
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,360
a conceptual architecture really

402
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,800
involves a customer

403
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,800
purchasing some kind of dr device or

404
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,560
leasing it a lot of bundles these days

405
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,399
coming from different aggregators and

406
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,880
retailers allow the customer to lease a

407
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,480
device

408
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,480
and then an installer will come along

409
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,480
and connect that into

410
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,639
the distribution network

411
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,360
and also generally up to the the

412
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,639
internet

413
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,399
or up to at least a network whereby they

414
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,000
can get firmware updates and

415
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,240
configuration data from the manufacturer

416
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,959
now in general there's a there's a

417
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,320
customer wants to monetize the

418
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,600
investment that they've made which is

419
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,680
perfectly reasonable um virtual power

420
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,760
plant operator will then

421
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,079
be connected into the system as well

422
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,320
and then they can actually dispatch the

423
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,560
power that's being stored in

424
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,320
so the batteries or whatever else the

425
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,120
customer has installed in their premises

426
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,399
and that way the customer can earn some

427
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,279
money

428
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,519
uh and additionally often there's uh you

429
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,040
know a smart app or something that's

430
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,040
that provided by the manufacturer or the

431
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,800
aggregator to say well you know this is

432
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,760
your battery and this is how it's

433
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,839
performing or this is how much energy

434
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:10,800
you're uh

435
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,639
how you're creating off your roof at the

436
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,079
moment so

437
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,000
of those in the room who've got panels

438
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
who's got a smart app or something on

439
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,519
their device that tells them how they're

440
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,000
going yeah exactly and this is kind of a

441
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,639
general example architecture um and

442
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,320
there's obviously a lot of different

443
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,240
ways things are put together but this is

444
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,519
kind of generally the way it goes

445
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,759
so if we look at

446
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,279
all the different actors that we have in

447
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,440
this ecosystem and we're going from the

448
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,199
bulk energy system which is behind

449
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,880
closed fences and walls proprietary

450
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,959
protocols blah blah blah blah blah

451
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,639
this is where we are at the moment we

452
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,240
have you know a number of different

453
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,199
actors in this system that are potential

454
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,758
sources of threats

455
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,680
that compromise is unlikely right

456
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,079
yeah not sure about that um

457
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,600
back to the context of our risk

458
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,800
statement we want to work out a

459
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,680
likelihood um and i wanted to sort of

460
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,120
cover a couple of

461
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,959
mainstream media articles that have kind

462
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,199
of been in the news lately and this is

463
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,680
about six weeks ago it was in the abc

464
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,440
um it was a bit of a jawboning article

465
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,800
really it didn't really have any facts

466
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,240
behind it

467
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,680
but

468
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:21,920
this one didn't really get a great deal

469
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,079
of coverage but it's i think this is

470
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,800
particularly relevant to this discussion

471
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,240
um

472
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,160
that the article was or the issue was

473
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,639
covered separately by a different media

474
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,639
outlet and you know they kind of kind of

475
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,199
got straight to the point really

476
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,240
so um

477
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,800
so you essentially have um you know some

478
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,920
devices ups's can be remotely hijacked

479
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,680
and destroyed you can replace the

480
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,360
firmware put a crypto miner in there

481
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,600
whatever you want to do

482
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,199
now this is really interesting from my

483
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,440
perspective for three reasons

484
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,920
personally firstly it's white labeled

485
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,079
device but it's actually distributed by

486
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,160
schneider electric and schneider is a

487
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,560
massive energy industry vendor

488
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,799
lots of scada sites are schneider skypes

489
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,559
they're you know 30 billion annual

490
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,559
revenue company they're massive

491
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,959
um so you know read into that what you

492
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,359
will but the fact that we've got people

493
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,039
that you know to an extent should know

494
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,079
better

495
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,359
distributing devices with these

496
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:20,400
vulnerabilities that's kind of an issue

497
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,720
uh the second issue here is uh the

498
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,119
second key point is its supply chain

499
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,679
risk so yes it was schneider's names on

500
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:28,720
the tin

501
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,559
but this is a white label

502
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,000
device it was built by a subsidiary but

503
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,600
it sort of shows you that supply chain

504
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,440
risk like if the manufacturer of the

505
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,880
devices

506
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,039
are having issues identifying

507
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,039
vulnerabilities in devices that their

508
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,960
subsidiaries are providing kind what

509
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,520
chance do consumers have to actually you

510
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,360
know better manage supply chain risk if

511
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,320
they're buying a device

512
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,240
and lastly these devices ups is

513
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,720
basically an inverter so you're actually

514
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,880
inverting dc battery storage into ac

515
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,160
and this is exactly what we're talking

516
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,679
about in this example conceptual

517
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,919
architecture

518
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,600
so if i point out we've got this

519
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,840
vulnerability here in an inverter

520
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,280
it's obviously not this inverter because

521
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,039
it's a you know it's not connected up to

522
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,280
the grid but so let's just say we had a

523
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,200
an ability to for that same cve to be

524
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,120
relevant to inverters in this ecosystem

525
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,360
then essentially any of these actors

526
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,039
with direct access to the device on the

527
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,200
same network could then do whatever they

528
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,080
want

529
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,160
they could you know create new firmware

530
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,520
push it to the device and have it do

531
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,880
whatever they'd like

532
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,520
um no authentication so

533
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,200
and you've also got a couple of paths

534
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,400
here that could also be sources or

535
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,320
threat of those threat scenarios

536
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,840
replacement of firmware on the device

537
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:48,799
again do whatever you want if you get

538
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,480
that

539
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,039
upload that new firmware

540
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,720
and of course other threats because

541
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,679
you're

542
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,840
on the uh you're connected into that

543
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,320
sort of ecosystem

544
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,440
um

545
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,200
and also i mean given that we're using

546
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,880
in a lot of cases we're using the home

547
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,559
routers uh

548
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,280
you know we've seen doorbells and

549
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,880
you know smart switches and whatever

550
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,240
else they've got sort of questionable

551
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,559
security practices a lot of people

552
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,160
aren't the kinds of people that are in

553
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,000
this room that are probably going to try

554
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,520
and secure

555
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,760
an implementation of iot devices on

556
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,280
their home network

557
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,640
and you know that's kind of the

558
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,160
situation that we're left with pretty

559
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,320
much a vulnerable ecosystem

560
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,559
so we've got a vulnerable device what

561
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,760
sort of controls can we look at

562
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,520
so first and foremost robust

563
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,440
identification authentication and

564
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,840
authorisation

565
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,320
i've done identity for a lot of years in

566
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,000
banks and so on and you know it's a

567
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,480
really really tough nut to crack it's

568
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,000
it's always changing it's one of those

569
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,160
things that you need people you need to

570
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,280
actually

571
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,120
do your use cases understand what

572
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,960
privileges are required map them

573
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,039
appropriately to roles you know make

574
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,240
sure that people that leave the

575
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,400
organizations are you know d provisioned

576
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,080
or whatever else

577
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,720
so it is it's a definitely a tough uh a

578
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,760
tough area but obviously um you know

579
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,760
that particular vulnerability with no

580
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,960
authentication you can change the

581
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,559
firmware you know that's that'll be one

582
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,919
you you probably want to start to

583
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,240
control with some identity and access

584
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,640
management capabilities

585
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,760
secondly

586
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,280
making sure that your

587
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,640
firmware that's getting updated is

588
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,320
coming from an authentic source and it's

589
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,440
maintaining its integrity

590
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,480
segmentation making sure that uh that

591
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,080
maybe the devices themselves are running

592
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,679
on a separate segment so it's not as

593
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,760
easy to just directly access those

594
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,000
devices and obviously hardening any

595
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,760
systems that are implementing the

596
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,120
security controls to stop that

597
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,919
and lastly security monitoring um i'll

598
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,600
talk about that a little bit later but

599
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,960
yeah security monitoring is obviously

600
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,120
really important in this ecosystem

601
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,080
so on to some words about standards and

602
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,400
security controls now

603
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,880
so globally when we talk about

604
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,200
standards in the der space

605
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,760
they really focus on two areas now first

606
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,760
of all is those rules and regulations

607
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,919
for actually interacting into certain

608
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,000
regional markets

609
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,679
operational requirements you really you

610
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:20,000
could say so the standards are first say

611
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,919
the u.s and australia are different in

612
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,600
that respect because you know we have

613
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,159
different voltage for example

614
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:27,840
and secondly there's also a

615
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,440
concentration of

616
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,960
standards defining the functional

617
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,440
capabilities of the dr devices

618
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,520
they're changing quite rapidly

619
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,360
as we sort of work out we need more and

620
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,320
more capabilities for those devices it

621
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,480
also includes in a lot of cases security

622
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,880
controls

623
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,559
the kinds of functional capabilities are

624
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,880
basically the ability to withstand an

625
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,640
adverse

626
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,799
or withstand or recover quickly from an

627
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:56,400
adverse condition on the grid

628
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,159
now interoperability is a key goal

629
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,000
and from an i.t

630
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,080
architecture perspective that really

631
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,159
means integration ease of integration so

632
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:07,520
we're talking about standardized

633
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,120
messaging standardized information

634
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,280
models and apis that elicit the

635
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,120
consistent behavior before between

636
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,520
devices in general and between

637
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,880
particular devices of the same family

638
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,200
so that means if i make an api call to

639
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,840
this dr device and it's a battery i

640
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,400
expect that device to do this thing and

641
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,559
that needs to be consistent across all

642
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,240
of the batteries that are that are built

643
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,159
and then sent into the grid because

644
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,280
otherwise you're just going to end up

645
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,360
with a you know a mess

646
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,919
needs to be reliable

647
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,000
it means the manufacturers if you've got

648
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,520
standards that dictate all of this stuff

649
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,400
that

650
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
manufacturers can build

651
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,240
and certify compliance to a single

652
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,919
standard and then they can sell those

653
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,240
devices into multiple different markets

654
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,760
makes it cheaper for them cheaper for

655
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,720
the end consumer

656
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,159
oops

657
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,240
i don't know how to do that

658
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,760
um

659
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,679
it also makes the products easy for a

660
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,000
customer to move around so

661
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,880
you can basically potentially pick a

662
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,960
different battery you could have a solar

663
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,799
inverter and a solar panel

664
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,640
setup that's got a different type of

665
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,039
battery and maybe the battery you maybe

666
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,559
want to get a tesla powerwall battery

667
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,039
for example because you like the look of

668
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,039
it or it fits in in the cupboard nicely

669
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:23,919
or whatever it might be whatever it

670
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,760
might be um or maybe they've got better

671
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,760
service and warranty for a particular

672
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,480
type of battery

673
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,360
so

674
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,760
from an international perspective and if

675
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,039
we're talking specifically about

676
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,679
security

677
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,760
there's lots of different regional

678
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,880
standards

679
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,000
the

680
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,240
british standards institute and european

681
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,600
standards have

682
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,360
different overall standards talking

683
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,840
about dr functionality and capability uh

684
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,360
but the u.s

685
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,679
u.s is sort of i think really charged

686
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:56,960
ahead in a lot of these areas because

687
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,350
they've kind of had to um

688
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,440
[Music]

689
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,320
the california and hawaii two particular

690
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,400
geographies that have really sort of

691
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,080
you know really taken off when it comes

692
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,159
to renewable energy

693
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:12,480
so back in 2003 ieee 1547

694
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,240
was it's called the standard for

695
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,760
interconnecting distributed resources

696
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,520
with electric power systems

697
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,279
so you know it's sort of that's pretty

698
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,559
much it

699
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,120
it sort of describes those functional

700
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,279
and sort of grid requirements

701
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,760
in 2005

702
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,039
the federal government in the us

703
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,760
basically said that this is our standard

704
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,559
so if you look at that from 2005 now

705
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,960
that's almost 20 years ago

706
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,799
20 years ago the us was thinking about

707
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:41,679
how they're going to deal with

708
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:45,039
distributed energy resources

709
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,039
we're a long way behind we don't have

710
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,640
any of that so

711
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,919
um

712
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,240
so the uh in this standard also gets

713
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,200
keeps getting updated um

714
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,880
and

715
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,720
one of the one of the particular member

716
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,720
member-led organisations that's actually

717
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,799
progressed a lot of this work

718
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,200
is sunspec you might know sunspec from

719
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,880
sunspec modbus

720
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,840
obviously a protocol in the more scada

721
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,960
ocs ot space

722
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,120
they've got a protocol uh it's basically

723
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,000
a

724
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,919
i call it a profile like it's a subset

725
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:20,240
of capability subset of functions that's

726
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,440
been taken from ieee 2030.5

727
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,240
uh 2030.5 a smart grid communications

728
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,840
protocol

729
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,400
the c-sip is basically a subset of those

730
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,320
functions and that's really just

731
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,960
targeted to the us grid particularly

732
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,880
california

733
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,679
to meet what's called ca rule 21 which

734
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:41,679
is the mandated requirement so if you're

735
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,919
going to try and connect up a d device

736
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,200
in california

737
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,360
you have to

738
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,279
certify the device and if you certified

739
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,600
a c-sip then you meet those california

740
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,320
rule 21 requirements

741
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,400
the other services that sunspec offers

742
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,039
is the ability to certify a device and

743
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,200
they also offer a pki

744
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,360
for those certified devices so they run

745
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,880
the standard they make sure that your

746
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,880
devices can meet that standard and then

747
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,320
if you sort of get those ticks in the

748
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,400
box then you can actually get a

749
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,159
certificate then you can then use to

750
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:14,240
bake into your devices to provide

751
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,120
identity and secure comms with anybody

752
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,158
talking seasip

753
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,919
in australia we there is some work it's

754
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,320
kind of happened very speedily um given

755
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,480
that there's a lot of a lot of focus on

756
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,480
this at the moment um so arena uh has a

757
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,720
i think tank there's lots of acronyms

758
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,559
here sorry about that i'll get mixed up

759
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,360
myself um c-sip oz has basically been a

760
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,679
working group to take csip which is

761
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,400
again the subset of 2030.5

762
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,080
from the us and modify it for

763
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,919
australia's system again we have

764
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:49,840
slightly different operating kind of

765
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,000
requirements in australia so it does

766
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
need a few tweaks and so on

767
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,720
there is some security capabilities in

768
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,600
csip and there's a dr working group

769
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,799
around cyber security that's looking for

770
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,880
just validating the controls in csip to

771
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,000
make sure that they're the right things

772
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
for australia

773
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
by all means go and have a look it's not

774
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,240
that complicated

775
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,240
but from a security perspective but

776
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,840
there's definitely some questions that

777
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,720
need to be asked

778
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,960
so the kinds of questions that uh need

779
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,559
to be asked i've i've sort these are my

780
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,080
thoughts only in observations they're

781
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,240
not sort of um they're not energy

782
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,520
australia's by any stretch of the

783
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,880
imagination

784
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,720
um again that identity and access

785
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,240
management question

786
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,000
access control there's nothing in the

787
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,840
standards that currently dictate how you

788
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,039
should do that

789
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,799
there's suggestions about how you could

790
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:39,840
do that

791
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,279
but because it's not standardized

792
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,279
there's no way to sort of

793
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,200
implement it in a standardized fashion

794
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,840
um i think that's something that's

795
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,919
absolutely super important

796
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,279
it's something identity and access

797
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,640
management is something that i mean it's

798
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,960
tough but we understand it really well

799
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,799
so we should be applying those types of

800
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:00,399
controls in our standards environment

801
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,480
secondly the legacy environment so

802
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,960
there's lots of inverters batteries

803
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,159
solar panels cars etc out there um that

804
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,840
won't be compliant to any of these

805
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,520
standards because they were bought five

806
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,240
years ago or however many years ago

807
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,000
so whatever security standards and

808
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,679
controls we put in now

809
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,399
um we know that there's a whole body of

810
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,360
the 10 or 15 year lifetime devices out

811
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,279
there that won't be able to be compliant

812
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,480
and that could be for a number of

813
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,480
reasons but even

814
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,840
some of them just won't have the compute

815
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,760
power to deal with certificates and

816
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,840
validating assert or you know creating a

817
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,200
set of private public keys because they

818
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,640
just don't have the don't have the grunt

819
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,640
the other thing i've found in general

820
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,799
with all the standards maybe except one

821
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,480
there's one in the ev space which seems

822
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,720
to be they've looked really well in this

823
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,760
area

824
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,799
that's called ocpp

825
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,720
is that they're not really using assume

826
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,399
breach as a principle when they're

827
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,240
looking at the standards very heavy

828
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,399
focus on preventative controls

829
00:28:58,399 --> 00:28:59,840
but then the question is what do you do

830
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,240
if you are breached how do you how do

831
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,240
you knock a particular manufacturer's

832
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,279
device or devices off the network if you

833
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,399
want to if they've been compromised

834
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,720
let's say you know someone sent some

835
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,960
malware or ransomware infected firmware

836
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,799
down to every air conditioner

837
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:19,360
for you know it's it's it's possible but

838
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,000
so how do you stop that from spreading

839
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,279
not being a great deal of thought in

840
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:27,200
that at the moment because it's hard

841
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,520
from non-technical reasons this is a bit

842
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,440
of a wind really but

843
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,840
i just think that

844
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,919
in any cyber security engagement if

845
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,080
you're in an organization you generally

846
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,840
need to understand your risk appetite

847
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,320
because that really dictates how much

848
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,360
time money you spend um

849
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,760
on implementing security controls

850
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,520
and i don't think there's been much

851
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,120
understanding of how

852
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,960
what our risk appetite is for grid

853
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,559
systems and we can say oh it's you know

854
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,240
it's rock solid and it's you know but

855
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,320
it's not at the end of the day consumers

856
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,159
are going to have to pay for it it's not

857
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,279
the government's got not going to turn

858
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,200
up with 60 billion bucks and say hey

859
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,799
this is how we secure our der

860
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:06,399
environment so it's going to flow down

861
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,480
the down the line through retailers

862
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,799
through manufacturers manufacturers of

863
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,320
devices

864
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,320
to secure so

865
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,240
and even the question of who is to make

866
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,320
that who makes that call who makes the

867
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,000
call about what amount of risk is

868
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,840
acceptable for the energy grid

869
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,080
mandatory compliance obviously ci sons

870
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,480
is lots of fun

871
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,799
it doesn't cater for dr at the moment

872
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:32,960
specifically unless you're actually

873
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,320
aggregating

874
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,480
30 megawatts or above

875
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,559
um i can see why they did that so they

876
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,760
don't want to

877
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,840
squash competition for the small players

878
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,760
that are trying to you know encourage

879
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,320
renewable energy um but by the same

880
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,720
token um there are a number of different

881
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,960
aggregators that'll

882
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,120
hit that threshold and exceed it

883
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,600
at some point and i doubt that you'll be

884
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,480
able to

885
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,880
continue this

886
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,559
this trajectory that we currently have

887
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,880
without some kind of regulation

888
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,440
essentially so that 30 megawatts which

889
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,760
is about 6 000 5 kilowatt

890
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,000
exporting devices will probably go down

891
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,279
at some stage

892
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,279
possibly

893
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,480
uh standards hell so um i mean

894
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,000
yeah it's kind of ubiquitous in our

895
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,799
industry and in in i.t in general um

896
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,080
you've obviously got the geographic

897
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,440
bodies that like to sort of take

898
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,000
ownership and and uh and build their own

899
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
standards because they're making that's

900
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,760
their business model you've got the

901
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,640
professional organizations that are also

902
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,080
producing their standards which may or

903
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,679
may not align with what's coming out

904
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,240
from a geography perspective

905
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,600
and then you've got

906
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,799
i guess more the specific families and

907
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,480
energy industry groups and

908
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,000
not-for-profit groups that are creating

909
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,279
their own standards

910
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,360
um and i can see that already that

911
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,120
there's we're gonna have an interesting

912
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,960
time sort of mapping security controls

913
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,640
between different standards

914
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,399
uh to work out so you might you might

915
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,760
end up having to

916
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,600
um you know have multiple different sets

917
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,840
of security controls just to meet the

918
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,200
standards that are applicable in this

919
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,519
area

920
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,720
uh yeah look i think i'm getting close

921
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,200
to time now so um look a couple other

922
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,799
questions and really just getting back

923
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:15,840
again to those standards really

924
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,600
the energy security board that sets

925
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,519
policy for australia's

926
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,279
energy grid system particularly them

927
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,440
have sort of asked specifically

928
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,679
some of the questions

929
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:32,240
with the pki pki is sort of a 20 30.5

930
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,840
constructs not mandated but it's

931
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,600
basically it's how you would actually

932
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,640
try to establish trust in this ecosystem

933
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,720
do we need one do we need more than one

934
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,039
you know how might that work um is it

935
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,279
okay if it's not an australian entity

936
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:48,559
that is the ca for our grid um it's a

937
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,120
really quite fundamental question um

938
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,000
and there's lots of different answers

939
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,399
lots of pros and cons that need to be

940
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,480
worked through

941
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,039
and particularly in this area 2030.5 and

942
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,679
csip they you are not able to revoke

943
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,159
certificates

944
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:07,760
so you can't actually revoke

945
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,159
certificates you could probably do some

946
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,559
some you know smarts to sort of block

947
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,159
certain certificates so like in that

948
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,399
scenario where a manufacturer did get

949
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,279
popped and did start to you know push

950
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,080
malicious firmware down down the line um

951
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,080
what would you do um and how would you

952
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,200
do it quickly

953
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,279
at the moment we can't revoke um which i

954
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,200
think um

955
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,720
i mean if you've got a pki that's it's

956
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,480
all about trust so

957
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,720
you know it sort of seems a little bit

958
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,559
yeah a little bit strange

959
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:39,600
um compliance and governance again um

960
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,960
if there are standards and these are

961
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,399
going to come up the wrong way around

962
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:43,679
fantastic

963
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,120
if their standards how often do we test

964
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,320
the standards

965
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,760
what's the impact of the standards from

966
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,159
a cost and an implementation perspective

967
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,360
with what happens to the legacy

968
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,799
environment

969
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,640
and ongoing assurance like if there is a

970
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,880
standard that you need to check for

971
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,480
personally from my perspective if we've

972
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,360
got a really high risk our risk appetite

973
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,720
is low for this area

974
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,159
i would think that every time you create

975
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,239
a new set of firmware you should test it

976
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,239
against the standard so you get a bit of

977
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:11,679
an idea that from an assurance

978
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,599
perspective maybe you can even review

979
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:14,879
the code to see that there's nothing

980
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:16,560
malicious in there and make sure you've

981
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,560
got a you know you've got proper

982
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,239
functionality and proper ability to

983
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,239
apply the security controls but there's

984
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,439
a cost associated with that

985
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,879
yeah so not just winding up now

986
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,719
essentially

987
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,520
energy system is increasingly leveraging

988
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,040
potentially from vulnerable smart

989
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,239
devices and iot systems

990
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,239
the uh the interconnected system that

991
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,918
ecosystem is really only strong as its

992
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:44,000
weakest link and supply chains of

993
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,239
particular interest and is very tough to

994
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:48,960
deal with and to secure

995
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,560
and the standards i think are heading in

996
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,440
the right direction but the

997
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,480
implementation is going to be

998
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,879
interesting

999
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,800
all right that's all i had for today any

1000
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,119
questions

1001
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:01,839
uh

1002
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,839
first can we uh get a round of applause

1003
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,000
for dave

1004
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,119
um so we do have a few minutes for

1005
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,200
questions um this one's just a quick one

1006
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:14,079
from me so as an attacker uh these are

1007
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,240
obviously something that i want to pop

1008
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,240
and do some fun stuff with say i pop an

1009
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,280
inverter

1010
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,040
what sort of damage can i do or is it

1011
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,599
only in numbers where i can sort of have

1012
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,920
an impact i think realistically it's

1013
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,560
numbers um

1014
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,280
you could i mean locally you could um if

1015
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,280
it was a local area of the grid you

1016
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,720
could uh

1017
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,280
you could force you know you could

1018
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,800
force a brown out

1019
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,720
first force some substations to trip

1020
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,320
which would sort of affect the localized

1021
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,400
supply in that area

1022
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,480
and particular inverters you know of a

1023
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,480
particular you know manufacturer or

1024
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,880
whatever you know you might end up

1025
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,640
being able to

1026
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,560
uh blow up a few appliances here and

1027
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,240
there in the house

1028
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,280
fair enough so you're saying the best

1029
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,960
way to impact the grid is still the old

1030
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,960
explosives at the substation uh

1031
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:03,119
absolutely yeah all right cool um so we

1032
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,480
have got a couple of questions that have

1033
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,160
come through the app so we'll go through

1034
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,400
those first uh simon you had a couple of

1035
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,400
questions

1036
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,440
basically we have an msp situation where

1037
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:22,560
you've got the installers uh the vpps

1038
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,240
all of them have back end access and i

1039
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,480
have two different systems and four

1040
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,680
inverters

1041
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,839
uh that currently have this and i note

1042
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,520
that people get in there and they update

1043
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,960
the firmware and i go no oh you've

1044
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,400
updated the firmware oh we've changed

1045
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,720
how the battery is operating suddenly

1046
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,000
we're not using it the vpp is using it

1047
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,320
now that's fine in inverted commas

1048
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,400
within the contracts

1049
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,079
but how are you going to secure those

1050
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,560
msps because i know some of those don't

1051
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,000
even understand why you wouldn't use

1052
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
wi-fi and why you'd want to plug via

1053
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,920
cat5 cable that took me an hour's

1054
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,760
argument is like no you're you're

1055
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,760
running cable and plugging it in how are

1056
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,920
we going to secure that environment

1057
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,800
because

1058
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,480
that's where your main attack is going

1059
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,079
to come to get the numbers yeah

1060
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:08,560
yeah look great question um that's why

1061
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,640
the title is um to only talks about

1062
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,119
threats not securing it

1063
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,760
but but but yeah so it's um

1064
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,800
i i suspect that that um

1065
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,079
that players and if you're going to

1066
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:22,960
aggregate uh and over time that there

1067
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,520
will be some standards to maintain a

1068
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,160
minimum baseline um and those you know

1069
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,920
if you've got multiple users of the

1070
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,359
battery

1071
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:32,640
um

1072
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:34,480
and it's it's going to be even more and

1073
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,839
more important as we start to get more

1074
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:38,560
and more evs around because you know ev

1075
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,920
is not something that's just connected

1076
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,440
to your house so

1077
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,839
there's some mobility stuff that needs

1078
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:46,160
to happen there as well but um but yeah

1079
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,839
look it's um i think sort of i think

1080
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,200
there will be a need to mandate some

1081
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,200
baselines um

1082
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,960
i think that esb is aware that something

1083
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,800
needs to be done in that area

1084
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,119
um

1085
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,040
and i think you know really it's it's

1086
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,119
not the security controls piece of it

1087
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:04,160
isn't rocket science um we've been doing

1088
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,040
some of this stuff for a long time so

1089
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,599
they just have to do it yeah yeah

1090
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,119
and you know the only the only other

1091
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,280
thing is um

1092
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,760
i would hope that

1093
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,280
that the market

1094
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,960
might actually start to differentiate

1095
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,960
itself so if you've got

1096
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,000
some providers out there that are taking

1097
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
security seriously and have got a really

1098
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,920
good digital interface and good support

1099
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,920
and whatever else like that

1100
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,040
maybe

1101
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,040
they're currently getting penalized

1102
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,720
sorry i'll start again they're currently

1103
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,119
getting penalized because to do that

1104
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,119
it's costing them more so they're coming

1105
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:42,240
in at slightly higher price now i paid

1106
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,359
10 12 more than i could have to get

1107
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,599
exactly the same gear because i went

1108
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,040
with the supplier where i actually had

1109
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,079
good conversations around the

1110
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,160
architecture and the i knew they kind of

1111
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,240
got it versus the hey can we sell you a

1112
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,040
solar system yeah right and you want but

1113
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,320
that's actually going to

1114
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,280
hurt them

1115
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,880
unless we put in something like you know

1116
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,000
27 0001 for installers where you go you

1117
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,640
must do all of this to get your cec

1118
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,960
license or something like that yep

1119
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,280
yep no i look i completely agree

1120
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,040
somebody has to there has to be a

1121
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,520
mandate of a baseline of capability to

1122
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:16,960
raise the bar to start with and then we

1123
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,720
can once we have a bar we don't have a

1124
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,079
bar so once we've got a bar when we can

1125
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:25,040
aim higher than the bar

1126
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,280
unfortunately we're out of time for

1127
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,640
questions i know there were a few people

1128
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,720
in the audience who had some more so are

1129
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,480
you able to take questions after you

1130
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,960
talk sure yeah or send me an email or

1131
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,920
whatever

1132
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,400
um it's in the app all right fantastic

1133
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,000
uh yeah so ask those questions through

1134
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,480
the app um i believe you can answer the

1135
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,760
questions directly through the app as

1136
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,240
well cool okay yeah so uh please give it

1137
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,170
up for dave

1138
00:39:47,170 --> 00:39:51,989
[Applause]

1139
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,640
is okay

1140
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,720
we'll be starting off the next talk in a

1141
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,040
couple of minutes
