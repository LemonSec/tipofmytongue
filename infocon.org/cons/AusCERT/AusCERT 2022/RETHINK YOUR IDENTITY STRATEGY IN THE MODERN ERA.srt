talking about rethinking your identity

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,520
strategy and how to determine what

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,279
security is enough security or have you

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,279

so yes i'm jonathan neal i'm the vice

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,280
president of solution engineering for

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,399
savian

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,160
i've now been saving for about five and

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,760
a half years but in total i've been

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,520
working in the identity and governance

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,559
arena

21
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,719
probably for about 22 years so i've seen

22
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,320
a lot of change

23
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,039
in that time a lot of evolution in terms

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,440
of application ecosystems and a lot of

25
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,360
evolution in terms of

26
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,199
security challenges cyber security

27
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,280
challenges and of course regulatory

28
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,920
compliance and how that impacts

29
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,000
our roles as security professionals and

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,959
how we address those types of challenges

31
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,520
so it's fantastic to be at all cert

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,200
it's also fantastic to be doing

33
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,200
in-person events again

34
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,880
i think if you're all like me i got

35
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,880
tired of doing webinars after the first

36
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,119
six months of the covered lockdown

37
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,040
so it's a refreshing change to be

38
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,320
actually

39
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,680
able to meet and talk to people in

40
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,680
person

41
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,960
okay so in this session what i'll be

42
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,280
talking about is some of the strategies

43
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,560
that you can employ to rethink your

44
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,479
identity governance strategies for the

45
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:35,360
modern enterprise

46
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,479
so before we do that we'll just take a

47
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,360
recap really on just looking back at

48
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,640
what are some of the aspects that are

49
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,320
causing those concerns or causing these

50
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,320
challenges so looking at how the

51
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,960
evolving cyber security landscape has

52
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,880
affected the roles that we have the role

53
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,600
we play and also the types of tools and

54
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,680
processes that we need to deploy in

55
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,799
order to

56
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,320
ensure that our customers or our

57
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,520
partners

58
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,759
are staying safe

59
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,520
once we've done that we'll then start to

60
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,040
look at some of the strategies to

61
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,598
rethink and redefine your iga strategy

62
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,280
how do we reskill

63
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,040
how do we reskill

64
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,800
your environment

65
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,080
so that you can address some of these

66
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,160
new concerns and of course how do you

67
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,360
reboot

68
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,200
how do you start fresh how do you start

69
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,520
taking the new way of thinking the new

70
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,080
way of developing the skills and the

71
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,239
platforms that you have at your disposal

72
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,400
to reboot your iga strategy so it's fit

73
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,519
for the modern enterprise

74
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,440
their business is changing and i think

75
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,840
in the last few years um sometimes due

76
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,440
to covered business has actually changed

77
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,760
at a more rapid pace than we've ever

78
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,519
seen before

79
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,360
and we've seen a huge explosion in the

80
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,200
number of digital first or digital

81
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,680
transformation programs

82
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,680
and that's introduced a lot of new it

83
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,120
challenges and a lot of a lot of new

84
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,480
cyber security challenges

85
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,080
it's also had the knock-on effect that

86
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,319
what it's done is introduced a whole

87
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,640
another set of identities that we need

88
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,120
to manage and govern within the

89
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,640
enterprise

90
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,159
whether that's

91
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,879
employees contractors partners the

92
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,800
supply chain

93
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,800
rpa iot devices workloads identities are

94
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,319
everywhere

95
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,720
so now it really is the right time to

96
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,319
start looking at rethinking your ij

97
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,920
strategy

98
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,280
but what are some of the challenges

99
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,920
for me targeted attacks

100
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,080
often compromise

101
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,799
um you know mismanaged identity

102
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,440
scenarios now whether that is just poor

103
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,440
or weak password management or password

104
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,720
hygiene

105
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,080
whether that is ungoverned or unmanaged

106
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,560
supply chain user accounts

107
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,080
or whether it's of course privileged

108
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,239
identities that remain within your

109
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,080
systems with standing privileges that

110
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,760
are often excessive

111
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,920
at a great way for an attacker to enter

112
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,560
your network and move laterally across

113
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,040
and we've seen loads of examples where

114
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,640
privileged identity particularly has

115
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,159
been exploited

116
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,319
to cause not only business disruption

117
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,560
but also financial losses and maybe

118
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,920
we'll cover some of those as we go

119
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,159
through

120
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,560
so some interesting statistics there was

121
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,238
a recent survey

122
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,120
um

123
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,479
and the survey returned 79 of the

124
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,720
organizations within that survey

125
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,960
admitted that they'd had some kind of

126
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,759
identity related breach within the last

127
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,360
two years

128
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,280
now that's a pretty frightening prospect

129
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,440
79 of those organizations

130
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,759
but i also think what's more critical is

131
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,280
the fact that 99 of those organizations

132
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,520
believed that their identity related

133
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,080
breaches were absolutely preventable

134
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,400
but what's the impact of just doing

135
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,440
nothing

136
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,000
let's understand that

137
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,199
well we talked about breaches and

138
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,120
breaches are devastating to any

139
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,880
organization

140
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,800
whether it's in terms of audit findings

141
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,400
or audit failures

142
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,400
fighting financial impact or

143
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,560
reputational damage or of course

144
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,600
business disruption

145
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,520
but i actually think some of the root

146
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,520
causes the fact that the tools that are

147
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,880
currently deployed in a lot of

148
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,400
organizations

149
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,160
are either out of date

150
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,400
too expensive too costly to own and

151
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,639
operate properly and are effectively

152
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,280
wholly ineffective at dealing with a

153
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,320
modern set of threats

154
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,240
so if you stop for a moment and you

155
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,639
reflect on this huge explosion in the

156
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,400
numbers of different types of identities

157
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,919
that you manage

158
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,400
plus the risk

159
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,160
that you introduce to your organization

160
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,759
by not managing those identities

161
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,120
appropriately

162
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,080
you can

163
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,080
really see the size of both the

164
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,840
challenge and opportunity that lays

165
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,159
ahead

166
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,240
so how do we start to rethink our iga

167
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,400
strategy how do we start to sort of

168
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,639
remap what it is that's important to us

169
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,400
and how we can implement the proper

170
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,319
tooling and the proper controls to

171
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,080
ensure that we are governing and

172
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,758
managing our identities appropriately

173
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,680
so we need a new way we need a new way

174
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,440
to manage all of these different types

175
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,199
of identities within our environment and

176
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,720
we talked about our customers our

177
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,360
partners our employees our privileged

178
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,000
accounts and our workloads

179
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,440
but also the actual application

180
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,280
landscape or the platform landscape has

181
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,280
changed significantly over the last few

182
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,880
years as well

183
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,639
so you need a tool that's flexible

184
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,520
enough

185
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,600
and scalable enough to also be able to

186
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,280
onboard some of your

187
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,120
businesses most critical applications

188
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,880
and infrastructure

189
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,039
whether that is data infrastructure as a

190
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,720
service running in single cloud

191
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,919
multi-cloud

192
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,639
whether it's your core erp platforms

193
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,639
financial systems

194
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,160
or new sas applications and

195
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,080
collaboration tools these things

196
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,800
exploded over covid where you had to

197
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,319
start doing more collaboration with

198
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,360
people

199
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,800
through different tools like microsoft

200
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,639
teams for example

201
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:09,680
and of course if you're in the

202
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,520
healthcare space then it's really

203
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,759
important for you to be able to manage

204
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,759
who has access to some of those

205
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:19,039
electronic healthcare records

206
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,080
so looking at how do i

207
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,759
onboard more applications how do i

208
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,160
manage more applications how do i

209
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,080
onboard and manage

210
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,039
you know more identities is really key

211
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,400
to be able to drive a 360 degree view

212
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,280
across your organization in terms of who

213
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,599
has access to what

214
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,240
is that access being used appropriately

215
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,199
and what does that access really mean

216
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,720
putting someone in an ad group could

217
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,639
have implications beyond your wildest

218
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,599
dreams

219
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:51,759
it could give someone full control over

220
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,440
all of your ec2 instances running in

221
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,199
your aws cloud

222
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,120
right so it's a really important factor

223
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,039
to be able to

224
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:00,879
recognize that information and be able

225
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,639
to put the right security controls

226
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,759
around it

227
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,479
so you can manage your identities you

228
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,240
can secure your business critical

229
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,840
applications

230
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,360
and of course once we start doing this

231
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,360
we can also put in processes to start

232
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,080
automating some responses or automating

233
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,719
some processes

234
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,240
so i like to think about this

235
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,319
this diagram and

236
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,160
i kind of envision myself sitting in the

237
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,840
dark trying to complete a thousand piece

238
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,919
jigsaw puzzle

239
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,399
it's pretty impossible

240
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,080
but if you now think about this in terms

241
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,839
of all of these identities all of these

242
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,320
applications all these infrastructure

243
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,080
what we're now looking at is actually a

244
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,760
puzzle that's hundreds of thousands of

245
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,679
pieces

246
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,279
and the problem is you don't necessarily

247
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,959
have a good idea or understanding of

248
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,320
what that final picture is actually

249
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,760
going to look like

250
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,160
so you take that problem and you magnify

251
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,839
it many many times over

252
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,519
so what is it we can do to help

253
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,040
drive some

254
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,080
clarity from that chaos that we see

255
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,560
and the way that we do that today is by

256
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,279
using modern capabilities like machine

257
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,720
learning

258
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,080
intelligence analytical controls

259
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,240
which really does help an organization

260
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,399
implement better automation and whether

261
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,120
that is managing our user journey from a

262
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,600
life cycle management perspective

263
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,360
how can i give them

264
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,480
most of what they need day one

265
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,640
but also what happens if i need

266
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,160
my user to

267
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,240
request additional access discretionary

268
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,959
access how do i make that process

269
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:41,279
more streamlined how do i make it

270
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,120
predictive how do i tell the user what

271
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,040
it is based on their relationship with

272
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
my organization what it is they should

273
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,040
be requesting

274
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,480
and of course how do i make sure that

275
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,240
what that person is requesting isn't

276
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,240
actually going to introduce new risk

277
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,959
into my organization whether that is by

278
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,120
granting them access to critical

279
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,440
applications or creating segregation of

280
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,200
duties which could cause

281
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,560
financial

282
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,760
fraud or just audit findings

283
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,200
so we're managing the lifecycle of these

284
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,360
identities and obviously events is

285
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,880
something that naturally occurs through

286
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,360
the life cycle of an identity so how do

287
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,040
we make sure when that user changes

288
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,200
their role it could be going from a

289
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,440
contractor to an employee it could be

290
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,360
going from sales to marketing it could

291
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,760
be coming becoming from an individual

292
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,760
contributor to a manager how do we make

293
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,200
sure that we are

294
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,959
right sizing the access that they need

295
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,399
based on that new role

296
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,079
and we're not introducing additional

297
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:36,800
levels of risk

298
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,040
so this isn't

299
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,680
just something that can be done with

300
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:45,600
iga alone right we need to leverage

301
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,720
different

302
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,399
avenues or different facets to provide

303
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,079
some additional information as to how we

304
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,160
manage that journey

305
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,519
so thinking about intelligence and

306
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,839
analytics how can we leverage peer group

307
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,519
analytics

308
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,440
how can we look at what are other people

309
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,560
that have the same set of

310
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,959
characteristics as me

311
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,640
or the same sets of attributes as me

312
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,560
what do they have what does their access

313
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,040
look like what is the level of coherence

314
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,800
can i use that to make more predictive

315
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,640
experience on behalf of my user

316
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,640
absolutely

317
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,760
can i use things like historical trends

318
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,200
what have other people requested in the

319
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,120
past was it successful was it approved

320
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,640
was it rejected

321
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,480
so can i leverage those insights again

322
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,880
to help me make more informed decisions

323
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,200
as an approver as to whether i should

324
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,640
grant that access to those users or not

325
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,959
and as i mentioned

326
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,880
one of the key things here is not

327
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,560
introducing additional levels of risk so

328
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,040
what other things can i leverage within

329
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,760
my iga ecosystem to help make those

330
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,839
better decisions and better automation

331
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,360
whether it is

332
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,920
grc type integration segregation of duty

333
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,600
checks before i'm granting the access

334
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,839
whether it is leveraging information

335
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,519
that's coming from a user behavioral

336
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,639
analytics technology or a seam system to

337
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,360
provide more real-time more contextual

338
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,600
based risk

339
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,600
and of course one of the last pieces of

340
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,120
the puzzle is just to make sure that

341
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,360
when that user's journey within the

342
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,360
organization finishes that we've got to

343
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,279
make sure that we are removing those

344
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,519
accesses we're making sure that we are

345
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,040
staying clean from a governance

346
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,120
perspective we are not

347
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,760
um you know increasing the size of

348
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,720
our attack surface by leaving accounts

349
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,920
um

350
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,160
unmanaged ungoverned

351
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,000
when the user or the owning identity is

352
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,240
moved on from the organization

353
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,160
so again better automation

354
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,240
better life cycle management better risk

355
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,839
control better visibility

356
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:48,800
so

357
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,680
if you

358
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,560
think about that from an ij perspective

359
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:53,600
think about all the things that are

360
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,600
possible to do then it is possible to

361
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,920
start conquering some of these identity

362
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,200
challenges

363
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,720
and it could be all of the above it

364
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,480
could be just a subset of these maybe

365
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,000
you just want to

366
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,040
modernize a legacy iga or pam solution

367
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:08,880
maybe you've got a problem managing your

368
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:12,399
supply chain your third parties

369
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,000
or maybe it's achieving continuous

370
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,920
compliance controls

371
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,079
highly regulated financial systems

372
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,600
so these can all be done when you start

373
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,519
looking at iga

374
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:25,279
more holistically looking at your

375
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,440
applications more holistically and how

376
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,440
you manage those access the days of

377
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,600
having individual silos

378
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,560
of grc technologies of provisioning

379
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,279
technologies of pam technologies you

380
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,199
know are really a thing of the past and

381
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,480
they're the things that introduce risk

382
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,160
and latency

383
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,600
and

384
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,880
can cause identity mismanagement

385
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,279
so how do we

386
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,839
reskill we're rethinking our iga we

387
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,440
understand what the problem is the risk

388
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,720
is of having all these unmanaged and

389
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,040
ungoverned identities the risk of not

390
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,560
incorporating all of our applications

391
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,680
into our

392
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:05,279
new iga ecosystem

393
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,360
i always say re-skilling is about people

394
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,839
processing technology in that order

395
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,519
so certainly you've got to do an amount

396
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,199
of re-skilling

397
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,040
in terms of what is possible with a

398
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,519
modern iga technology what's changing in

399
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,600
terms of industry best practice what's

400
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,360
happening in terms of

401
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,199
the direction that the industry is going

402
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,839
let's get rid of that

403
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,079
so pick on a couple of things right um

404
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,880
and i mentioned um some

405
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,120
major high-profile attacks

406
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,880
um that caused untold damage and

407
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,240
business disruption to a number of

408
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,160
organizations in europe and in north

409
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,000
america particularly in the last couple

410
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,120
of years

411
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,000
and one of the things that they're

412
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,760
looking to

413
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,519
do as an outcome

414
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,680
of these types of challenges is to move

415
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,839
towards more of a zero trust identity

416
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,360
model

417
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,320
and if we think about that in the

418
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,600
context of pam it's quite

419
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,519
straightforward right

420
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,360
traditional pam vendors

421
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,040
they go off they scan all the privileged

422
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,560
identities in your

423
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,560
in your data center

424
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,320
and they put them in a vault and then

425
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,680
they put some services around which

426
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,279
allows you to check in check out and

427
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,120
rotate password

428
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,839
that's not actually solving the problem

429
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,480
it's just centralizing the problem

430
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,199
you haven't reduced your attack surface

431
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,360
so you haven't necessarily implemented

432
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,880
anything that's going to drive real

433
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,959
security benefits so a lot of our

434
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,880
customers are now looking at a new

435
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,600
approach how do we manage pam

436
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,440
differently how do we do this based on

437
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,279
more of a just in time

438
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,839
just enough

439
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,519
approach how do i request access to a

440
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,680
privileged resource

441
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,199
with privileges

442
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,639
would allow me to perform certain

443
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,399
functions

444
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,480
only when i need it

445
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,320
only as much as i need

446
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,000
and of course how do i make sure that

447
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
when i finish doing that activity that

448
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,240
that information is actually removed

449
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,519
and we'll talk about some of that in a

450
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,839
second

451
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,360
but if you think about identity you

452
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,880
think about governance privilege you've

453
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,800
got to be able to adapt to changes as

454
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,240
we've said we've seen unprecedented

455
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,079
changes in the last two years alone the

456
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,920
explosion of digital transformation the

457
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,240
explosion of the numbers of identities

458
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,000
the types of applications and systems

459
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,920
and platforms

460
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,279
so being agile with an ij program

461
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,120
you know is again paramount to

462
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,079
successful implementation not taking

463
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,920
uh you know two months to onboard a new

464
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,600
application by which time you know

465
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,120
there's maybe another application or

466
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,560
another release or something else that's

467
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,160
come on to take its place

468
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,320
and we talked a lot about automation um

469
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,440
you know automating additional decisions

470
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,120
um not just from uh should this person

471
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,120
have access to something

472
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,519
but what about if i'm doing something

473
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,160
that i believe is not necessarily within

474
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,639
the best interests of my organization

475
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,639
what about if it is something

476
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,240
that is outside the remit of what that

477
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,320
person subscribed to doing as they

478
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
executed a privileged session so how do

479
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,880
we make automated decisions in terms of

480
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,400
removing that access

481
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,880
shutting down that session automatically

482
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,400
based on certain risk signatures

483
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,319
and of course how do i bring more

484
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,359
context to risk

485
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,640
i think one of the things actually i'll

486
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,919
show this on the next slide because it's

487
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,160
probably easier to describe this so if

488
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,679
you think about this from

489
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,599
uh harnessing the power of identity

490
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,039
today and harnessing the power of

491
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,679
additional providers we're extending the

492
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,200
visibility we're extending the risk

493
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,720
profile

494
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,640
to different avenues yes we're managing

495
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,480
all of our identities

496
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,559
across the top right there

497
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,240
and we're feeding that into our risk

498
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,120
engine within our ij solution which

499
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,120
allows us to make intelligent decisions

500
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,559
based on access requests on

501
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,720
certification campaigns on risk

502
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,520
management and so on

503
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,039
but what about if i could tell you about

504
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,080
something

505
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,440
even more

506
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,960
powerful than making those types of

507
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,039
decisions

508
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,240
what if i'm a salesforce user um and i

509
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,360
have

510
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,919
because of my role as a vp of sales i

511
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,400
have the ability to export my customer

512
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,080
list

513
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,400
it's in my role right i have access to

514
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,960
the customer list what if i was able to

515
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,720
tell you that for the last two weeks

516
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,320
that person's been

517
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,039
on job sites

518
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,480
would you make a different decision as

519
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,400
to whether you allowed that operation to

520
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,280
happen

521
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,160
based on that additional risk context

522
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,200
right absolutely

523
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,440
what if i'm requesting access as a

524
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,360
devsecops guy right i own the

525
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,480
infrastructure that's running in my

526
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,840
cloud service

527
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,679
and my role is to

528
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,760
manage this i have privileged access to

529
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,080
a lot of my services

530
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,480
so for me accessing a particular service

531
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,080
isn't necessarily a risk in itself or it

532
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,440
wouldn't be an easy

533
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,520
easy to identify risk because the risk

534
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,960
doesn't actually exist with me as the

535
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,160
person

536
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,640
the risk doesn't actually exist with the

537
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,960
operation that i'm trying to undertake

538
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,640
the risk is actually what i'm trying to

539
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,760
access

540
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,440
so what if we can

541
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,600
tell you that the service that that

542
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,840
person is requesting access to

543
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,640
is compromised it hasn't been patched it

544
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,919
has open ssh ports open rdp ports

545
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,520
unencrypted disks attached to that

546
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,440
workload would you make a different

547
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,280
decision as to whether you allowed

548
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,240
access

549
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,200
to that endpoint given that information

550
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,919
absolutely you would

551
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,919
so when we talk about

552
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,120
leveraging different risk contexts

553
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,679
we think about a wider

554
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:34,480
risk

555
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,240
set of risk providers that are common in

556
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,320
your in your ecosystem again breaking

557
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,240
down some of those silos and being able

558
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,799
to drive more value

559
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:44,480
by getting in more contextual more

560
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,120
real-time risk analysis

561
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,120
so some of the pillars um of success for

562
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,080
a converged iga platform from my past my

563
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,520
perspective

564
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,280
i think first of all extensibility

565
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,600
looking for a platform that you can

566
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,720
start with a set of use cases

567
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,039
maybe it's on iga maybe it's automation

568
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,559
maybe it is third-party access

569
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,320
management

570
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,200
but as and when you mature

571
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,280
as and when you evolve that ij strategy

572
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,960
how do i

573
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,320
provide more services without disruption

574
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,080
without heavy lifting without more

575
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,799
coding without different integrations

576
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,159
so i'm looking for a platform that will

577
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,799
allow me to start and address my

578
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,039
immediate business goals but also to be

579
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,440
able to quickly adopt new modules new

580
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,919
features to address the business goals

581
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,360
or the it goals of the future

582
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,640
built in the cloud fast time to value

583
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,159
i mentioned in my introduction i've

584
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,600
spent 22 years doing iga so i've been

585
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,159
through the whole pain of

586
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:54,960
um

587
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,720
heritage legacy whatever you want to

588
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,440
call it in terms of iga on-prem where it

589
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,600
takes you six months to do the sizing of

590
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,960
the hardware work out which os

591
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,559
you need to run to be supported across

592
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,159
all these platforms building the

593
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,880
platform acquiring the technologies it

594
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,320
takes six months so what have you done

595
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,600
you've achieved nothing other than build

596
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,080
a platform

597
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,919
and in my time there were so many

598
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,080
different iga programs that reached the

599
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,000
18 month point and the only achievement

600
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,080
that actually happened

601
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,600
was the fact that they had onboarded a

602
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,679
handful of applications

603
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,360
for provisioning and they had

604
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,840
implemented password reset

605
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,720
fantastic right an i.t tool for an i.t

606
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:35,840
job

607
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,760
so again the whole business landscape

608
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,679
has completely changed it's a business

609
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,280
enablement tool it's an

610
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,440
agile tool that allows you to

611
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,080
immediately sorry allows you to move at

612
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,919
the speed of business

613
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:49,440
right rather than restricting the speed

614
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,520
of business and without compromise to

615
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:55,120
security or regulatory compliance

616
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,880
so built in the cloud fast time to value

617
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,960
configuration and not code all of these

618
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,039
things are high on my agenda when i'm

619
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,240
looking at

620
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,080
rebooting or rethinking my iga

621
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,240
best-in-class service engagement model

622
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,679
you know that's really important i need

623
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:12,960
experts people that have been there

624
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,159
people that have done this people that

625
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,960
have addressed these types of problems

626
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,559
in the past

627
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,000
because

628
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,720
this is not about having java developers

629
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,559
or net developers

630
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,280
right deployed for your iga program

631
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,799
this is about business and risk

632
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,480
consulting

633
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,159
so

634
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,760
you know the people that you need in

635
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,679
order to help build that center of

636
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,600
excellence within any enterprise you

637
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,039
know has really kind of shifted from

638
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,720
deep technology

639
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,640
to yes obviously you still have to have

640
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,640
that grasp of technology but you need to

641
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,480
be able to translate what the business

642
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,640
is requiring what internal audit

643
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,320
function is requiring

644
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,400
you know what the cfo is

645
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,760
needing

646
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,640
from

647
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:58,080
let's say an sod perspective

648
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,480
and operational excellence absolutely

649
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,400
being able to

650
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,480
have a platform that is

651
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,480
more scalable

652
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,600
more resilient more secure than anything

653
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,559
that you've built in your data center

654
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,400
you know how many data center people

655
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,799
have their own sock too type 2 iso

656
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,720
270017

657
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,039
fedramp certifications

658
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,640
so the whole block is the whole

659
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,240
challenges of moving to the cloud oh

660
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,679
it's my data it's in the cloud it's not

661
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,520
secure i mean that's not that's not

662
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,640
correct

663
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,159
you're looking at these platforms now

664
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,280
that are

665
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,240
very very well secured very well

666
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,320
certified you know and this is an annual

667
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,400
process to maintain these certifications

668
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,919
and again that is everything from people

669
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,520
process technology

670
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,200
who are you hiring what is the

671
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,799
background check what are they going to

672
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,480
be doing for you

673
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,760
right all these things become really

674
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,679
really important and is that a headache

675
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,039
that you want to

676
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,120
maintain yourself running on-prem

677
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,480
running all these servers running all

678
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,720
this real estate keeping the lights

679
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,520
watered keeping upgrades done

680
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,840
right not focusing on how do i actually

681
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,159
work with the business to provide you

682
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:07,760
know a more efficient iga process

683
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,240
so we think about rebooting

684
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,760
so we now

685
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,520
understand what the problem landscape is

686
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,360
we know that we've got to rethink things

687
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,640
we've got to do things in a slightly

688
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,480
different way and we know that we've got

689
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,880
to be ready to re-skill

690
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,840
based on the way that we're going to

691
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,880
address some of these issues

692
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,880
so what about what's happening in terms

693
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,640
of

694
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,720
the industry so again

695
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,720
there are um

696
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,480
there's been a number of uh

697
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,159
surveys and things that that happen

698
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,480
frequently and gartner are a major

699
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,080
provider or source of these types of

700
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:44,960
things

701
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,080
so in a recent survey a year or so ago

702
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,360
people were asked what is the most

703
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,039
important thing in the future of a

704
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:54,799
converged iam or ij platform

705
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,520
52 that's the majority what a platform

706
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,559
that meets all of their requirements

707
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,919
they don't want to employ java

708
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,520
developers.net developers to do this

709
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,720
kind of stuff anymore they want

710
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,039
something that will give them outbox

711
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,919
exactly what it is they need

712
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,919
27 said

713
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:15,279
you know i'm happy to um have some

714
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:17,200
misses i'm happy not to cover everything

715
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,960
that i need but i actually want to what

716
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,200
i need is a tool a broader tool that's

717
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:24,000
going to allow me to do more with less

718
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,480
so whether that is converging

719
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,720
grc with iga or whether that's

720
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,440
converging pam with iga or third-party

721
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,480
access governance with iga

722
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,720
and 21 said the most important thing for

723
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,360
them is a sas delivered model

724
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,880
so these are just some insights that you

725
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,840
might want to take away

726
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,960
market

727
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,440
predictions uh 45

728
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,440
of respondents said

729
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,679
um you know that they were looking for a

730
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,679
converged platform that was one of the

731
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,200
most important things

732
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,240
for them uh incredibly eighty-four

733
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,320
percent

734
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,640
of people said that they were looking uh

735
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,480
first shifter cloud and whether that is

736
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,679
iga whether that is ig uh and pam

737
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,240
whether that's just pam standalone

738
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,919
so to meet the demands of cloud you've

739
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,360
got to be in the cloud you've got to be

740
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,640
born and architected in the cloud

741
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,480
and of course not everybody is at the

742
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,480
same level of maturity

743
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,480
so it's okay right

744
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,919
we all have a different starting point

745
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:25,520
we all have a different journey

746
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:27,679
with which to get to our end point so it

747
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,679
could just be that you know your main

748
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:31,279
priority is building in better

749
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,400
automation

750
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,400
using analytics to drive better decision

751
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,679
making so i can make sure i'm

752
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,919
provisioning my day one users with the

753
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,080
right access that they need to be

754
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,080
effective and efficient from day one

755
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,880
so

756
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,840
just to finish off

757
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,799
introducing

758
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,039
the market leading number one uh

759
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,159
converged identity platform

760
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,400
being able to onboard any application

761
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,440
any infrastructure any identity any

762
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,400
cloud

763
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,320
and being able to deliver services

764
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,559
across those identities

765
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:13,679
such as identity governance

766
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,200
administration

767
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,440
privileged access management

768
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,480
third cut third-party governance

769
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,640
application grc

770
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,600
and data protection

771
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,440
i forgot an end slide my apologies

772
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,840
so i really in summary i really hope

773
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,000
that you found some aspects of

774
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,200
that

775
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,440
interesting or at least informative and

776
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,520
of course if you want to come back and

777
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,240
learn anything more about savian

778
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,600
then obviously we're going to be in the

779
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,120
main expo area

780
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,640
so i'm happy to take any questions if

781
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,320
we've got any uh

782
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,960
couple of minutes left

783
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,039
or i can take some questions back at the

784
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,279
booth

785
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,480
they don't seem to be any questions from

786
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,960
the audience either locally or remote so

787
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:03,840
um

788
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,559
if everybody could uh please thank

789
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,240
the speaker on behalf of the conference

790
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,679
oh thank you very much

791
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,440
thanks everyone

792
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,279
so we've got a 14-minute break until the

793
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,240
next session the next one in here that

794
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,919
was i was looking at just a moment ago

795
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:20,000
there we go um what the bad guys are

796
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,559
looking for cloud misconfigurations

797
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,559
so that could be interesting so anyway

798
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,640
all right
