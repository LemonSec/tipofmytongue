good afternoon everyone um i am giving a

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,800
talk on xero trust uh what does it

19
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,320
actually mean i'm pretty sure we've all

20
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,800
heard xero trust banded about a couple

21
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,280
of times today alone i think i've seen

22
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,840
at least three or four talks with xero

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,320
trust in the title um so for those who

24
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,640
don't know me i am jess dodson i am a

25
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,720
customer engineer with microsoft

26
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,360
focusing on security and identity

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,840
now please bear with me i am likely

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,520
going to need to take drinks of water

29
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,080
and sip throughout the session

30
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,920
i wrote my talk and then stupidly went

31
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,680
and got covered which was a really good

32
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,159
idea um so i haven't rehearsed it as

33
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,360
much as i'd like so i'm going to be

34
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,200
referring to my notes so please be kind

35
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,320
and gentle

36
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,119
um

37
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,759
i am a purple head recovering system

38
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,720
administrator now a security engineer so

39
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,680
i help people and customers

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,479
try and improve their security usually

41
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,439
by yelling quite loudly so some of you

42
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,680
may have been on in some of my sessions

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,360
previously i did one last year on

44
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,680
security basics i love yelling about the

45
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,799
basics

46
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:49,680
and this one is all about zero trust

47
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,280
because it's one of the things that i

48
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,520
seem to be talking a lot about

49
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,399
it is the buzzword of the moment

50
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,799
everyone's banding it about um but if

51
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,880
you mention it to management or to

52
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,200
operation staff they're kind of like

53
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,520
zero

54
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,759
um no joke most of the organizations

55
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,479
that i go into they know the words xero

56
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,000
and trust but they don't actually know

57
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,319
what it means so we need to do a much

58
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,840
better job of explaining what xero trust

59
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,720
is

60
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,959
how it applies to our environments our

61
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,239
organizations and how we access and use

62
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,319
the technology we have

63
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,040
and so i wrote this talk um

64
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,000
it is quite dry content so

65
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,760
yes i have put lots of memes through it

66
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,040
because you've got to kind of spice the

67
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,120
content up

68
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,120
so zero trust

69
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,400
what does it boil down to

70
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,720
this

71
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,560
really

72
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,080
um i mean it's in the title right zero

73
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,360
trust no trust trust no one

74
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,239
it makes sense

75
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,120
not quite um and i think that's what

76
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,000
makes

77
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,080
zero trust and the whole idea of zero

78
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,800
trust with the title of xero trust a bit

79
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,120
tricky to explain um and i'm not just

80
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,800
talking about explaining it to end users

81
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,879
although explaining it to them can be

82
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,239
hard

83
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,560
but i'm talking about explaining it to

84
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,239
our management and even to our own

85
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,280
operational staff about how we go about

86
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,840
implementing xero trust across our

87
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,920
technologies solutions the policies

88
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,360
we're looking at putting in place the

89
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,799
governance we're looking at putting in

90
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,560
place

91
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,080
and a lot of the time i think it's just

92
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,560
as confusing to us as well

93
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,120
so when i'm talking to my customers who

94
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,959
are for the most part security

95
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,239
operations folks security architects um

96
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,480
identity administrators um the

97
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,319
occasional sys admin who's dabbling

98
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,440
across into security no one has a really

99
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,840
good idea of what it is from a big

100
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,319
picture and i think that's part of the

101
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,200
problem

102
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,159
so how can we expect our users or more

103
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,000
importantly our management who are going

104
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,519
to be coughing up the dollars to be able

105
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,120
to put this stuff in place

106
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,159
to understand what it means to be based

107
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,640
on a zero trust architecture if we can't

108
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,200
explain it ourselves

109
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,000
so maybe limited trust would be a better

110
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,959
way

111
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,560
of saying it but

112
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,840
i don't think that sounds quite as

113
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,519
snazzy as zero trust

114
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,000
so if zero trust doesn't boil down to

115
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
trust no one

116
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,160
what does it actually mean

117
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,400
now i went through a large number of

118
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,400
documents so many reference

119
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,639
architectures so many different versions

120
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,400
so many different websites i read

121
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,800
through at least a dozen different

122
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,560
methodologies of what xero trust is in

123
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,280
order to be able to make this talk now

124
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,840
i am a little bit biased yes i do work

125
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,560
for microsoft so i like utilizing some

126
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,199
of their ideas mainly because i talk

127
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,560
about it enough that i could probably do

128
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,280
it in my sleep but i'm also a recovering

129
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,919
identity administrator so their focus on

130
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,720
identity being a really big part of zero

131
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,360
trust is something that i kind of like

132
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,080
so because of that i like the trilogy of

133
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,199
what xero trust is with the focus being

134
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,199
on identity

135
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,320
and i know a lot of you are going to

136
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,560
cringe when i say it but the whole

137
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,080
identity is the new security perimeter

138
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,400
it's kind of true

139
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,080
so that's not to say that i don't love

140
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,800
me

141
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,639
some network segmentation and we will

142
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,360
get to that but for our current new byod

143
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,919
sas pass world

144
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,320
identity is queen

145
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,759
so instead of zero trust being trust no

146
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,520
one it turns into

147
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,880
trust but verify which i really like it

148
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,520
fits better it's almost like limited

149
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,320
trust but it's more explicit in what

150
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,560
we're trying to do um it does sound

151
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,720
better in the original russian um it

152
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,120
rhymes uh but we'll have to make do with

153
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,720
english and i am not going to try and

154
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,080
pronounce it in the original russian

155
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,720
because i will 100 butcher the out

156
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,319
of the pronunciation i'm just not going

157
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:07,199
to do it

158
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,000
so if we're doing trust but verify

159
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,479
how do we go about doing that with the

160
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,919
zero trust trilogy as i call it

161
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,840
so first up

162
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:21,440
verify explicitly nice and short but

163
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,039
what does it mean

164
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,759
every person every user every

165
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,639
authentication request every device

166
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,840
every application every request for data

167
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,400
everything

168
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,919
needs to prove they are who they say

169
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,840
they are we need to verify all of the

170
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:38,720
things

171
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,120
we don't just trust that they say they

172
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,440
are who they say they are as part of the

173
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,039
trust but verify part we're focusing on

174
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,639
that verification

175
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,280
and verifying

176
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,960
explicitly there is no implicit trust

177
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,160
here

178
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,919
and when we talk identities we're not

179
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,400
just talking about user identities we're

180
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,880
talking device identities we're talking

181
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,039
application identities even location

182
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,919
identities it all plays into it we need

183
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,799
to verify it all

184
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,240
now i'm sure you all know this one um

185
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,160
likely that if you've ever heard me talk

186
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,680
before you may have heard me talk about

187
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,360
least privilege once

188
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,160
twice a couple of thousand times

189
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,680
role-based access control is something

190
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,160
very close to my heart um least

191
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,960
privilege is a fundamental part of that

192
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,199
so it's all about your role-based access

193
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,240
controls least privilege give users

194
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,720
the rights they need to do their job no

195
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,599
more

196
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,160
no less i've been preaching about this

197
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,800
for over half of my it career i'm pretty

198
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,280
sure i'm going to be shouting about it

199
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,440
until the end of time

200
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,639
we still can't get this right well um

201
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,560
so until we actually get it right i'm

202
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,080
going to continue shouting

203
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,319
but it is more than just role-based

204
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,840
access control

205
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,120
least privilege is looking at the

206
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,520
privileges for everything you do so it

207
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,360
can look at your least privilege around

208
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,960
your network and your lease privilege

209
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,960
around your data lease privilege around

210
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,039
what applications you're accessing so

211
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,360
we're not just talking about lease

212
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,039
privilege in terms of the way that i

213
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,360
talk about it not everybody needs global

214
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,199
admin rights we're talking about least

215
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,280
privilege across your whole digital

216
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,679
estate

217
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,599
and yes i've said this one before a

218
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,280
couple of times as well so assuming

219
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,479
breach

220
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:29,360
it's almost like some of this was basic

221
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,640
at any given time we have to assume

222
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,519
that

223
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,919
at some time somewhere in our

224
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,240
organization someone is doing something

225
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,320
they're not supposed to be doing now

226
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
that's not to say necessarily that we

227
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,880
have a threat actor in our environment

228
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,880
although we very well could

229
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,240
what we're talking about here is that we

230
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,320
need to structure our environment in

231
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,560
such a way that

232
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,560
there is someone in there we believe

233
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,720
there is someone doing something dodgy

234
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,480
and so we structure our environments in

235
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,160
a way that they can do the least amount

236
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,480
of damage possible limit that blast

237
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,480
radius be it a threat actor doing

238
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,279
something malicious or be it an internal

239
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,680
insider threat doing something malicious

240
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,720
or just

241
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,480
something stupid which is probably more

242
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,360
likely um and this is where we can look

243
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,360
at pulling out our network segmentation

244
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,800
and dusting it off and bringing it back

245
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,000
into the fold because network

246
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,839
segmentation plays into this one as well

247
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,120
so that's great

248
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,720
and we've got these three ideas we've

249
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,760
got

250
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,480
verify explicitly use least privilege

251
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,720
assume breach

252
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,480
that's awesome but what does that

253
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,839
actually mean where we want to go about

254
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,160
applying that to our digital estate to

255
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,080
our infrastructure our environments our

256
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,040
organizations um buzzword bingo is

257
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
fantastic i always love playing a bit of

258
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,600
buzzword bingo myself but having an idea

259
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,920
of what you need to do to put that in

260
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,839
place is the most important part we can

261
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:55,920
talk about the abstracts until we're

262
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,680
blue in the face but unless there is

263
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,720
some concrete things we can do

264
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,279
it's kind of all for naught um so i've

265
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,160
read through a whole bunch of

266
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,920
documentation there's a whole bunch of

267
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,000
fancy stuff there's pages and pages of

268
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,480
it online it is all very tedious and i

269
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,800
fall asleep after about the fourth page

270
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,360
um so i've decided to try and sum up as

271
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,839
much of it as i can in this presentation

272
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,040
and have a little bit of fun with it

273
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,120
because let's be honest zero trust can

274
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,880
be mind-numbingly boring

275
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,360
so we come to the pillars

276
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,360
of your digital estate um there is more

277
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,120
than four but i really like this picture

278
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,800
because yes one of them is likely to

279
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,360
squish you and be like the pain point on

280
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,959
your back so we're going to be talking

281
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,880
about the six pillars

282
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,800
of technology that exist inside of our

283
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,360
organizations and what we need to do to

284
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,880
focus on

285
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,040
implementing zero trust on those

286
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,920
particular pillars

287
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,640
identities of course i'm going to start

288
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,480
with identities because it's my favorite

289
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,320
um first things first we need to use

290
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,240
strong authentication

291
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,160
pretty sure everyone here is tired of me

292
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,000
talking about mfa please just go and

293
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,320
turn it on um strong authentication

294
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,760
isn't just an airy fairy term um mfa is

295
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,680
so important and it shouldn't just be

296
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,839
for your top end users we're talking

297
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,200
everyone

298
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,800
99 of identity related breaches can have

299
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,880
their effectiveness reduced by having

300
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,160
mfa

301
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,760
brute forces can't work if you have mfa

302
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,079
even phishing attacks can't work well if

303
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,519
you have mfa

304
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,399
so turning mfa on for everyone in your

305
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,320
environment is one of the best things

306
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,440
you can do

307
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,160
to put zero trust in place

308
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,920
single sign-on

309
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,839
make it happen

310
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,760
our users let's be honest are going to

311
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,240
try and find the the path of least

312
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,120
resistance they will reuse passwords

313
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,120
okay so if we're utilizing something

314
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,560
like single sign-on they're going to be

315
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,320
using the same username and password no

316
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,800
matter where they are be it in the cloud

317
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,120
or accessing from a device at home or

318
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,040
whether they're in your office so it's

319
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,200
going to make it more secure you're

320
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,279
going to have far more control over that

321
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,560
identity

322
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,920
if you are utilizing single sign-on

323
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,440
look at using some form of privileged

324
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,079
identity or access management um we

325
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,920
don't want rights to be assigned at all

326
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,440
times we don't want users and

327
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,600
administrators to permanently have those

328
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,360
rights we want them to be able to

329
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,680
elevate possibly get some form of

330
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,079
approval involved have those rights and

331
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,560
then have them removed no one should

332
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,239
have permanent rights

333
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,800
creating access policies and you'll hear

334
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
me talk a lot in this talk about access

335
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
policies and procedures access policies

336
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,639
are what's going to underpin

337
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,959
your entire zero trust when it comes to

338
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,920
identity so we want to make sure that

339
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,480
you have policies created for what your

340
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:48,720
users should be doing when they log on

341
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
making sure that they've got mfa turned

342
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,040
on working out where they're coming from

343
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,959
what endpoints they're connecting in

344
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:56,480
from

345
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,000
making sure we're logging all of this

346
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,680
data as well looking for those things

347
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,240
like failed login attempts or monitoring

348
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,800
what times your users are logging in so

349
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,720
a lot of the time when we look at a

350
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,240
standard user they're logging in sort of

351
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,560
between seven and nine am and logging

352
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,959
off sometime between four and six pm if

353
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,880
you see one of your high level users

354
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,639
that's got access to highly critical

355
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,480
information logging on at like two

356
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,320
o'clock in the morning that should

357
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,800
trigger something for you or even better

358
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,360
using your access policies should block

359
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,880
them from being able to access

360
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,720
putting some form of password protection

361
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,680
in place because we don't want to see

362
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,760
reuse passwords we don't want to see

363
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,240
insecure passwords we don't want to see

364
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,079
passwords being used that we know have

365
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:43,120
been used in breaches so using some form

366
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,600
of password protection over your users

367
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,519
preventing them from doing some of those

368
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,160
very simple but dumb things

369
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,240
lessens the load on you and it lessens

370
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,720
the chance that their account is going

371
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,760
to become compromised

372
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,519
the other side of that as well is look

373
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,639
at going passwordless using tokens using

374
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,079
biometrics

375
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,480
i have no idea what my password is i log

376
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,000
on with my face

377
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,360
so

378
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,600
it's another way of stepping that up

379
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,959
users then won't have to remember

380
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,560
anything

381
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,959
users are constantly forgetting things

382
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:19,760
and users are likely going to be

383
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,079
your first point of entry when it comes

384
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,320
to any breach so doing things that make

385
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,279
it easier for them and more secure is

386
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:29,680
what you are aiming for

387
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,360
and then finally we need to have some

388
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,720
form of governance and analytics and

389
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,920
again you're going to hear me talking a

390
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,519
lot about governance today so making

391
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,279
sure you're performing access audits

392
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,839
checking who's logging on who has access

393
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:41,839
who has the rights making sure you're

394
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,240
disabling users removing deprecated

395
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,120
users performing all of those identity

396
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,240
life cycle items that you need to do to

397
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,680
ensure that the users that are

398
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,120
authenticating

399
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,480
are who you want to be authenticating

400
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,720
endpoints

401
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,519
so

402
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,480
we need to make sure that we are

403
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,560
securing all of our endpoints and yes

404
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,560
that does include the ones that aren't

405
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,120
even ours i swear that byod is going to

406
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,440
be the death of us all

407
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,560
but we need to make sure that the

408
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,079
devices that are accessing our

409
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,600
infrastructure so the ones that are

410
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,040
logging on with our credentials that are

411
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,040
using our applications they're accessing

412
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,839
our organizational data are storing our

413
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,160
organizational data are registered and

414
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,320
enrolled in some way so that we can keep

415
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,600
track of them

416
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
and then from there we want to be

417
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,360
setting up configuration profiles we

418
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,120
want to make sure that if you are

419
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,839
connecting into our environment you

420
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,240
have a vpn you have got endpoint

421
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,199
protection you have recently updated i

422
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,959
know what location you're coming from

423
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,360
and it's not latvia at 3am in the

424
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,600
morning so making sure that you are

425
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,680
tracking your endpoints so that you can

426
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,320
keep tabs on which ones are coming in

427
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,920
as well as making sure that when they're

428
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,160
coming in they are compliant to whatever

429
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,079
policies you've set

430
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,759
now this is crucial because without it

431
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,079
we've got some really big risks because

432
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:03,519
we need to make sure that whatever

433
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,000
devices are accessing our network

434
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,560
are meeting some form of minimum

435
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,480
requirements they are the requirements

436
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,000
that we have set as part of our

437
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,639
governance and strategy to say

438
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,480
these are the type of devices we want

439
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,759
accessing our information

440
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,920
applications

441
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,839
i've said it in my security basics talk

442
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:28,160
but you don't know what you don't know

443
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,600
and applications are probably one of the

444
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,680
biggest parts out there when it comes to

445
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,920
not knowing things so the first thing we

446
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,199
need to do is make sure that we've got

447
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,120
some form of cloud

448
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,240
access security broker to inventory all

449
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,480
of the applications that our users are

450
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,480
using okay

451
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,399
and as part of that we're going to then

452
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:48,399
find all of that lurking shadow i.t

453
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,000
that's out there because i guarantee you

454
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,920
that it's out there you will have users

455
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,720
using applications that you have no idea

456
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,680
about and you want to find those

457
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,199
so from that point once we've

458
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,880
inventoried we've worked out what our

459
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,480
users are signing into and what they're

460
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,480
accessing we want to know what those

461
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,559
applications are doing

462
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,039
so what data are they accessing

463
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,280
what information regarding your users

464
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,880
can they see

465
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,799
how are they using that data

466
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,280
so when we're looking at inventorying

467
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,959
all of our applications we are obviously

468
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,880
going to be monitoring them so with that

469
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,599
monitoring in real time

470
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,000
we want to make sure that we've got

471
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,760
adaptive access control so we can

472
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,880
monitor

473
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,039
as the users are authenticated what

474
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,640
they're doing in those applications and

475
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,600
whether any of our controls have changed

476
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,400
so they may be accessing an application

477
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,720
from within your environment on a laptop

478
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,960
but they may then pick up that laptop

479
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,200
and then take it and then go and sit in

480
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,039
a coffee shop on an unsecured wireless

481
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,280
network and still be accessing that data

482
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,679
we need to adaptively look for that and

483
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,360
make sure that we are blocking those

484
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,840
kind of access requests when they

485
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,720
happen now when we're looking at

486
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,160
protecting the data that those

487
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,080
applications are accessing we need to

488
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,799
make sure that the data that is ours

489
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,720
that is our organization's data is

490
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,559
staying within our organization because

491
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,559
we are looking very much when it comes

492
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,640
to this kind of stuff for insider

493
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,280
threats data exfiltration is one of the

494
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,799
main ways to breach an organization

495
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,240
and then finally one of the things that

496
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,919
i really like talking about is making it

497
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,160
easier for users because that at the end

498
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,600
of the day we are here to serve our

499
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,880
users so

500
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,280
make it easy for your users to access

501
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,960
applications give them some form of

502
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,440
catalog that they can download and

503
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,080
install applications from if you don't

504
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,320
make it easy for them they will find a

505
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,080
way to circumvent the controls that you

506
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,080
put in place and that is how you get

507
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,799
shadow i.t

508
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:51,679
data

509
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,000
so similar to our applications we need

510
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,440
to know what we have

511
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,280
because how can we protect it if we

512
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,120
don't know about it

513
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,080
now as part of finding that data which i

514
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,000
know that that's kind of glossing over

515
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,240
it finding data in itself is probably

516
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,640
one of the hardest parts of our job

517
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:11,039
but when we find that data classifying

518
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:12,799
it because we need to make sure we know

519
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,320
what that data is what level of

520
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,880
classification it's at because we need

521
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,559
to be able to protect it if we haven't

522
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,799
classified it we don't know what level

523
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,320
of protection we need to have for that

524
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,400
particular piece of data now these will

525
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,240
likely be different depending on your

526
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,880
organization depending on what level of

527
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,480
protection you have within your

528
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,679
organization bu government or defense or

529
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:36,400
banking financial etc

530
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
but we need to put some automation

531
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,640
around that and i think automation

532
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,240
around data classification is something

533
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,320
that we don't do very well so working

534
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,919
out how you can find that data and then

535
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,240
automatically classify it based on the

536
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,080
type of data it is is going to be really

537
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,440
important

538
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,720
and then of course

539
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,240
encrypt it

540
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,679
we need to make sure that our sensitive

541
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:01,600
data or if possible all of our data

542
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:05,200
is encrypted both in transit and at rest

543
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,280
again this is another basic that i don't

544
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,720
see done that well or that often

545
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,799
and just like we did with applications

546
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,480
real-time monitoring of how that data is

547
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,280
being accessed and used who's accessing

548
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,679
accessing it what is accessing it what

549
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,159
applications are using it um because as

550
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:24,480
i said insider threats are still a thing

551
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,600
data exfiltration is still happening um

552
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,400
the data is where the value is at it's

553
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,559
not your infrastructure it's not your

554
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,760
network it's the data people are after

555
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,200
and that's what you need to protect

556
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,720
with our infrastructure

557
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,720
just in time access

558
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,640
again i don't see it done all that often

559
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,480
no one should have permanent rights to

560
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,159
be able to jump onto a server or

561
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,559
a container it should be

562
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:57,039
as needed that's the whole idea of just

563
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:59,360
in time now i know it is easier said

564
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,000
than done but starting with our crown

565
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,320
jewels and working our way down through

566
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,559
our technology stack

567
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,480
will be a good start of being able to

568
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,320
implement this find what is your most

569
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,400
important stuff and look at putting just

570
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,480
in time on them and then work your way

571
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,720
down yes it's going to take a long time

572
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,440
but it is totally going to be worth it

573
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,039
another thing that's really important

574
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,280
here is application control on your

575
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,640
infrastructure because at the end of the

576
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,760
day

577
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,360
your servers are just

578
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:29,120
endpoints and applications that's all

579
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,840
they really are so we need to make sure

580
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,559
we know what applications are running on

581
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,720
our infrastructure um and that any

582
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,799
unauthorized or unvetted applications

583
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,039
are blocked and alerted for we want to

584
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,440
know when stuff is running on these

585
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,520
highly important pieces of

586
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,799
infrastructure

587
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,120
that shouldn't be running

588
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,039
and then monitoring is the final step so

589
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,039
assume breach means we need to be

590
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,280
keeping a really close eye on all of our

591
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,120
infrastructure be it on-prem or in the

592
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,400
cloud

593
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,159
and as part of this monitoring we need

594
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,720
to be doing both proactive and reactive

595
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,240
so proactive is looking for those

596
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,640
security improvements finding ways you

597
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,880
can improve on the security of your

598
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,200
infrastructure versus the reactive of

599
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,120
constantly fighting fires and finding

600
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,960
those alerts that are triggering from

601
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,360
things that are going bad now i realize

602
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,880
that for a lot of you

603
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,200
reactive is just the standard mode of

604
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
operation you are constantly fighting

605
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,080
fires it is constantly a battle of

606
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,240
chasing your tail and chasing incidents

607
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,039
we need to slowly move from that so

608
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,960
moving towards the more proactive

609
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,559
putting in those proactive things in

610
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,280
place is going to reduce your reactive

611
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,280
load

612
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,039
and then network

613
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,240
so what we're talking about here is

614
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,320
micro segmentation i told you we'd get

615
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,320
to network segmentation eventually

616
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,240
um we're trying to limit lateral

617
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,000
movement within your organization that's

618
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,400
the whole idea here so looking at that

619
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
assumed breach

620
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,880
putting in place context

621
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,200
driven access controls and just in time

622
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,000
access across your network

623
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,480
looking at traffic filtering so making

624
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,159
sure that your networks are configured

625
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,000
to only allow the traffic they

626
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,159
absolutely need so it's very much that

627
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,320
least privileged model of

628
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,760
ensuring that the traffic that is

629
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,679
traversing your network

630
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,400
is only what you require that you don't

631
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,039
have open firewalls you don't have

632
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:25,760
fully slather open ports you don't have

633
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,240
like a darknet diaries one that i just

634
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,200
listened to recently a domain controller

635
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,600
open to the internet for all and sundry

636
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,159
to access so you need to be making sure

637
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,760
that you are controlling what is

638
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,600
traversing your network

639
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,200
and just like with your infrastructure

640
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,720
we need to be monitoring so we need to

641
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,279
be proactively and reactively responding

642
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,279
to threats of potential vulnerabilities

643
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,440
as quickly as we possibly can

644
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,840
and that includes utilizing some form of

645
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,559
threat protection so looking at the iocs

646
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,720
that are coming into your environment

647
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,679
utilizing those to automatically block

648
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:04,039
those threats against your environment

649
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,799
now i know i said six pillars but we do

650
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,360
have a seventh so this is the foundation

651
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,760
pillar so this is your visibility

652
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,520
automation and governance so it

653
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,760
underpins all of the other pillars and i

654
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,760
see it as you can see in this image it's

655
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,840
very precarious because we don't do a

656
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,760
very good job of it

657
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,679
so visibility is where monitoring comes

658
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,200
into play now i've spoken a lot about

659
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,960
monitoring under each of the other

660
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,000
pillars

661
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,240
but the issue that i see with visibility

662
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,640
is that visibility in itself isn't

663
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,960
enough having that data isn't enough you

664
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,720
need to be doing something with it i'll

665
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,240
say it again

666
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,880
collection isn't detection it's great if

667
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,640
you're getting those logs but unless

668
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,640
you're putting them somewhere and doing

669
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,880
something with them it is a waste of

670
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:47,919
time

671
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:48,720
so

672
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,480
making sure that it is feeding into

673
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,039
something that we are giving it context

674
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,279
be it a person who's looking at it or be

675
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,720
it a

676
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,039
automation tool if possible that we can

677
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,799
use to find the signal within the noise

678
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,559
we need to be correlating the data so

679
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,120
that we can see the forest for the trees

680
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,120
we need distinct

681
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,520
monitoring pieces absolutely for all the

682
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,200
different parts of our environment and

683
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,880
our infrastructure and across our

684
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,200
digital estate but it's of no use if

685
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,200
those distinct individual monitoring

686
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,760
pieces aren't talking to one another and

687
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,360
aren't feeding into something that we

688
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:26,000
can then use to look across the entire

689
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,720
digital estate and then of course we've

690
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,960
got governance so so much of what we do

691
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,279
now is defined by policy so we need to

692
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,760
have policies in place so this is the

693
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,360
fundamental policies and government

694
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,880
structures that we put in place to

695
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,240
define

696
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,640
what is and isn't acceptable for our

697
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,559
organization because there is no

698
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:46,640
one-size-fits-all

699
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,120
what is and isn't compliant remembering

700
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,760
that compliance doesn't equal security

701
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,679
you can be compliant with a standard and

702
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,080
be completely insecure so we need to

703
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,000
make sure that the governance structures

704
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,279
that we put in place work for us in both

705
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,120
making us compliant and secure

706
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,120
maintaining these policies and these

707
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,640
governance structures is really

708
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,880
important they are not set and forget we

709
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,919
can't just

710
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,720
build them and then walk away okay

711
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,520
all of them go into forming our zero

712
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,000
trust strategy methodology and

713
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,640
architecture

714
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,880
right so we've got all of our pillars

715
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,880
we've got our identities our endpoints

716
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,480
applications

717
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,480
our data our infrastructure and our

718
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,480
network and of course our foundation of

719
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,679
visibility governance and automation

720
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,559
that's quite a lot of stuff

721
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,240
so how does it all fit together to form

722
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,120
that zero trust now i'm very very sorry

723
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,640
i usually don't do this in my slide

724
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:50,000
decks but i do have a non-meme slide

725
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,600
i promise you that it's for a good

726
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,400
reason

727
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,799
um and it's the only slide in my deck

728
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,240
that isn't a meme but you know i

729
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,720
wouldn't do it if it wasn't important

730
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,080
so

731
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,640
yes i have blatantly pinched this from

732
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,799
some documentation um and it is

733
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,320
microsoft documentation but i have

734
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,960
chosen this one specifically because it

735
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,679
is completely vendor agnostic

736
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,320
there is nothing in here that lists any

737
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,880
specific type of application any type of

738
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,120
vendor product any type of operating

739
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,279
system it is completely vendor neutral

740
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,360
which is why i absolutely love it this

741
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,640
can apply to any environment so coming

742
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,799
from our identities with our strong

743
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:30,640
authentication and our monitoring of

744
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,159
identity risk

745
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,120
our endpoints be they ours be they byod

746
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,799
be they

747
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,799
in an office be they in a remote

748
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,799
location be they in the cloud

749
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,880
and then going through and classifying

750
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:44,080
our data

751
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,080
ensuring we've got visibility and

752
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,640
adaptive access to our applications

753
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,120
control over our infrastructure and then

754
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,799
filtering and segmentation on our

755
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,080
network

756
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,720
underpinned by our threat protection

757
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,440
automation and then our overarching

758
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,080
organizational governance and policy

759
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,120
okay

760
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,559
it's a pretty picture there's a reason

761
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,200
that i have it up um

762
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,600
this is what we're aiming for okay so

763
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,399
this is this is a zero trust

764
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,279
frame this is a zero trust architecture

765
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,480
and methodology

766
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,399
when you are looking at putting zero

767
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,240
trust in your environment you need to

768
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,919
look at all of it and i can hear you

769
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,600
going yes that's lovely that's beautiful

770
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,960
where the do i start

771
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,640
so

772
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,120
i like making lists so these are my big

773
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,120
ticket items of what you need to look at

774
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,440
doing in order to be able to start

775
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,600
putting zero trust in place now don't

776
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,120
get me wrong i don't want you to skip

777
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,240
over any of what i've talked about but

778
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,679
these are the couple of things that i

779
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,120
think we need to do and these are the

780
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,600
ones that i see organizations getting

781
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,760
wrong and what we really need to focus

782
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,559
on okay so number one reducing our

783
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,200
legacy on-prem infrastructure okay now i

784
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,760
am not uh the cloud is here to save us

785
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,159
all kind of person i am very well aware

786
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,880
that hybrid is here to stay um that

787
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,720
everyone is going to have some form of

788
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,039
on-prem infrastructure for a while to

789
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,440
come yet um at the same time though

790
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,520
pretty much all of the legacy stuff that

791
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,000
we have so i'm looking at those of you

792
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,600
out there who still are running server

793
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,840
2003 and server 2008 and i will hunt

794
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,799
down every one of them eventually um

795
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,960
that all sits on prem

796
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,799
i don't see a lot of it up in the cloud

797
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,240
if you migrate and lift and shift that

798
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,799
up into the cloud i will slap you but

799
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:33,200
it's on-prem so trying to reduce all of

800
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,600
that down as much as physically possible

801
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,159
i know it's a hard ask um but it's

802
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:40,000
trying to get rid of that trying to move

803
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,840
that to somewhere

804
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,679
that you can control it better and look

805
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,520
after the security of it better upgrade

806
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,360
it to a new operating system shift it to

807
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,279
be a sas application whatever it is you

808
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,360
need to do

809
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,960
managing your identities and end points

810
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,399
in the cloud

811
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,559
mainly because the two are intrinsically

812
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:58,080
linked and this thing gives you better

813
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,720
functionality to utilize up in the cloud

814
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,159
so things like jit and pam and identity

815
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,880
governance controls password protection

816
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,799
risk-based access controls things that

817
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,840
we don't really have access to on-prem

818
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,760
and if we can put them up in the cloud

819
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,120
it means that we have more control

820
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,559
because then we're utilizing single

821
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,640
sign-on i hope and we're controlling our

822
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,320
identities no matter where they are be

823
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,840
it on-prem or in the cloud

824
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
tied to the previous point

825
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,320
making sure that devices no matter who's

826
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,440
they are

827
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,480
are compliant this is a really big one

828
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,399
making sure you have really good

829
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,880
compliancy policies to

830
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:39,760
um make sure that you've got what is

831
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,960
required

832
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,000
to access your network

833
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,360
mfa i'm not going to yell about it

834
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,840
anymore i've done enough of mfa but yes

835
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,440
making sure that we've got mfa sorted

836
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,760
putting access policies and controls in

837
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,679
place and enforcing them

838
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,600
it's not enough to have them in place

839
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,960
and auditing we need to enforce

840
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,120
securing your applications via identity

841
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,200
and endpoint integration so we want to

842
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,279
make it easier for our users to be able

843
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,679
to access our applications we don't want

844
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:11,120
to make it harder

845
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,279
and then lastly monitoring please if

846
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,360
it's the only thing you take away is put

847
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,360
in place better monitoring

848
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,799
feed all of the signals you're getting

849
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,720
somewhere central put them somewhere

850
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,559
where you can look at all of them make

851
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,080
sure you're correlating across your

852
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,039
entire environment

853
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,519
now that's not to say that all of that

854
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,880
is easy it's not it's hard um and with

855
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,559
the customers that i've helped i know

856
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,760
that it's hard um but i want to help it

857
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:40,960
make

858
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,320
it a little bit easier for you so my top

859
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,799
tips when it comes to this are you need

860
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,440
to balance usability with security okay

861
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,200
there is no point in us putting security

862
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,559
in place when it's going to make the

863
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,480
jobs of the people that we are working

864
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,000
for harder we are there to enable them

865
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,559
so we have to do what we can

866
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,039
to improve user experience that really

867
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,440
needs to be a focus of what we do and i

868
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,279
don't think it has been a focus of what

869
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,919
we've done previously we've very much

870
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:12,880
been the gatekeepers the police we need

871
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,279
to switch that around and help our users

872
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,200
instead of hinder them

873
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,880
you can't just focus on one piece of the

874
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,320
puzzle so you've heard me talk about

875
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,000
monitoring across your entire digital

876
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,880
estate it's because all of it matters

877
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,960
yes something is better than nothing but

878
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,559
we have to look at everything

879
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,480
identity and security are intrinsically

880
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,840
tied together

881
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,360
and i've spoken about that from a

882
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:37,440
technology standpoint but i don't think

883
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,519
we do a good enough job of integrating

884
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,000
our teams quite often when i go into

885
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,799
organizations it is security versus

886
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:48,320
operations i see so many teams fighting

887
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,960
with each other for dominance siloing

888
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,039
each other off and competing against one

889
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:56,159
another we are not competitors we should

890
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,559
be working together

891
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,320
both security and operations

892
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,240
particularly your identity operations

893
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,159
staff to be able to put a lot of this in

894
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,399
place

895
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,799
automate as much as possible

896
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,559
let your people do the stuff that is

897
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:11,919
actually important rather than the

898
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:13,679
boring and mundane

899
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,600
and then finally it isn't all about the

900
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,799
tech

901
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:19,039
you'll notice that i didn't mention

902
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,919
products vendors technologies i'm

903
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,320
literally interested in how we go about

904
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,440
doing this no matter what you are using

905
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:29,840
there are numerous options out there use

906
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,760
what works for you

907
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,159
use what works for your organization for

908
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,559
your business for your budget

909
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,480
there's no point in us dictating what

910
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,600
product you should be using um

911
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,320
the policies and controls and governance

912
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,240
are more important than the technology

913
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,720
you use

914
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,480
so

915
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,440
zero trust not really we trust but we

916
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,640
verify

917
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,960
um everyone and everything needs to

918
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,200
prove they are who they say they are in

919
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,880
order to get access to anything in our

920
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,200
environments so in the end zero trust

921
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,799
isn't about the tech it's about the

922
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:06,880
policies and the people who are putting

923
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:08,879
it in place

924
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,480
we need to make sure that we are doing

925
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,800
what we can as secops people

926
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,719
to allow our users

927
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,760
people

928
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,719
to access their data their applications

929
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,040
as securely as possible

930
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,739
thank you very much

931
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:27,909
[Applause]

932
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,918
thanks jess thanks jess that was great

933
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,599
um

934
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,199
have actually got two questions here

935
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,280
okay uh when you model just answered us

936
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,440
from colby uh do you have any advice for

937
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,000
a company that wants to go passwordless

938
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,918
um it depends on how you want to go

939
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,320
about doing it so going passwordless

940
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,359
isn't something you can do just

941
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:49,199
overnight

942
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,639
users do get a little bit concerned

943
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,159
making sure i think that you have the

944
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,839
right devices in place

945
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,520
i think the biggest

946
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,719
drawback i've seen for a lot of

947
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,640
organizations is they want to go

948
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,240
passwordless they start rolling it out

949
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,440
and realize that they haven't found

950
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,760
those edge cases those users that don't

951
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,280
want to have

952
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,119
an mfa token on their personal mobile

953
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,040
phone or a device that isn't compatible

954
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,119
with the biometrics you want so making

955
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,280
sure you've got all of that in place

956
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,359
first before you start looking at

957
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,760
rolling it out to catch those edge cases

958
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,119
otherwise you're never going to be able

959
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,200
to get a fully passwordless

960
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,078
environment in place

961
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,880
great great we have another question too

962
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,280
um the question is is there any advice

963
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,119
for on managing service partners that

964
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,599
require access to legacy apps that can't

965
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,720
be upgraded easily

966
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,480
try and silo them off as much as

967
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,000
possible so that's where that micro

968
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,079
segmentation comes into play so you want

969
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,720
a very tiny network space that's set

970
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,359
aside for those legacy applications or

971
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,200
legacy servers that you've got and you

972
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,560
want to make sure that it is strictly

973
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,480
controlled and strictly monitored so

974
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,560
those particular things i see it a lot i

975
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,400
see it a lot in government i see it a

976
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,320
lot in higher ed as well because there

977
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,320
is legacy stuff that we can't get rid of

978
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,480
i know it's going to be there but trying

979
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,839
to

980
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,000
section it off and segment it off as

981
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,920
much as you physically can and try and

982
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,160
remove the reliability on it so i think

983
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,079
that's the issue a lot of people become

984
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:14,480
reliable on those pieces of technology

985
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,680
that they don't look at other options so

986
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,480
removing that reliance and and trying to

987
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,240
shift people on to something else is

988
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,800
going to be a better option

989
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,240
great we've got time for one more

990
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,640
question it's um from joshua

991
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,400
do you have any advice for user

992
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,640
acceptance for posture checking

993
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,040
byd situations

994
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,440
user acceptance

995
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,040
it really does come down to what you

996
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,640
want to accept as a risk in your

997
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,520
organization so when we're talking

998
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,320
byod coming into your environment you

999
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,720
have to work out what your risk profile

1000
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,119
is you have to work out

1001
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,440
where you see your biggest risks being

1002
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:00,320
but also balancing that against

1003
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,839
what your users are likely to be

1004
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,680
bringing into your environment so you

1005
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,520
don't want to make the bar

1006
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,440
too high but at the same time you want

1007
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,599
to make sure that your data your

1008
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,079
organization is secure so making sure

1009
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:13,359
that you're setting it like at a bare

1010
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,119
minimum somewhere and i think that's the

1011
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,880
tough part is working out what your bare

1012
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,440
minimum is going to be and then working

1013
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,280
from that a lot of it is going to come

1014
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,800
down to

1015
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,680
um

1016
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,000
your users themselves

1017
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,400
uh bringing in devices and coming up

1018
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,160
against those blocks that you've put in

1019
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,680
place and those compliance policies that

1020
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,200
you've put in place and then you

1021
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,960
adjusting that as i said it's never

1022
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,720
going to be set and forget you're always

1023
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,000
going to be constantly tweaking it

1024
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,560
