1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
uh hello everyone

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,600
do you like to take a seat

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,680
we've got a

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,519
speaker that needs no introduction he's

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:12,160
a local on the gold coast

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,240
and he has all of your passwords here's

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,480
troy hunt

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,080
wow people this is cool

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,199
i couldn't even figure out how to make

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,880
my sound work i'm not entirely sure if

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,080
it's going to work i just realized i

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,199
think it's been so long since i've

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,439
played sound in front of real people so

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,000
we're we're all winging it a little bit

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,600
but look jumping uh right into it

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,640
because i have got a heap of stuff i

17
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,160
want to cover today i'm going to talk a

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,800
lot about things i've been doing with

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,480
have i been pwned

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,079
now just for context has anyone used

21
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,160
this before

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,600
all right so for the for the three

23
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,920
people that hadn't have i've been phoned

24
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,000
as a data breach aggregation service so

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,520
when there's a breach

26
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,440
of a major online service and the data

27
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,960
gets spread all around the web i

28
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,480
aggregate it here

29
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,359
i make it searchable so 594

30
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,879
different data breaches in there as of

31
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,159
today

32
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,280
you're probably in one of them from

33
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,640
folks who've used has anyone been in

34
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,320
linkedin data breach

35
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,320
yeah dropbox data breach

36
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,760
actually madison data bridge

37
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,960
my twelve-year-old son's here i'll

38
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,400
explain that to you later it's a fun

39
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,920
that's not really a fun story it's a

40
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,439
terrible story

41
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,520
oh crap all right just explaining to do

42
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,479
now

43
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,080
anyway so when all of these incidents

44
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,560
happen and they become searchable the

45
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,320
email address is going to here you can

46
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,240
search for it and it says look this is

47
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,640
where you've been exposed and it aims to

48
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,920
answer that question have i been pwned

49
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,240
now i kicked this off

50
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,240
more than eight years ago now it's uh

51
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,240
it's actually started to get quite old

52
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,320
back in 2013

53
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,240
and my expectation at the time was look

54
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,479
it'll be a bit of fun like some of my

55
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,479
mates will use it

56
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,560
not everyone was convinced they thought

57
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,320
i was gonna run some sort of like email

58
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,399
address harvesting scheme

59
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,759
and i always thought that was kind of

60
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,280
interesting because

61
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,320
i started with like 155 million email

62
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,360
addresses

63
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,600
largely from the adobe data breach that

64
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,878
was about 150 something and then a few

65
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:09,840
others

66
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,280
and in fact the reason i did it and the

67
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,800
reason that adobe in particular

68
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,520
fascinated me is because i was in that

69
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,959
breach twice

70
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,200
so once with my work address and once

71
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,959
with my personal address

72
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,120
so i thought that was interesting

73
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,480
and i also thought it was interesting

74
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,760
because

75
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,360
i knew what photoshop was but i didn't

76
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,760
know why adobe had my data

77
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,920
but i was a macromedia dreamweaver user

78
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,280
back in the day and obviously i'd given

79
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,280
macromedia my data and then suddenly my

80
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,760
data ends up on the web and up here

81
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,360
now one of the things we're we're seeing

82
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,599
a lot in data breaches and i guess the

83
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,120
real crux of what i want to talk about

84
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,680
today is passwords

85
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,120
and i think it's sort of worthwhile like

86
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,599
recapping on how we got to where we are

87
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,920
with passwords and why we need to do

88
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,480
things differently

89
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,159
so think back

90
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,599
think back i was going to say think back

91
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,680
60 years i know dad's old but i can't

92
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,000
think back 60 years mate but 60 years

93
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,400
ago this was the first time that we had

94
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,800
passwords on computer systems

95
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,120
and this was mit back in the 60s so it's

96
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,480
believed to be the first ever use case

97
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,440
of a password on a computer system

98
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,040
and it's kind of fascinating to think

99
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,280
about what it would have been like then

100
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,280
in terms of risks and in terms of the

101
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,319
way people approached passwords

102
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,400
so risk-wise

103
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,400
you needed physical access so the only

104
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,840
way anyone's going to be able to log on

105
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,519
to a system using your password is that

106
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,120
they've got to get into

107
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,000
the room of computer

108
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,599
sophisticated knowledge like if you get

109
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:38,879
in there

110
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,319
what do you do

111
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,000
i don't know what i would do

112
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,840
if i got i don't know like is it tapes

113
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,519
or punch cards or

114
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,040
or what is it

115
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,799
so you can see how the risk factors were

116
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,560
really really different when we first

117
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,439
started getting passwords

118
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,040
no social media you could use your dog's

119
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,000
name as a password and get away with it

120
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,599
and because it's the only system in the

121
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,879
world at that time that actually has a

122
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,799
password there's no password reuse so

123
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,360
you're fine

124
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,680
so the 60s was a very very simple time

125
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,439
for having passwords but then as we

126
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,519
start to progress through the decades

127
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,519
and we get into sort of the 80s era we

128
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,079
start getting computer systems for the

129
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,238
masses so computer systems

130
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,959
in the home

131
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,360
this is a prestel and prestel is one of

132
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,280
the very first generation

133
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,800
of computer systems that not only could

134
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,160
put in your home but you could then

135
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,960
remote into other systems

136
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,120
and suddenly we've gone from having

137
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,560
one monolithic system in a university to

138
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,720
tens of thousands of prestails around

139
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,960
the world that can now remotely dial

140
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,759
into a service

141
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,120
there's a little video clip here i'm

142
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,479
going to see if this sound works or not

143
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,320
but in this clip there's an interview

144
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,800
with the guy who shows how to log into

145
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,680
the prestel now as this plays even if

146
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,680
you can't hear him

147
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,280
see if you can figure out what his

148
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,000
password is

149
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,400
you definitely can't hear him

150
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,240
okay

151
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,919
anyone get that

152
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,680
let's uh zoom and enhance we'll do it

153
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,840
again

154
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:15,759
all right you got this

155
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,080
okay so we know that for at least 40

156
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,000
years we have been choosing terrible

157
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,600
passwords

158
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,039
but the risk is different right like the

159
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:26,479
risk is very different here to mit

160
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,400
because now you've got

161
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,000
tens of thousands of instances you don't

162
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,360
need this sophisticated knowledge you

163
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,199
don't need physical presence and

164
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,960
suddenly we can't really get away with

165
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,560
passwords like one two three four which

166
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,600
you might have been able to do two

167
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,240
decades earlier

168
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,600
and then it got worse and worse because

169
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,639
we went forward another couple of

170
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,800
decades and we got through

171
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,560
so we know this is going we got through

172
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,080
into the naughties

173
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,880
and we're talking about a time now

174
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,440
where we've got millions of online

175
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,720
services

176
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,000
and then we've got

177
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
tens of millions

178
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,479
of people tens i don't know tens of

179
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:01,600
billions we're not quite up to that but

180
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,520
we're up to multiple billions of people

181
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,840
using online services so the risk

182
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,720
factors all extrapolate again

183
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,520
more access more people more systems

184
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,759
more bad passwords

185
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,600
anyway we fixed it and the way we fixed

186
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,120
it is we came up with password

187
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,600
complexity criteria

188
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,759
now this is file footage and bob and bob

189
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,479
is

190
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,319
on a website he's trying to register and

191
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,759
the website says bob in order to

192
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:27,600
register your password must have at

193
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,360
least one uppercase character at least

194
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,039
one lowercase character you've got to

195
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:32,560
have a number you've got to have a

196
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,400
non-alphanumeric character

197
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,919
it can't be any of the last five

198
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,759
passwords that you've used before it

199
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,840
cannot have the name of the service in

200
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,520
it and bob's losing his freaking mind

201
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,360
because you can't create a password

202
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,120
anymore it's frustrating

203
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,199
so we come up with fixes and this is

204
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,400
always fun i'm really glad i can do in

205
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,599
front of an audience again because i

206
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,720
know what's going to happen here this is

207
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,800
great so you go to our website you have

208
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,319
that same terrible six character

209
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,160
lowercase password

210
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,560
that you use everywhere and the website

211
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,840
says you've got to have at least one

212
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,119
uppercase character what do you do

213
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,039
right first letter and what's really

214
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,639
funny is because i can see everyone out

215
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,560
here and everyone's like oh i don't

216
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,160
want to acknowledge it

217
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,440
and everyone looks really nervous and

218
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,800
then someone says it and everyone's like

219
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,240
oh crap they've figured it out i'm going

220
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,560
to have to change their passwords

221
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,120
and we can continue the game too so what

222
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,240
happens when you need to have a number

223
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,080
one at the end okay non-elephant numeric

224
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,800
character

225
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,240
exclamation mark at the end all lead

226
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,280
speak you start doing character

227
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:34,560
substitution

228
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,199
uh now this is great

229
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,880
until you work out that everybody knows

230
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,639
how it works and then you sort of go

231
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,840
well

232
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,840
if everybody knows how it works like

233
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,479
does it work

234
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,400
because we end up with passwords like

235
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,840
this and this meets the criteria

236
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,840
and you sort of look at that and go well

237
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,360
that's that's not a good password

238
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,479
because it is just character

239
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,199
substitution lead speak it is

240
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,080
a dictionary word that's just

241
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,879
following a pattern

242
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,960
so what happens is we we condition

243
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,720
people to thinking that they're creating

244
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,000
good passwords when they're creating

245
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,759
terrible passwords and then we see the

246
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,680
inevitable results

247
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,039
i'll give you a really good example of

248
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,560
this there's a really fun search i like

249
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,560
doing on twitter so what you do is you

250
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,280
search for netflix hacked

251
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,199
and you get all of these tweets along

252
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,000
the lines of this one here

253
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,199
now for those of you at the back and a

254
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,360
small text somebody hacked into my

255
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,599
netflix added their entire family locked

256
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,240
the accounts and it's in spanish

257
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,080
lol

258
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,080
and it's full of this honestly go and do

259
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,399
the search after this it's hilarious

260
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,159
and i guess the reason i find this

261
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,839
fascinating is when you search for

262
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,920
netflix hacked so many of the results

263
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,760
are for people saying that their account

264
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,279
was hacked as though somehow this is

265
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,360
like netflix's fault someone hacked

266
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,959
netflix

267
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,640
i know exactly what

268
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,120
oli tay has done

269
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:01,040
so inevitably people try and find ways

270
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,519
around the fact that their accounts keep

271
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,920
getting taken over and they get very

272
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,880
creative about the way they do this

273
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,480
but this is really not where we want to

274
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,680
be like we don't want to end up in a

275
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,440
situation where we have these masses of

276
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,040
account takeover attacks and password

277
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,120
spraying and credential stuffing and all

278
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,880
the things that we've all seen so many

279
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,279
times

280
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,640
so what's happening here is we're

281
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,160
getting sort of an industry shift in the

282
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,680
guidance this has been happening for a

283
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,000
good solid five years now

284
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,279
we've got the likes of nist saying

285
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,839
we really want to move away from things

286
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,480
like arbitrary complexity criteria for

287
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,320
the very reason that that demonstration

288
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,920
just showed because it's

289
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,839
very predictable people know exactly

290
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,279
what's going to happen when we do that

291
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,040
in fact nist specifically said what we

292
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,519
should be doing is blocking passwords

293
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:52,480
obtained from previous breach corpuses

294
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,320
so in other words when there's a data

295
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,600
breach and there's a whole bunch of

296
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,720
passwords in there and they get spread

297
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,720
all around the internet

298
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,720
let's not let people continue to use

299
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,040
those passwords because now they're

300
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,959
known compromised and that's when we get

301
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:08,079
credentials stuffing attacks

302
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,160
so i saw the nest guidance and i thought

303
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,000
this this was really good

304
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,320
uh where are the passwords

305
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,839
and they don't give them to you they

306
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,000
basically just say stop using bad

307
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,640
passwords that have been in breaches uh

308
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,720
good luck

309
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,880
so i gave it some thought and i realized

310
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,200
i had a lot of passwords because of all

311
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,000
of the data breaches and have a bampon

312
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,040
so a few years ago i stood up phoned

313
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,480
passwords so it's in there under the

314
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,320
little passwords menu

315
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,000
on have i been pwned

316
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
i admittedly went a little bit cheap

317
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,440
with the design and copy pasted the

318
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,040
email search and we ended up with a

319
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,880
password search

320
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,959
and i stood it up with a couple of

321
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:48,480
hundred million passwords from the

322
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,959
breaches i already had

323
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,480
a lot of these breaches have passwords

324
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,680
in plain text

325
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,079
easy job a lot of them have got very

326
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,399
weakly stored password hashes so

327
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,000
linkedin for example was salted shower

328
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,160
one people went through and cracked a

329
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,680
high 90

330
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,519
range of the passwords

331
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,440
distributed them out as password lists

332
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,920
they go into here

333
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,920
so i put this out there but i was really

334
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,680
conscious of sort of the optics of

335
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,160
running a website with a funny name

336
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,519
and then telling people just to come and

337
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,279
put their password in

338
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,120
so i'll be responsible and i used to

339
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,959
have this big bold bit of text up here

340
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:27,839
it says do not enter your real password

341
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,519
onto any website other than the one it's

342
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,399
meant to go into including this one

343
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,440
i thought that's great i'll put

344
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,440
instructions in that's fixed it

345
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,120
and then it's on like cnn and reporters

346
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,320
are going hey you go to this website and

347
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,880
put your business uh crap

348
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,760
but

349
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,680
i thought maybe the the net result is

350
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,760
not negative because

351
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,959
for most people it's going to be

352
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,640
terrible password

353
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,839
the website's going to come back and

354
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:50,959
you're going to say hey your password's

355
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,720
been in the data breach the penny's

356
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,760
going to drop they're going to change it

357
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,560
that's kind of a good thing

358
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,360
but i was really conscious about

359
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,200
not just the optics but the genuine risk

360
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,560
of other people

361
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,160
putting in a real password into this

362
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,680
service and then sending it over to me

363
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,519
now i've got this password in plain text

364
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,560
and

365
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,839
okay i don't necessarily have the

366
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,519
context of who it was i don't have their

367
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:12,880
email address or where they've used the

368
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,839
password but it's still a password

369
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,040
so

370
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,639
i built something cool behind it and a

371
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,000
lot of the credit for this goes to

372
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,279
cloudflare i'm going to talk more about

373
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,720
them shortly

374
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,079
but there's a really really cool

375
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,160
anonymity model and i'm going to show

376
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,760
you how it works now you can see this in

377
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,600
action yourself if ever you're in there

378
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,440
pop f12 dev tools have a look at the

379
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,519
network requests go through

380
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,519
there's an api which sits behind that

381
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,920
front page it's a little async callback

382
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,920
there's also an api that you can consume

383
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,240
from your own apps

384
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,240
here's how it works

385
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,360
we take

386
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,440
this password which we know to be secure

387
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,880
because it has an uppercase allow case

388
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,920
not alphanumeric and it's eight

389
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,600
characters long

390
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,720
and

391
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,200
we hash it shower one hash it

392
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,639
nice salt don't need assault you'll see

393
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,160
why in a moment it's just a direct

394
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,600
shower one hash now when we create a

395
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,079
show on hash we get a 40 byte string out

396
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,680
the other side

397
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,160
so this is the show one hash of a utf-8

398
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,880
encoded string that is the password

399
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,959
then go and grab those first five

400
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,720
characters so this is a hash prefix

401
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,279
now you've then got 35 bytes hanging off

402
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,959
the end

403
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,639
which could be anything

404
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,920
almost anything

405
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,600
it could be 16 to the power of 35

406
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,880
different possibilities because we're

407
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,720
hexadecimal characters we've got 16

408
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,639
different values 35 positions this is

409
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,079
why math is important you can do stuff

410
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,600
like this

411
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,320
now that number

412
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,560
is this

413
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,320
and i don't really know how to pronounce

414
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,680
it i'm not sure what it is i just know

415
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,320
it's got a lot of commas the point being

416
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,760
is that

417
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,680
if you only know the first five

418
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,639
characters of a hash of a password it is

419
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,480
as good as impossible to know what the

420
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,639
entire password is

421
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,920
the number's actually bigger than that

422
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,680
as well because you have hash collisions

423
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,560
you can have the same two input strings

424
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,399
that go into a hashing algorithm

425
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,720
and it produces let me rephrase that you

426
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,880
can have two different input strings in

427
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,720
the hashing algorithm you get the same

428
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,560
output

429
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,920
simply because there's for all intents

430
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,279
and purposes an infinite number of

431
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,600
possible strings you could feed into it

432
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,600
okay so when you only know those first

433
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,360
five characters you do not know what the

434
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,920
password is that means you can pass

435
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,160
those first five characters to an api

436
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,600
like this

437
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,120
so this is the exact url of the

438
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,639
haverbeam pwn pwn password api this is

439
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,240
how you would check

440
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,399
if the password password in the first

441
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,600
line up there

442
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,240
exists in the database

443
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,839
except how do i know that the password

444
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:42,880
is password i don't but what i can do is

445
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:45,760
i can take that hash prefix

446
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,079
and then i can tell you every hash

447
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,279
suffix

448
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,959
that i have in the database i can tell

449
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,760
you the remaining 35 bytes

450
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,519
and then how many times i've seen that

451
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,720
full password hash

452
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,959
now just so happens that that particular

453
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,560
hash

454
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,880
has been seen 83 129 times so ignoring

455
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,959
the whole password or hash collision

456
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,639
problem for a moment which really isn't

457
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,000
a problem in this case if anyone wants

458
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,480
to ask me later on i'll explain why

459
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,480
i can now return a result which has got

460
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,360
around about 800 different suffixes per

461
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,120
prefix

462
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,920
so when you call this api and you get

463
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,320
that response which we see on the second

464
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,279
line

465
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,759
you can go yep okay this is all the

466
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,279
hashes for this prefix there's the

467
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:34,160
suffix that's been seen 81 or 83 000

468
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,079
times now once you know it's been seen

469
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,560
83 000 times

470
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,759
i would argue you shouldn't let a

471
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,680
customer use that

472
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,759
there is a whole usability discussion

473
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,880
here and i'm going to show you what one

474
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,480
of the organizations that uses this does

475
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,560
with their ui but the usability

476
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,560
discussion is

477
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,720
if we block passwords that have been

478
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,399
seen before

479
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,399
will we still have customers

480
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,920
because depending on the nature of your

481
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,120
service you might find that your

482
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,399
customers are

483
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,160
normal people and they use passwords

484
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,639
that they've used before

485
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,639
this is why the prevalence is there and

486
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:07,839
if i go back to just where it was

487
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,120
scrolling through you'll see that a lot

488
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,519
of them have only been seen once before

489
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,040
so you get to make this decision right

490
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,880
so forgetting about password composition

491
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,399
how many uppercases and lowercases and

492
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,839
everything are there

493
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,839
if the password has been seen once

494
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:22,959
before do you block the customer from

495
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,120
using it

496
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,480
maybe not

497
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,839
if it's been seen

498
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,399
five times before

499
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,320
okay more likely

500
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,199
if it's been seen 83 129 times before i

501
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,880
think that's an easy answer but you get

502
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,639
to decide this is the point like i'll

503
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,320
give you the information and then you

504
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,120
figure out what you want to do with it

505
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,360
so

506
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,480
here's the other thing that sha1 prefix

507
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,519
that five hexadecimal characters

508
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:54,800
is only

509
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,399
16 to the power of five different

510
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,320
possible combinations which is a number

511
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,839
i know how to pronounce it's just over a

512
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,920
million so there are only just over a

513
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,000
million possible searches that you can

514
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,119
do

515
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,039
against phone passwords

516
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,520
so no matter what the password is it's

517
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,119
always going to hash down to something

518
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:12,559
that has the first five characters that

519
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,919
are hexadecimal and there's going to be

520
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,280
five different positions of them 16

521
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,959
possibilities 1 million total queries

522
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,640
so that allows us to do some really cool

523
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,640
things with the performance of the

524
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,000
system and this is what brings me to the

525
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,640
cloud flip piece

526
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,960
if you've not heard of cloudflare before

527
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,480
you have used them before because they

528
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,080
route a really really significant

529
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,960
portion of the internet's traffic

530
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,600
so they're in 270

531
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,280
different cities in a hundred different

532
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,799
countries around the world and when i

533
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,799
say they're in these cities they're

534
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,799
reverse proxies

535
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:47,280
so we have got a blue dot

536
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,559
in brisbane

537
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,320
and because it's a big dot and a small

538
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,320
map it basically covers the gold coast

539
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,400
but we've got somewhere close to us

540
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,160
so when we go to a service that's

541
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,080
fronted by cloudflare

542
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,160
we're connecting to brisbane and then

543
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,760
brisbane gets to decide what they want

544
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,760
to do with the request

545
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,679
cloudflare does a lot of waff style

546
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:06,480
stuff

547
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,000
lots of firewalls do we want to block an

548
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,840
asn do we want to look for malicious

549
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,400
strings and requests

550
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,679
but what's really relevant to phone

551
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,120
passwords is they also do a lot of

552
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,600
caching

553
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,600
now when we hit the brisbane edge node

554
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,440
if we're requesting one of those one

555
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,039
million and a little bit possible

556
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,320
different api hash prefixes and it's in

557
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,840
brisbane then brisbane can give us the

558
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,039
response it doesn't have to go all the

559
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,480
way to the west coast of the us where

560
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,880
the the origin service runs

561
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,799
now i'll show you what this means in

562
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,360
graph terms and i have to keep redoing

563
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,720
this graph because it keeps going up

564
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,919
really quickly which makes me really

565
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:43,200
happy

566
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,120
that pine password service has been hit

567
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,120
1.85 billion times in the last month

568
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,880
which is awesome because

569
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,320
it was only the other day when it was

570
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,160
like just over a billion and then it was

571
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,440
like a billion and a bit and then i

572
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,640
looked at it the other day and you can

573
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,919
see there's quite a big spike towards

574
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,520
the end actually so it's like wow this

575
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,520
is really really cool

576
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,280
but what's kind of even cooler with that

577
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,160
is

578
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,320
yes it's it's 1.85 billion requests

579
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,520
but 1.83 billion of them are cached so

580
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,799
99 of the time when someone requests one

581
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,559
of those hash prefixes from cloudflare

582
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,919
they get it from one of those little

583
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,200
dots on a cloud for edge node

584
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,600
now 95 of the world's population is

585
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,000
within 50 milliseconds of a cloudflare

586
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,520
edge node so what this means is for

587
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,799
organizations that want to start

588
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,440
building this api into

589
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,200
anywhere where they have their customers

590
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,120
password in plain text so login

591
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,520
registration password reset big three

592
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,039
if they want to build this api into

593
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,160
there they know they're going to get a

594
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,160
super super fast response

595
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:45,840
okay so that's good the whole thing's

596
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,559
full of passwords there's an api that

597
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:50,000
has an anonymity model you're going to

598
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,520
get it fast

599
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,280
let's talk about feeding more stuff into

600
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,400
there because this is where it starts to

601
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,559
get really interesting

602
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,600
now a little bit of a history lesson

603
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,440
have i been phoned

604
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,520
is not the only service of its type and

605
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,039
it hasn't been the only service of its

606
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,880
type

607
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,360
there have been many others

608
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,640
there was this one for example this is

609
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,919
we leak info

610
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,480
now we leak info popped up around about

611
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,159
2015

612
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:19,679
not entirely sure where they got their

613
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,880
inspiration from but anyway

614
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,799
the big search box there plug your email

615
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,360
address in organ search and uh

616
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,080
their business model was

617
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,559
you can pay some money

618
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:33,679
to get

619
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,360
the entire result of the record in the

620
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,720
data bridge so it's not just like have i

621
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,159
been pine which just answers that

622
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,000
question have i been phone like yes no

623
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,640
then here's the data breaches it's like

624
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,039
okay troy yes you've been in a data

625
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,280
breach here is your first name your last

626
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,320
name your date of birth your ip address

627
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,919
you're actually madison data if it

628
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,760
exists another discussion

629
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,720
uh

630
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,600
all of this came back for a fee and to

631
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,799
make sure

632
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,080
that no one did bad things with it they

633
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,720
added terms and conditions

634
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,480
and they said

635
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,720
by using this service you acknowledge

636
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,240
that you're not going to do bad things

637
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,640
with the data and bad things eventually

638
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,760
boils down to identity theft very

639
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,080
targeted phishing all the sorts of nasty

640
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,200
stuff that we know goes on on the

641
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,600
internet

642
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,159
i think the fact that they advertised on

643
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,559
hacking forums didn't particularly help

644
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:27,919
their case

645
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,679
because their target demographic was

646
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,039
very clearly those were going to take

647
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,960
advantage of other people i actually had

648
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,200
people run my email address through this

649
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,720
and pop up and go hey troy look at all

650
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,320
the data that they've got on you i ran

651
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,240
this i bought your information and even

652
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,760
for me i see a lot of data breaches but

653
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,400
i'm like geez wow that's uh

654
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,320
all right

655
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,400
anyway this is the website now

656
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,280
so

657
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,760
it didn't work out real well for them

658
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,440
and we've got the the ncaa there the

659
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,039
national crime agency in the uk

660
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,640
obviously the fbi and a whole bunch of

661
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,039
dutch and german and other other friends

662
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,960
from around the world

663
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,200
so they got taken down

664
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,799
a couple of kids running a combination

665
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:08,320
between the netherlands and the uk

666
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,640
now this was 2020 it got taken down

667
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,120
there was another one before that

668
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,039
this one here

669
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,919
now this one was uh was leaked source

670
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,840
and this was probably one of the more i

671
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,080
guess early infamous ones

672
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,320
again very similar sort of inspiration i

673
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,760
think there's a big search box there you

674
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,200
put in an email address it comes back

675
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,120
gives you data and it's basically the

676
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,919
same mo like let's get all of the data

677
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,760
we can about people

678
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,440
and then we sell it someone else buys it

679
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,280
and it is kind of fascinating and in my

680
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,159
like mind-wandering moments i think if i

681
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,080
was to take all of the data from all of

682
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,760
the breaches i had and i was compile it

683
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,880
all together

684
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,360
cloud's cheap it's easy to do these days

685
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,039
you do have something that's really

686
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,280
valuable that people will pay for

687
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,799
and you can get it for free because it's

688
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,080
all out there floating around the web

689
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,480
one thing i found very interesting with

690
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,120
these services is they obviously

691
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,600
try very hard not to disclose the

692
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,840
identities of who's behind them

693
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,679
if you find anything to do with contact

694
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,520
us it'll be like proton mail email

695
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,520
addresses

696
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,440
you certainly can't just go to who is

697
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,919
and pull the data of who runs it

698
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,039
and even though they're not running

699
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,480
behind tall hidden services or things

700
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,600
like that they're using service

701
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:26,000
providers that go quite some way to

702
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,960
protecting their identity

703
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,559
and i think the reasons why pretty

704
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,880
obvious obviously didn't really work

705
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,880
in these cases

706
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,480
because certainly we leak info on the

707
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,400
previous page like i said they got they

708
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,440
got arrested didn't work out real well

709
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,039
and for leak source they found the guy

710
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:44,400
running that as well

711
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,480
there's a guy called jordan bloom

712
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,279
and he's in canada

713
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,679
i i found this particularly fascinating

714
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,480
because he's running this service

715
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,360
selling data for the express purpose of

716
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,120
people then using it for identity theft

717
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,799
purposes and things like this and then

718
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,360
he's trying really really hard

719
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,440
not to be found because he doesn't have

720
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,080
any of his data anywhere

721
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,000
and the bit that i find really strange

722
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,320
is like if you're trying to run like

723
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,240
identity theft as a service and you're

724
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,080
making tons of money and you're trying

725
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,320
really really hard not to stick out

726
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,760
don't drive around a bright green

727
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,760
lamborghini

728
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,679
this is kind of obvious like you're 25

729
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:25,039
years old where did you get the money

730
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,960
mate

731
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,919
crypto i don't know

732
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,840
so anyway i've been seeing like all of

733
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,799
these different services stood up

734
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,400
operating in let's call it like a

735
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,640
tangential space to have a big pawn and

736
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,520
then being taken down by law enforcement

737
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,360
and i'm just sort of

738
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,360
waiting

739
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:50,960
now the audio that you can't hear

740
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:53,919
properly was an fbi open up my son found

741
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,679
that thank you very much for that

742
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,279
that sounded really good on my computer

743
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,760
at home but i was eventually like sooner

744
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,440
or later like this is

745
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,360
this is possibly not going to end really

746
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,799
well now of course it is a very

747
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,480
different model i have a vampire just

748
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,760
answers that question i'm very

749
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,240
identifiable and very public about it uh

750
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,559
and i try to do the right thing with it

751
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,559
uh but i did get a a call from the fbi

752
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,159
as it's funny like when you get an email

753
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,000
so you know we're from the fbi so yeah

754
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,919
sure you are so yeah no we're really

755
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,000
oh crap okay

756
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,640
but it was a good thing from the fbi

757
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,559
so what they wanted to do is they said

758
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:29,840
look

759
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,679
in the course of our investigation we

760
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,919
come across a lot of compromised

761
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,679
credentials so we come across a lot of

762
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,080
data let's say a good example is the

763
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,400
emmatec botnet so they got a lot of data

764
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,000
out of emittet which was a combination

765
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,320
of email addresses and passwords

766
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,159
when you imagine the sorts of things

767
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,760
that a law enforcement agency like the

768
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,159
fbi does it's like yeah they do have

769
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:52,640
like loads and loads of interesting

770
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,080
credentials

771
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,520
and i know that there's a little bit of

772
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,279
a predisposition for people to feel very

773
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,840
critical of of law enforcement agencies

774
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,679
working in uh working in the cyber but

775
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,559
their position was if we can give you

776
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,080
this and put it in phone passwords

777
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,400
and then that can stop people using

778
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,240
passwords on other services that have

779
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,080
been compromised

780
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,919
that's good for everybody right that's

781
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,000
really good for everybody

782
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
so this story was about a year ago

783
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,520
when they said look we want to give you

784
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,679
all this data and i'll say okay that's

785
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,200
that's fantastic

786
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,120
and i normally say yes to stuff and then

787
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,240
i figure out how i'm going to do it

788
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,600
later on

789
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,720
and uh

790
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,240
the thing that needed to be done is an

791
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,000
ingestion pipeline so they're saying

792
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,200
look we're going to have like a fire

793
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,279
hose of new passwords we want to keep

794
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:42,480
feeding these through on a regular basis

795
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,960
and to date phone passwords had always

796
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,039
been very much about

797
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,760
let's go through and wait until i've got

798
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,200
enough new data breaches and enough new

799
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,279
passwords that haven't been seen before

800
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,440
fragments take like 100 million new ones

801
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,720
and then i create this great big

802
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,480
monolithic file and i upload it and then

803
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,320
it becomes searchable

804
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,720
so we needed to build a fire hose and i

805
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,480
thought look probably the best way to do

806
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,600
this is to make other people do the work

807
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,520
so i didn't have to do it myself and

808
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,880
because i don't want to pay them i'll

809
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,880
make it open source so this is the

810
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,720
secret story behind it

811
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,080
but no there are other very good reasons

812
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,760
for making open source so i open source

813
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,000
all of the apis for the havoc and

814
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,760
password search

815
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,000
so what that meant is that the community

816
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:24,960
built it

817
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,240
and one person in particular i got a

818
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,679
friend called stefan from a company

819
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,679
called eve online i'll show you eve

820
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,039
online later on some of you probably

821
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,320
know that

822
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,240
so stefan travels in similar circles to

823
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,799
me in terms of cyber security stuff and

824
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,880
and cloud and public speaking and i knew

825
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,120
that he'd do a good job of coordinating

826
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,960
the community and the community together

827
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,200
built the apis to be able to create an

828
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,120
ingestion pipeline

829
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,799
so now we've open sourced all of the

830
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,200
apis that feed the data into the service

831
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,480
but also

832
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,240
open sourced all of the apis that pull

833
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,080
the data back out

834
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,600
because my thinking was is that if we

835
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
can just open source everything

836
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,279
it's not necessarily open source so that

837
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,960
you can see the code and trust it you

838
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,159
don't necessarily know that's what's

839
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,279
deployed

840
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,440
but you can take it run it yourself go

841
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,200
and stand it up in your own azure

842
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,440
functions instance or your own cloud

843
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,159
flare edge nodes

844
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:15,600
so we started doing that and that was

845
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,720
the idea in in may last year and it took

846
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,320
a bit of time because it did take a bit

847
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,200
of community effort a bit of

848
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,640
coordination particularly when you're

849
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,679
dealing with uh with government agencies

850
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:28,320
and then we got through to december just

851
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,880
before christmas in the year just gone

852
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,559
and the ncaa

853
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,799
also wanted to give me passwords which

854
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,320
was very nice and so the ncaa is the

855
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,240
national crime agency

856
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,640
in the uk fbi equivalent

857
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,840
and they said look we've got

858
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,919
585 million passwords we'd like to

859
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:47,039
contribute

860
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:49,200
and 225 million of them had never been

861
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:52,240
seen in haver bempon before

862
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,399
so they provided all that and we rolled

863
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,799
all that in and we launched everything

864
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,559
just before christmas

865
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,520
with

866
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,960
all of the ncaa passwords all the

867
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,399
existing stuff and have a benpo and the

868
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,799
fbi feeding new stuff in

869
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,200
and then all of the code open sourced

870
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,880
so if anyone wants to play with any of

871
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,039
this you can go to github there's a have

872
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,919
a bemponed organization in there

873
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,000
these two repositories have the azure

874
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,200
function

875
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,039
so the azure function is effectively the

876
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,799
origin service which returns the

877
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,600
passwords themselves

878
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,440
and there's also a cloudflare worker so

879
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,520
cloudflare work is like code on the edge

880
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,120
you create a worker it deploys it to

881
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,520
those 270 edge nodes and it actually

882
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,520
operates out there somewhere close to

883
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,159
you as opposed to on the origin service

884
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:37,679
so if you want to build your own

885
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,679
passwords you go and grab those two

886
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,480
repos you can stand up yourself

887
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,399
you know like that the k anonymity api

888
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,840
and the 1.8 billion requests and

889
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,279
everything is great

890
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,799
but being able to go and just run it all

891
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,799
yourself and have no dependency for an

892
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,159
online service

893
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,799
i think is even better

894
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:56,799
and it's quite funny because very often

895
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,480
i'll get something where

896
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,559
an organization will say oh

897
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,480
we want to use your api but we can't

898
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,679
because

899
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:04,960
of the lawyers

900
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,240
but what are they worried about and i

901
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,840
explain the k anonymity and everything

902
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,600
like oh we can't send your path you're

903
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,279
not sending me passwords i can't send

904
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:12,559
you part of a password i can't do

905
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:13,440
anything

906
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,039
just take it you know like it doesn't

907
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:18,240
matter just download yourself and run it

908
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,600
now hot off the press first time i've

909
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,679
shared this publicly just in the last

910
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:22,960
couple of days you'll see the commit

911
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,159
history here pwn passwords downloader so

912
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,399
there is a new project there that allows

913
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,720
you to download all of the hashes that

914
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,039
are in there in the live system running

915
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,559
behind that api and save them offline

916
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,320
so previously there'd be these big

917
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,399
monolithic zip files that you could

918
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:41,760
download and these are the ones where

919
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,840
like it was literally like every i think

920
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,440
roughly nine months i put another one

921
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,640
out there

922
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,559
so now you can run this and it literally

923
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,120
hits the cane anonymity api and it just

924
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,880
iterates through that 16 to the power

925
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,159
five different possible hashes and it

926
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,480
pulls them all down saves them offline

927
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,799
so that's up there live you can grab it

928
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,080
now i've actually got it running at home

929
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,840
first time i ran it this is all stefan's

930
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,880
work and just to put a little bit of

931
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,960
context around how fast these can run as

932
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,960
well we did a challenge recently where

933
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,880
we said okay let's uh

934
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,080
let's see

935
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,480
how fast we can query these can

936
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,120
anonymity apis and we made it a bit of a

937
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,480
public challenge we said look i'll pick

938
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,799
whatever language you choose whatever

939
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,880
you like so that's up there in that path

940
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,399
if you want to go and get it in python

941
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,559
or something like that that's available

942
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,240
the dot net one

943
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,760
that stefan did just to sort of get a

944
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,480
little bit of context around speed

945
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,679
this is what the net one looks like and

946
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,080
the really key number here

947
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,159
is the 13 000 plus queries per second

948
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,159
so imagine we're going to make 13 000

949
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,679
queries per second for passwords

950
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,120
and the way this is being used is

951
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,559
i won't name them but another law

952
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,320
enforcement agency said look we've got a

953
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,240
whole bunch of different passwords

954
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,080
we would like to see if they've been

955
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,679
breached before

956
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:02,080
we can't make it go very fast

957
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,360
like how many billions of dollars have

958
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,799
you got you should be able to figure out

959
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,240
how to do this

960
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,519
we'll open source that and we'll see

961
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,600
what we can do so the reason we created

962
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,679
this is to just see how fast we can

963
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,640
query a password corpus and in stefan's

964
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,039
example here he's thrown 14 billion

965
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,320
passwords at it that's the number at the

966
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,080
beginning to see

967
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,760
now they're in the rock you password

968
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,760
list which is a really sort of canonical

969
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,000
password list from many years ago

970
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,080
but the reason it's so fast is because

971
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,320
of that total possible only like a

972
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,840
million and a bit different queries so

973
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,919
we can cache results

974
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,480
those 14 million passwords have a lot of

975
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,080
common hash prefixes remember there's

976
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,679
only a million different possible crews

977
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:40,960
we can make

978
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,279
so we pull down those results query them

979
00:32:43,279 --> 00:32:46,960
locally and that's why it goes so fast

980
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,039
so the final thing then is like what

981
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,200
does it look like when an organization

982
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,760
integrates phone passwords into their

983
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,440
ecosystem

984
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,679
and i wanted to pick eve online because

985
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,360
it is a

986
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,279
massive multiplayer online game but it

987
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,799
is also a massive service right there

988
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,159
are loads and loads of people that use

989
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,600
even line

990
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,760
account takeover attacks are a massive

991
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,440
thing for them

992
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,200
they've got a lot

993
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,840
of kids using evenline

994
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,360
don't always make the best password

995
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,960
decisions

996
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,159
and there's actually valuable stuff in

997
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,679
here people build up a lot of profile

998
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,360
they build up a lot of like digital

999
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,840
credibility and digital credit as well

1000
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,120
in the service

1001
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,480
so they're always dealing with account

1002
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,919
takeover tax

1003
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,240
so they were one of the first to go and

1004
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,880
implement prone passwords

1005
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,360
under stefan's guidance

1006
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,159
and this is what it looks like

1007
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,600
really really simple the password you've

1008
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,799
chosen is not secure and has been

1009
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,480
identified as risky due to past breaches

1010
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,039
please choose a more secure password

1011
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,039
so they've done a load of research on

1012
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:48,880
this and they've decided where is the

1013
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,640
right threshold you know i don't know if

1014
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,159
it's like one occurrence or three

1015
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,760
occurrences of five occurrences but for

1016
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,919
their demographic and their audience

1017
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:57,440
they've gone okay this is going to be a

1018
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:00,799
threshold we're going to cut off there

1019
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:04,000
okay so i wanted to to try and leave

1020
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,840
time for questions as some on the screen

1021
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,519
i know other people have some questions

1022
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,520
uh also we're going into a break after

1023
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,199
this so we've got time if anyone wants

1024
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,480
to come and chat and i've dumped a whole

1025
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,079
bunch of have i been paying stickers and

1026
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,040
stuff here you're welcome to come and

1027
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,159

1028
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,560
if anyone here has a good question i'll

1029
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,560
give you a 3d printed logo

1030
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,520
have i been phoned

1031
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,440
maybe

1032
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,440
hello can we get the lectern mic turned

1033
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,440
on

1034
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,320
still not

1035
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,000
g'day yeah thanks troy it was a

1036
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,918
fantastic talk uh i wanted to thank troy

1037
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,000
for that

1038
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,879
there there were a few questions um i

1039
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,199
had to uh moderate not really but there

1040
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,199
was one one question um which is

1041
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:58,000
probably more about how you keep um

1042
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,320
have i've been phoned secure i guess

1043
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,320
you might have a lot of um good stuff

1044
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,320
there so they're really trying to do a

1045
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,839
supply chain tactics you do have some

1046
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,760
pretty pretty awesome wiring going on in

1047
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,160
your house also on the twitters

1048
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,079
it's i i think the the answer to keeping

1049
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,760
it secure is it's just a really really

1050
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,760
simple system you know it is it is

1051
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,040
literally

1052
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,400
i guess if we talk about the bigger

1053
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,920
ecosystem i haven't been playing there's

1054
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,599
a bunch of email addresses that exist in

1055
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,359
an azure storage construct there's a

1056
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,240
simple api in front of it uh

1057
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,560
the worst case scenario for have i been

1058
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,880
pwned itself being pwned which would be

1059
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,800
very meta wouldn't it the worst case

1060
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,480
scenario is people get data which has

1061
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,680
been leaked through other data breaches

1062
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,599
and like i don't want that to happen

1063
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,040
i guess it would be easy for me to load

1064
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,320
the data and to have it been fined if it

1065
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,680
happens but

1066
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,280
no look it's it's just a very simple

1067
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,560
system and incidentally there's just

1068
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,240
loads and loads under the hoverbank

1069
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,160
hashtag in my blog explaining the

1070
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,400
architecture

1071
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,920
and i've got one other question it's

1072
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,800
actually for your son

1073
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:58,680
do you know your dad's password

1074
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,400
good i thought i'd have to pay you

1075
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,839
that's good everyone wants to thank troy

1076
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,200

1077
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:08,520
