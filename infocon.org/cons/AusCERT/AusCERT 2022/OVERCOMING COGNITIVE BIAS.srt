um thank you all for coming i'm actually

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,039
very surprised i was almost hoping for

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,840
no one turning up and then i could just

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,080
go outside again but no thanks for for

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,560
coming today um i am firstly going to

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,400
start by acknowledging the traditional

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,479
custodians of country throughout

15
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,239
australia and their connections to land

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,559
sea and community i pay my respect to

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,719
their elders past and present and extend

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,640
that respect to all first nations people

19
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,280
that may have joined us today

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,360
so let me just get this set up a little

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,800
bit better so i can see what i've

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,279
written here

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,000
so

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,559
cognitive bias cognitive bias in

25
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,640
security teams so if there's one thing

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,879
that you need to know about biases or

27
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,399
biases is that everybody has them we all

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,600
have them

29
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,280
but when we see the word bias in the

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,520
media it's usually

31
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,520
in connection with something

32
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,000
nasty or terrible like somebody didn't

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,360
get a job because of of their gender or

34
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,040
law enforcement has arrested someone

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,360
because of their race or nationality so

36
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,880
we tend to think of people who have

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,439
biases in a negative way and they're

38
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,520
people that take extreme actions to

39
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,040
exclude others

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,040
no one really wants to admit that you

41
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,720
have a bias

42
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,240
but our biases

43
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:34,960
can and often lead us in directions that

44
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,759
we don't expect and that we may not even

45
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,680
intend

46
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,840
we might even disagree with them

47
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,240
for each of us our individual biases

48
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,399
drive our everyday decisions from where

49
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,159
we sit on the bus like hands up if you

50
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,439
get on the bus and you kind of look

51
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,799
around and you're like

52
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,920
no i'm not gonna go sit next to him uh

53
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,520
you know she looks all right i'll go sit

54
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,159
next to her all based on purely just on

55
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,840
you know what they look like um i do

56
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,520
that um where we buy our coffee from

57
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,520
i'll also admit to going to

58
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,200
if i have a choice of cafes i'll

59
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,880
probably choose the cafe that's got

60
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,720
maybe an italian or a hipster looking

61
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,840
barista

62
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,840
um

63
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,120
doesn't mean that they make coffee

64
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,800
better because they have a moustache but

65
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
um and even which cubicle we use in the

66
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,400
bathroom i don't know if anyone else as

67
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,879
well you tend to well for the women the

68
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,959
ladies here you tend to go to the same

69
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,520
one every time for whatever reason

70
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,879
um bec

71
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,120
choosing the same seat

72
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,239
here today several times over

73
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,080
so these biases are based on many

74
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,160
factors and that includes our upbringing

75
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,560
belief systems personal experiences and

76
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,000
education

77
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,319
so in general uh people are creatures of

78
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,720
habit as i've just kind of talked about

79
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,280
so you're generally going to like who

80
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,879
here gets a different coffee every time

81
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,040
they go to a cafe

82
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,239
or do you get the same coffee every

83
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:55,920
single time wow

84
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,879
do you like mix it up with one or two i

85
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,239
do two

86
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,159
different things

87
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,879
nice

88
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,000
yeah out of the room of what 20 people

89
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,720
one in 20 we'll do something different

90
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,720
um so but usually

91
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,080
you know you find that mixture of

92
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,159
ingredients that you like and you keep

93
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,599
doing that and you stick with it

94
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,400
however in business

95
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,879
the stick to what you know mentality

96
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:26,879
often means that we're hiring the exact

97
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,159
same people

98
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,000
over and over

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,799
the thinking often is that if employee x

100
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,879
or if shanna is doing a great job and

101
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:38,000
everyone gets along with shanna

102
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,040
agree

103
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,840
um

104
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,480
then we'll look for more shadows to hire

105
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,680
and then we'll end up with a team of

106
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,760
exactly the same people

107
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,200
um you tend to look for the same

108
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,400
educational backgrounds skill sets um

109
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,239
you source them from the narrow like a

110
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,840
narrow set of companies when you go out

111
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,840
and you're looking to approach people as

112
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,360
you know if you're hiring manager you do

113
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,720
do that you get on linkedin and you're

114
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,680
off there

115
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,879
you will choose a certain set of

116
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,640
companies that you think ah people from

117
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,920
that company are going to be pretty good

118
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,239
i'm going to go for them

119
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,760
and you look for similar personality

120
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,159
traits during interviews you know if you

121
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,680
get along with them and why you get

122
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,599
along with them so before you know it

123
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,440
everyone acts and thinks like you

124
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,478
generally or to a degree someone in your

125
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:24,560
team or the act almost exactly the same

126
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,080
but if you have a security team

127
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,280
workforce that thinks and acts the same

128
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,040
how can you be sure that the decisions

129
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,919
made

130
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,759
and the actions taken are really the

131
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,520
best decisions

132
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,800
just because we've done it that way for

133
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,560
20 years doesn't mean it's the best way

134
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,120
to do things for the next 20 years

135
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,199
and so our biases affect these decisions

136
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,360
that we're making every day in our jobs

137
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,080
the decisions can and often affect the

138
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,840
security of an organization and i've got

139
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,759
some examples that are going to come up

140
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,000
so if we want to ensure that these are

141
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,440
well thought out and researched

142
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,680
decisions being made building diverse

143
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,440
teams can go a long way to achieving

144
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:00,560
that

145
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,919
so what i would actually like you to

146
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:03,360
take away today is that there are things

147
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,880
that we can do as individuals you know

148
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,960
we always ask what can we do what can i

149
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,759
do

150
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,680
to acknowledge the part that we play in

151
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,199
the broader community

152
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,280
and the biases that affect us

153
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,039
not just gender bias i'm talking about a

154
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,199
different a whole other lot of biases

155
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,960
i'm also not perfect i have my own

156
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,680
biases i succumb to them all the time i

157
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,280
have my own faults

158
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,960
i'm not perfect nobody's perfect it's

159
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,639
just about being aware

160
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,560
it's about finding the best way to

161
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,639
challenge yourself and your organization

162
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,039
to do better and work beyond our biases

163
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,360
to create create better teams i'm also

164
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,360
not a psychologist or psychiatrist and

165
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,800
i'm the second person on this stage that

166
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,240
i know of that said that over the last

167
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,080
two days jp was here

168
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,400
yesterday um

169
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,240
this is all based on research that i've

170
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,520
conducted

171
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,320
probably about 100 open chrome tabs that

172
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,520
may or may not have repeats um so filled

173
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,880
with research and opinions of other

174
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,600
people plus my own experience

175
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,919
i've been in information security for

176
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,919
around 21 years now so it's um been a

177
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,759
long journey um and one that's still

178
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,120
going and i'm quite happy to continue it

179
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,520
so what is implicit bias or cognitive

180
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,120
bias um they involve the associations

181
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,280
outside of our awareness that lead to

182
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,160
negative evaluation of a person on the

183
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,199
basis of irrelevant characteristics so

184
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,720
you don't like someone because they have

185
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,880
curly hair or

186
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,360
you don't like them because they you

187
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,280
know walk a certain way something like

188
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,039
that it's really relevant to the kind of

189
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,639
person that they are

190
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,479
but in the hustle and bustle of our

191
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,880
lives everyone's really busy our mental

192
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,039
energy is probably one of our most

193
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,520
important assets and currencies that we

194
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,919
have so in order to preserve our

195
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,039
cognitive

196
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,520
resources our brain takes shortcuts and

197
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,280
these shortcuts are

198
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,840
the cognitive biases so

199
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,720
um

200
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,880
while these preconceptions do not

201
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,479
necessarily reflect

202
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,960
reality or rationality in these

203
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,560
decisions

204
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,639
we rely on them to expediate and

205
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,479
simplify information processing in our

206
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,720
brain so these biases influence and

207
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,319
affect not only the way we think and

208
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,520
behave but also our decision-making

209
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,400
processes um

210
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,720
these biases have also been a large part

211
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,880
of our survival mechanism for humans

212
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,880
over the over the years you know hear a

213
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,759
raw you run you don't think about it

214
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,360
um but i do have a little short video

215
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,599
that i'm going to play

216
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,520
let's see if you've probably heard the

217
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,199
big news about the boy scouts this is a

218
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,440
big story uh last week the organization

219
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,080
decided to allow girls to join

220
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,599
and they officially changed their name

221
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,560
to just scouts

222
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,800
now of course

223
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,800
of course a lot of people have opinions

224
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,319
about this and they're wondering if

225
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,639
making the organization co-ed is a good

226
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,840
idea

227
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,039
we haven't talked about it yet what do

228
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,280
you what do you think andy

229
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,360
i i don't want to sway anyone's opinion

230
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,440
but i did get my hands on some footage

231
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,879
from the co-ed scout camp

232
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,319
i think a lot of you will find it very

233
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,120
troubling take a look

234
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,240
which one of you did this

235
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,400
hi i'm andy richter and i'm here to talk

236
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,039
to you about implicit bias

237
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,559
if you watch that clip and assume the

238
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,159
owner of the curling iron would be a

239
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,120
girl

240
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,320
then you just showed implicit bias

241
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,120
something to think about

242
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,440
okay i think we got it let's give it up

243
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,120
for my camera operator sam

244
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,720
hi me again

245
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,120
and if you assume my camera operator sam

246
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,839
was a man you've once again shown

247
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,080
implicit bias

248
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,880
check your bias

249
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,399
okay guys we're really done now i have

250
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,440
to take my car to the mechanic

251
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,399
yes

252
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,800
my mechanic is a woman damn it people

253
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,800
this is exhausting

254
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,200
i'm spending the rest of my day fighting

255
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,020
against gender inequality

256
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,160
[Applause]

257
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,760
that video actually gets super weird

258
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,120
after that point i know i shared it with

259
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,480
bex it was like i'm just going to cut it

260
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,560
off there beyond that is like a bit

261
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,680
strange

262
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:28,560
um but if these biases are implicit or i

263
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,240
don't like using the term unconscious

264
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,080
bias because it kind of makes it sound

265
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,760
as if it's unconscious and we can't do

266
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,839
anything about it but how do we break

267
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,680
them and how is it relevant to us in the

268
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,399
security industry

269
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,560
oh is it not going to work yes

270
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,200
nope that's backwards

271
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,680
well that was a failure of a pen um so

272
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,680
implicit bias can affect the security of

273
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,000
your organization

274
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,720
so

275
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,040
if implicit bias affects the decisions

276
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,480
made by individuals and security teams

277
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,720
then that also shows that that will

278
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,800
affect this security and potentially the

279
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,279
security of the entire organization

280
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:06,720
and this is what i'm kind of here to

281
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,160
talk about today which is you know me

282
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,800
finally getting to the point and

283
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,680
um revealing the rest of the slide so

284
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,920
if we think about this for a moment um

285
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,160
these decisions so decisions like it's

286
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,399
that person who closed the alert

287
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,120
um because yesterday they had a same

288
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,360
alert yesterday it was a false positive

289
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,519
probably probably a false positive today

290
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,320
i'm just gonna act that and close it

291
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,839
you know the person who's at reception

292
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,760
who lets in the person dressed as an

293
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,440
electrician because yesterday there was

294
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,880
building works going on in the server

295
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,360
room so we'll let them in today because

296
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,680
you know they left their screwdriver or

297
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,040
something behind

298
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,120
and so these those decisions are based

299
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,800
on that particular individual's thought

300
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,040
process thought processes which are

301
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,279
based essentially on a whole bunch of

302
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,600
life factors and they have the ability

303
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,959
to then

304
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,360
impact what happens so what if that

305
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,200
wasn't a false positive

306
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,880
this time and that

307
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,279
that alert could have saved or alerted

308
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,600
to a ransomware attack that that

309
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,360
electrician might have been a pentester

310
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,600
from mercury iss

311
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,440
and uh

312
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,959
and they drop a raspberry pi in your

313
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,839
server

314
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,720
so it's critical to evaluate individuals

315
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,399
and team members holistically when

316
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,399
you're building out security teams

317
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,519
particularly those charged with

318
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,920
protecting organizations and or

319
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,480
conducting investigations too

320
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,320
and so how do you become aware of your

321
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,839
own biases

322
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,200
it's really easy to call out other

323
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,079
people i know i'm pretty good at that

324
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,320
but it's a bit difficult to notice our

325
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,839
own biases

326
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,839
it becomes challenging to recognize and

327
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,480
actually acknowledge these behaviors in

328
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,920
ourselves

329
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,720
so

330
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,639
but when we become

331
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,200
aware of these shortcomings we can then

332
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,760
use what we have discovered in ourselves

333
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,440
to help our leadership style or

334
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,560
correct or potentially stop uh

335
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,720
discriminatory behaviour

336
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,040
in ourselves and also in others

337
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,480
so it's a little bit about paying

338
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,560
attention to your thoughts

339
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,399
examining your beliefs

340
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,519
and

341
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,279
just identifying some assumptions that

342
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,880
you currently hold

343
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,839
so

344
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,839
anyone here if you see someone in a

345
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,000
meeting and they don't speak up you've

346
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,519
asked around

347
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,279
do you immediately assume that because

348
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,639
they haven't spoken up they might be

349
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,519
uninterested or maybe they don't speak

350
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,920
up because they don't feel comfortable

351
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,240
a lot of people would take the the

352
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,360
former

353
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,880
oh well they didn't say anything they're

354
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,399
clearly uninterested and they don't have

355
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,440
an opinion and it may not be that way

356
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,519
what about if you showing signs of

357
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,839
emotion in the workp the workplace like

358
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,200
crying

359
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,040
generally that is treated as a sign of

360
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,880
weakness um

361
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,880
doesn't need to be

362
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,880
people who miss deadlines

363
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,800
um do you just automatically assume that

364
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,160
they're unproductive or incapable or do

365
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,639
you have the ability to go and look at

366
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,399
why they actually have missed those

367
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,839
deadlines and maybe listen to their

368
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,519
reasons

369
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,519
so according to a 2012 yale university

370
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:12,639
study

371
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,800
male applicants were more likely to be

372
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,639
hired and with a higher salary than

373
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,079
female applicants and i mean we've all

374
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:20,079
heard this right so this is in spite of

375
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:21,200
having otherwise identical

376
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,800
characteristics and there's been studies

377
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,440
where they have identical cvs applying

378
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,040
for the same roles

379
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,440
um and the one with the man usually gets

380
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,440
the interview

381
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,959
there's an economist called daniel

382
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,639
hammamesh and he has a book called

383
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,920
beauty pays

384
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,279
why attractive people are more

385
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,279
successful and claims that beautiful

386
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,360
people make on average during their

387
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,279
lifetime 250 000 more than

388
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,360
unattractive people i don't know you

389
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,800
know who sets that

390
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,639
um definition

391
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,320
and there's a book called the power of

392
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,880
thinking without thinking uh by malcolm

393
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,880
gladwell and he writes that in the u.s

394
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,600
population there's about 14. 14.5

395
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,320
percent of all men are six foot or over

396
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,199
so

397
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:05,760
not a huge amount but among ceos of

398
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,319
fortune 500 companies that number is 58

399
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,279
so because we are by definition unaware

400
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,279
of our automatic unconscious beliefs and

401
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:16,399
attitudes

402
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,279
we

403
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,440
believe we are acting in accordance with

404
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,079
our conscious intentions when in fact

405
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,160
it's generally our unconscious that's in

406
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,079
the driver's seat so it's possible for

407
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,560
us to treat others unfairly

408
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:33,119
even if we believe we are wrong to do so

409
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,560
and so if it shows that our biases are

410
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,240
made from how we are brought up the

411
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,040
books we read the school we went to

412
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,240
our social circle um i know i'm in a bit

413
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,399
of a vacuum when it comes to facebook

414
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,160
and you know that bit of an echo chamber

415
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,040
of um my social circle in that regard

416
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,279
the media we read and then it's a

417
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:55,120
logical next step that people from

418
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,800
different backgrounds are going to have

419
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,480
different biases

420
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,440
and

421
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,639
but that will bring a different

422
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:02,480
perspective to the table

423
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,959
so some of these biases that are at play

424
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,279
here

425
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,480
right

426
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,639
so my favorite one first and i think

427
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,000
it's my favorite one because it's

428
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,639
probably the one that i'm least

429
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,839
um

430
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,000
what would you say bex

431
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,120
it's probably the one i have least

432
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,040
problem with authority bias i have

433
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,079
absolutely no issue whatsoever

434
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,639
telling someone higher up than me to

435
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,399
f off

436
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:33,279
um so authority bias is our

437
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,759
natural tendency i did have a little bit

438
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,440
too much prosecco last night our natural

439
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,160
tendency to follow the leader

440
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,320
and there's a quote i quite like have no

441
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,120
respect whatsoever for authority

442
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,279
forget who said it and instead look what

443
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,519
they start with where they end and ask

444
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,399
yourself is it reasonable

445
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,600
evolution has selected us and has a you

446
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,399
know

447
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,320
selected for a deep respect for

448
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,600
authority

449
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,800
um society compounds this by organizing

450
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,639
and supporting this tendency into the

451
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,240
dominance hierarchy and you think about

452
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,199
how we generally work in you know board

453
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,920
ceo management levels under that and

454
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,120
it's also you know think about that

455
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,759
statistic of the height of male ceos in

456
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,320
fortune 500 companies as well

457
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,079
um you know people over six foot are

458
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,279
seen

459
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,680
generally speaking not everyone as more

460
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,199
dominant

461
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,120
you're taught to respect authority from

462
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,440
a very early age you see authority

463
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,519
figures everywhere as a kid teachers

464
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,839
parents older siblings coaches

465
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,320
grandparents politicians celebrities and

466
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,160
then again as an adult you know your

467
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,519
boss their boss the ceo the board

468
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,079
it's all built into our

469
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,120
social structures essentially

470
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,040
so this story that i'm going to tell now

471
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,920
is not cyber security related and

472
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,600
it'll get to a cyber security point

473
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,160
eventually but we go back in time to

474
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,120
january 25th 1990 and it was a routine

475
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,839
flight from bogota colombia to new york

476
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,920
it was avianca flight 052 does anyone

477
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,760
know this story

478
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,520
good

479
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,280
so the aircraft left bogota without

480
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,520
issue um i say that without issue there

481
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,280
were actually issues with the plane

482
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,559
itself there were a bunch of things that

483
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,640
were going wrong but that that is sort

484
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:20,400
of not the point but it comes back to um

485
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,480
uh

486
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,640
a few things anyway along the way there

487
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,919
was bad weather

488
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:26,959
so

489
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,720
they needed to do you know holding

490
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,320
patterns everyone knows what a holding

491
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,840
pattern is where they have to go around

492
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,080
and waste some time that obviously uses

493
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:34,960
fuel

494
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,039
so they've had to do two holding

495
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,799
patterns on the way up

496
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,600
and

497
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,960
knew that there was bad weather at their

498
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,840
destination however along the journey no

499
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,600
one's actually told any of the air

500
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,679
traffic control along the way

501
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,200
that they could potentially have fuel

502
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,799
issues

503
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,840
so when they arrived in jfk in new york

504
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,000
the first officer asked was asked if

505
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,240
they could do another holding pattern so

506
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,919
the first officer replied that they had

507
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,320
only five minutes left of fuel

508
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,480
but you gotta think english is a second

509
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:07,600
language a bit of poor communication

510
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,039
um

511
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,720
the captain actually then still

512
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,559
attempted to land the plane knowing that

513
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,799
they didn't have a lot of fuel but with

514
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,480
the bad weather he couldn't actually

515
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,840
land the plane and actually almost

516
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,720
crashed about two miles off from the um

517
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,120
runway so they pulled up and did a go

518
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,039
around procedure um i've done some of

519
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,760
those at canberra airport it's not fun

520
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,120
so

521
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,160
the

522
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,240
first captain didn't express any concern

523
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,280
to the atc the air traffic control about

524
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,960
the fuel situation in a way that air

525
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,960
traffic control would understand they

526
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:42,720
never talked about it being an emergency

527
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,880
they never mentioned to air traffic

528
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,480
control during the first two holding

529
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,120
patterns that they would run out of fuel

530
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,799
at some point and could possibly have

531
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,720
landed somewhere earlier

532
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,880
they failed to use the word emergency

533
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,799
the captain had asked the first captain

534
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,039
to tell them it was emergency however

535
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,360
the first captain did not

536
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,480
and so the

537
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,720
air traffic controllers involved

538
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,039
didn't hear the word emergency they

539
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,880
heard priority

540
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,640
and they didn't realize

541
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,240
that it was actually an extreme

542
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,360
emergency

543
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,120
so during that go around procedure the

544
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,880
aircraft ran out of fuel lost all

545
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,039
engines and flew into a nearby hill so

546
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,640
it killed 73 out of 158 on board

547
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,720
so where am i going with this

548
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:25,520
um

549
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,120
again another little tangent i like

550
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,640
tangents but every country has a

551
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,039
different level of respect for authority

552
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,039
um the dutch social psychologist gert

553
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,280
hofstetter came up with a power index

554
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,559
power distance index so a pdi and that

555
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,760
is indicates how well do people in a

556
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,559
certain country or background follow

557
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,799
orders from an authoritative figure so

558
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,880
the higher the pdi value the more

559
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,520
respect they show authority so colombia

560
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,679
is high up on that list in terms of they

561
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:54,480
show

562
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,440
a lot of respect to authority the us is

563
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
a lot lower on that list and therefore

564
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,200
the people in the u.s and air traffic

565
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,280
control would have expected that the

566
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,840
first captain would have talked back and

567
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,039
said no we need to land now

568
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,200
we have to have priority

569
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,280
unfortunately that didn't happen

570
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,880
um the co-pilot did not talk up did not

571
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,400
talk back or did not challenge the

572
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,520
authority of the air traffic control

573
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,840
so cyber security and authority bias and

574
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,919
how can that be affecting us so business

575
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,400
email compromise bbcs these scams are

576
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,840
probably one of the most financially

577
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,240
damaging cyber crimes um nearly 2

578
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,280
billion in 2020 is there any

579
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,320
bigger statistics than that bex

580
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,600
the biggest

581
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,200
yeah

582
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,840
yeah huge um but in many cases it

583
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,840
actually uses authority bias as a mean

584
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,080
to defraud users so for example

585
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,240
employees in the fight an employee in

586
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,760
the finance department receives a

587
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,360
fraudulent email

588
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,640
purporting to be the ceo asking for some

589
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,640
money to be transferred into an account

590
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,679
or i've seen in my friends organization

591
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:04,320
uh they were asked to change um the bank

592
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,080
account details for the cf or the cto

593
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,480
for payroll

594
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,919
so often

595
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,440
times especially if you're looking at

596
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,799
people from countries with a high pdi

597
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,200
they won't question they will do what

598
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,880
they think that the big bosses said them

599
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,200
to do

600
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,039
so

601
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:26,799
in that

602
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,799
have you ever considered or has anyone

603
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,639
ever heard of the pdi index

604
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,120
do you ever consider that hiring are you

605
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,919
do you hire people i don't i haven't yet

606
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,799
but yes

607
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,440
yes so it's you know maybe consider that

608
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,880
when you're hiring a team and you're

609
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,600
looking at people's backgrounds um and

610
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,760
then consider a little more

611
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,039
is what about the women from those

612
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,640
countries you know always going to bring

613
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,400
it back to the women um

614
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,159
but a woman in those countries are

615
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:57,280
probably going to have double the

616
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,080
challenge when it comes to

617
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,559
their ability to talk up so when

618
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,080
you know you have somebody maybe in a

619
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,919
meeting who's not talking up maybe it

620
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,000
isn't the fact that she doesn't want to

621
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,280
say anything she just doesn't feel

622
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,720
comfortable because that's not how she's

623
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,200
been brought up um so i'm not saying

624
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,440
don't hire people obviously from

625
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,679
a country with a high pdi

626
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,760
um but it's just recognizing as a

627
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,799
manager or even as you know a colleague

628
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,240
that these biases biases exist in people

629
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,080
and

630
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,120
it isn't necessarily a bad thing

631
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,120
but we do need to know about it and the

632
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,919
diversity of culture in teams can help

633
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,000
to combat this

634
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,600
so there might be another person who

635
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,200
knows that she won't speak up and will

636
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,360
speak up on her behalf just because they

637
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,600
know she's afraid to

638
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,000
next one is the recency effect bias and

639
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,919
they're all up on the screen yet

640
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:50,880
um

641
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,320
did you know

642
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,919
that most security teams admit to

643
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,679
ignoring one-third of all security

644
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,360
alerts since a majority of them are

645
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,360
false positives

646
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,400
i might ah probably

647
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,080
um i don't know where that statistic

648
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,360
came from either

649
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,080
it's just i liked it anyway um we've all

650
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,400
heard the term light fatigue

651
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,280
it's a pretty obvious one um and this is

652
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,159
a

653
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,640
recency bias or an example of a recency

654
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,559
bias

655
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:20,320
and i would have loved to get the x c so

656
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,640
from target up here to talk about it

657
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,240
but he couldn't he couldn't make it here

658
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,919
today so i'm going to share his story

659
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:26,960
with you

660
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,679
um as best i can

661
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:33,520
so it was an alert called malware.binary

662
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,039
generic

663
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,799
not much information was provided by the

664
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,559
fire appliance

665
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,760
but still

666
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,919
it alerted on it right so he knew that

667
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,880
there was something not quite right

668
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,400
same alert happens

669
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,880
same alert happens quite a bit

670
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,200
usually it's a false positive so it was

671
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,400
ignored

672
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,559
so it's likely that the security team at

673
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,080
target actually received hundreds of

674
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,000
these alerts making it extremely tough

675
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,600
to have singled out this one threat

676
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,799
which actually turned out to be

677
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:02,159
malicious

678
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,600
and this is a quote

679
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,760
through our investigation we learnt that

680
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,279
after these criminals entered our

681
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,440
network a small amount of their activity

682
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,840
was logged and surfaced to our team

683
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,080
that activity was evaluated and acted

684
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,960
upon

685
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,240
snyder said

686
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,760
based on their interpretation and

687
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,840
evaluation of that activity the team

688
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,600
determined that it did not warrant

689
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,480
immediate follow-up

690
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,720
um firearm also has a function that

691
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,480
automatically deletes

692
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,320
uh malicious software but that's usually

693
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,640
turned off by security teams i don't

694
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,000
tend to keep it on because of the false

695
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,200
positives so

696
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
they're more concerned about

697
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
you know a file

698
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,279
and that's all good i'm gonna i should

699
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,840
be all right maybe

700
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,720
i'll just continue outside um yeah more

701
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,679
concerned about

702
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,080
[Laughter]

703
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,799
malicious files or files non-malicious

704
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,440
files being

705
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:02,640
deleted and impacting the business

706
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,640
so it happens quite often if you're in

707
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,640
an invest in an investigation yesterday

708
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,720
you see something odd you look into it

709
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,320
it was benign tomorrow you're probably

710
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,240
going to make that same decision

711
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,679
um you can say we can tune the lights

712
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,600
better and all the rest of that um but

713
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,440
this is a bias that can actually affect

714
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,440
decision making um and it's actually why

715
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,600
i hate closing alerts too um but

716
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,960
obviously as everyone heard of the

717
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,520
target breach many many years ago

718
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,080
that was a really bad piece of malware

719
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,039
and

720
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,520
yeah that cso lost his job

721
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:32,799
so that sort of thing happens all the

722
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:33,600
time

723
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,400
uh automation bias so it's basically

724
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,840
relying on

725
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,039
automated scanners outputs um equifax

726
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,039
breach there was a vulnerability in the

727
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:45,679
apache apache struts um that's a web

728
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,120
framework for developing java

729
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,039
applications so

730
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,880
the patch was released for this on march

731
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,320
7th 2017 there was known exploits in the

732
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,159
wild so the news was to patch

733
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:57,600
immediately

734
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,360
the equifax administrators were told to

735
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,600
apply the patch to any affected systems

736
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,200
they ran a scan

737
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,039
no systems came back

738
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,840
to say that they needed patching

739
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,480
the web portal that was breached in may

740
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,480
2017

741
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,480
was not alerted that it was actually

742
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,600
vulnerable

743
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,320
so in september 2017 equifax announced

744
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,679
that it had become the victim of one of

745
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,919
the largest data breaches of all time

746
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:23,279
and the total cost of that breach is

747
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,159
estimated to have been 1.4 billion

748
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,200
um

749
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,880
so relying heavily on automated scans um

750
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,440
we don't rely on one tool generally in

751
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,919
our job doing digital forensics

752
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,679
did they even check that the scanner was

753
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,120
up to date did they check that it was

754
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,240
configured to scan all of the systems um

755
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,320
they just let it run no we're fine you

756
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,440
know

757
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,520
scanning one host no not vulnerable

758
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,720
is that cynic in me again so how did we

759
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,240
become biased kind of talked about that

760
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,320
what are our influences

761
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,240
um

762
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,640
it's a bit like so what i'm gonna go

763
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,720
what can make us aware

764
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,640
it is a bit like substance abuse right

765
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,080
the first step is admitting you have a

766
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,960
problem

767
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,720
so if you don't know what we need what

768
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,799
you need to change how do we change it

769
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,799
um given that we surround ourselves by

770
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,760
like-minded people

771
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,320
we need to pay attention to our thoughts

772
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,039
examine our actions our beliefs

773
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,640
how do you react to people from

774
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,159
different backgrounds think about it

775
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,360
when you are looking at resumes or

776
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,880
you're looking at people to join the

777
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,880
team or your colleagues

778
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,480
do you hold any stereotypes or

779
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,080
assumptions about a particular social

780
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,320
group

781
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,640
how do you acknowledge and leverage

782
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,880
differences in the team

783
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,279
and do you put yourself in the shoes of

784
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,880
someone else to empathize with their

785
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,760
situation even if you don't relate to it

786
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,279
and i know i'm running out of time but

787
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,520
there i have a test a couple of like is

788
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,039
this a bias test

789
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,720
so would you consider yourself you don't

790
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,000
need to put your hands up because you

791
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,679
know it might be embarrassing would you

792
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,520
consider yourself being biased by giving

793
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,279
a job to a candidate you clicked with

794
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,200
just because you went to the same school

795
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,279
or interested in the same hobbies and if

796
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,200
they are different gender or ethnicity

797
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,440
from from you so you're hiring them they

798
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,440
might be different gender different

799
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,440
ethnicity you get along because you have

800
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,520
the same hobbies is that a bias still

801
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,360
yes it is still a bias

802
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,640
um

803
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,880
it is an affinity bias

804
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,320
so it's favoring someone based on

805
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,440
something

806
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,799
something that you have in common with

807
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,880
them

808
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,080
and i'm going to skip that one i'm going

809
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,399
to go to this one actually i would like

810
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,840
if you if you're brave to put your hand

811
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,880
up because i find this a really

812
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,880
interesting one if one of your employees

813
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,960
returns from maternity leave

814
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,880
is it unconscious bias to spare her the

815
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,640
trouble of going on business trips or

816
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,960
taking on extra responsibilities

817
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,720
would you spare them or would you not

818
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:48,020
put your hand up if you would spare them

819
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,600
[Laughter]

820
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,960
so

821
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,880
yeah it is a bias it's a benevolence

822
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,399
bias you basically you think you might

823
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,960
be doing them a favor um by sparing her

824
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,200
the extra stress however that's for her

825
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,720
to decide and not you

826
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,799
um just because maybe your wife your mum

827
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,120
your sister whoever wanted to take time

828
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,200
off after they had a child doesn't mean

829
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,960
that everybody else does so

830
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,600
this can affect somebody's career if

831
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,480
you're

832
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,520
oh i'm not going to give them that

833
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,039
opportunity for a promotion i'm not

834
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,399
going to give them that opportunity to

835
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,240
travel because they've just had a child

836
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,760
it can be detrimental to somebody's

837
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,279
career

838
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,200
um ways to measure

839
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,159
our you know if we need to do something

840
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:29,840
like this we also need to measure it and

841
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,559
measure our success so

842
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,559
you can measure in a lot of different

843
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,520
metrics start with the basics

844
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,120
look at your gender diversity look at

845
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,360
your cultural diversity

846
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,799
religions backgrounds

847
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,039
look at the equity of salaries across

848
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,880
the organization and the groups within

849
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,720
the organization

850
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,559
look at the creativity and productivity

851
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,000
coming out of teams and look for a way

852
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,919
to measure that so that you can actually

853
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,159
start to track and measure how diversity

854
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,760
can impact

855
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,159
those teams and people within those

856
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,039
teams

857
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,880
and analysts such as forrester and

858
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,320
gartner will actually tell you that this

859
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,880
stuff really matters so

860
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,480
employees

861
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,559
and customers actually care about this

862
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,159
stuff um

863
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,640
pen 10 has some statistics on there just

864
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,080
a shout out for pen 10 i don't work

865
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,760
there i'm not affiliated with them in

866
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,279
any way but they actually have some of

867
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,559
their diversity

868
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,159
statistics on their website um and well

869
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,760
it's not a huge amount of detail it's a

870
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,279
really good start and i encourage you to

871
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,279
take a look and maybe help

872
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:32,720
um

873
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,159
if you're doing the same thing how long

874
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,960
do i have not long four minutes all

875
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,039
right so

876
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:40,480
i've had it all i want to hire the best

877
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,080
person for the job whether it be a man

878
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,039
or woman

879
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:44,159
you probably just got hired for a

880
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,840
diversity target

881
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,120
hiring the best person for the job

882
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,480
actually means hiring the best person

883
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,480
for the team and so building the best

884
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,760
team means ensuring that there is

885
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,960
diversity

886
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,720
um working with people who are different

887
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,720
from you can challenge your brain and

888
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,120
overcome stale wells stale ways of

889
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,519
thinking and jasmine said it yesterday

890
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,120
and don't take offense to this people

891
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,000
but it was a pale male stale so let's

892
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,399
get over these stale ways of thinking

893
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,080
it can challenge

894
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,240
the team to think better

895
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,240
there are a lot of

896
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,080
studies out there that show diversity in

897
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,600
teams

898
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,240
teams with diversity outperform other

899
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,559
teams um

900
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,880
companies with women on boards do

901
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,720
financially better than companies who

902
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,559
are all male things like that there are

903
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,240
hundreds of

904
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,200
surveys statistics reports all of that

905
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,320
stuff

906
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,919
so diverse teams are more likely to

907
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,519
constantly re-examine the facts and

908
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:40,080
remain objective

909
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,399
um it's not easy to build a diverse team

910
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:44,320
never said it was you need to go out of

911
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,960
your way to actually make it happen if

912
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,559
you don't have any diversity in your

913
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,799
network you need to go out and fix that

914
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,320
and change that and find a way to

915
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,279
actually

916
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:56,159
make your your hiring pool more diverse

917
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:58,000
um avoid trying to hire someone hire

918
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,760
someone for a culture fit what the

919
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:02,000
is culture fit anyway um your culture

920
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,519
may not be the culture that i want to be

921
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:04,240
in

922
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,080
it can be really vague

923
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:10,000
don't use it as a hiring metric

924
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,679
and be willing to try

925
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,279
just give it a go

926
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,559
you can only

927
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,679
go better or fail right so you know look

928
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:19,760
for those people who are going to make

929
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,600
contribution to the compute community

930
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,440
contribution to teams

931
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,200
um if you build the right team that

932
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,840
culture will

933
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:30,080
come so

934
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,080
also if someone calls out your

935
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,399
unconscious biases don't get defensive

936
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:36,640
try and take it as a learning experience

937
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,440
reach out to a diverse group of peers to

938
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,840
understand how they perceive you and

939
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,559
seek continuous feedback um embrace

940
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,159
diverse perspectives

941
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:47,760
if your close circle looks just like you

942
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,120
it's time to build a more diverse

943
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,320
network

944
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,240
i've pretty much spent my entire career

945
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,880
fighting biases the way i look the way i

946
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,120
talk act um

947
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,640
the fact i'm female

948
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,720
i'm pretty open

949
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,360
and loud mouthed and

950
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,720
not many people like that um

951
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,720
but

952
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:11,840
it hasn't stopped me

953
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,519
and i'm still here and i hope that it

954
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,880
doesn't stop anyone else in this room

955
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,919
either

956
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:18,240
um be your authentic be your authentic

957
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,480
self uh build empathy have

958
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,880
self-reflection and educate yourself to

959
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,559
lead a diverse and inclusive and equal

960
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:27,679
team

961
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,080
that's all

962
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,320
uh we've got a couple of minutes

963
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,240
so we can probably do a couple of quick

964
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:42,240
questions um if anyone has any

965
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,519
uh just wondering in in small teams um

966
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,559
where

967
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,399
um maybe you've only got the opportunity

968
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,120
to to hire a graduate someone without

969
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,559
too much experience and maybe without

970
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:03,039
the confidence to challenge how do you

971
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,640
how do you train them how do you build

972
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,679
their

973
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:07,679
their confidence

974
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,918
without passing on your own

975
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:12,079
biases so how do you have your tools or

976
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,320
techniques to help with that i think for

977
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,879
me it's about empathy so putting

978
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,719
yourself in their situation and not just

979
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,639
being i don't respond well like i said

980
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,480
before i don't respond well to authority

981
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,679
or being

982
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,560
kind of

983
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,399
told that the way i do things is not the

984
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,480
way that you need to be doing them um so

985
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,079
fostering

986
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,480
their learning and allowing them to

987
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,239
learn in the way that that is the best

988
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,000
way for them to learn if they're a grad

989
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,199
they're not going to have confidence we

990
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,879
all know i mean i've been in this

991
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:40,960
industry for 21 years and i'm still not

992
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,480
confident i'm still shooting myself

993
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,280
upstairs before this right um

994
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,000
confidence is going to take a long time

995
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,239
to build but it's if you've got a

996
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,239
supporting manager that

997
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,918
isn't putting you down every time you do

998
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:55,599
something wrong or isn't putting you

999
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,599
down because you don't talk up that will

1000
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,240
give them the confidence to start

1001
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,040
building their own presence um in their

1002
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,440
own way

1003
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,160
i think we've got time for one more

1004
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,520
quick question

1005
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,520
anyone

1006
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,920
shannon you might remember me we spoke

1007
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,000
together at crest earlier this year and

1008
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,400
to declare to the room i'm sociologist

1009
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,040
oh that's right yes because you did some

1010
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,280
advice oh my gosh

1011
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,359
i'm glad i didn't realize that before i

1012
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,280
started

1013
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,680
it's okay um one of the key things i

1014
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,520
think needs to be added is the optimism

1015
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,480
bias

1016
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,480
right so that's in cyber security that's

1017
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,320
particularly a strong one where the

1018
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,320
boards and the executive think that

1019
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,040
they've invested in the techies right

1020
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,480
that they know how to do their job and

1021
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,440
we're going to trust that they're going

1022
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,599
to do it yeah right and then from the

1023
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,359
techies perspective it's like well would

1024
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,160
this potentially happen to me or not not

1025
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,880
likely when we look at it 88 of people

1026
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,400
think they have optimism bias they do

1027
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,400
not think it will happen to them in

1028
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,000
terms of an attack yeah so it might

1029
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,960
happen to the organization next to me or

1030
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,079
last year i sat in this room and

1031
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:07,760
presented and and got people to think

1032
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,079
about covert right from optimism

1033
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,960
perspective and i said who here thinks

1034
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,200
they're not going to get covered and

1035
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,480
most people thought it was going to be

1036
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,160
the person next to them like nearly

1037
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,240
everyone raised their hand and said i

1038
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,599
won't get it but the person next to me

1039
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,599
might get it so just in terms of cyber

1040
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:24,400
security i think it's a really

1041
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,400
additional one to add because we all

1042
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,480
sort of think it won't happen to me

1043
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,320
and um we kind of know a little bit that

1044
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,720
it might but we tend to operate more on

1045
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,040
that 88 of us yeah more on that it won't

1046
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,160
happen to me

1047
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:40,680
so that was great cool thanks

1048
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,000
uh give it off a shout out everyone

1049
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,760
thank you thanks for coming and hanging

1050
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,760
around

1051
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,040
