organizers for tuscon which is the

26
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,160
sunshine coast's premiere conference

27
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,559
say that very loosely um

28
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,480
just a reminder there is a q a app so if

29
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,320
you haven't downloaded it already please

30
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,879
do uh it just allows you to kind of ask

31
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,800
questions throughout the presentation as

32
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,319
well i don't know about you but

33
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,640
sometimes i forget what my what my what

34
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,080
my question was earlier in the

35
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,560
presentation and then you know i'll have

36
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,360
to

37
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,439
ask the person later on so it's going to

38
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,840
be used for q a but if you do have any

39
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,280
questions throughout in the room i'm

40
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,479
going to be roaming around with a

41
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,880
handheld mic please wait for me to come

42
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,799
to you in order to ask the question just

43
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,159
so that people tuning in on a live

44
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,680
stream can actually hear you as well

45
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,520
we've all seen those youtube clips where

46
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,960
you don't hear the question you hear the

47
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,200
answer and you have a zero context

48
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,079
so without with all that aside i like to

49
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,799
introduce bex knighter

50

is awesome

63
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,399
so crime cybercrime something i've been

64
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,360
into for quite a long time now and was

65
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,920
what got me interested in doing digital

66
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,200
forensics in the first place uh

67
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,640
kind of started off with a

68
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,040
credit card fraud got interested in that

69
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,120
then workplace

70
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,959
misconduct

71
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,959
finally found a university course that i

72
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,080
liked

73
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,120
and

74
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,560
cybercrime became a real thing and so

75
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,560
that's what i dig

76
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,959
so about me you already heard about me

77
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,599

00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,480
australian-wide

91
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,360
please support them um

92
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,239
uh euphemisms

93
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:18,400
uh criminals use them quite a lot to try

94
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,760
to kind of

95
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,680
downplay the the badness in what they do

96
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,879
and i'm using one here

97
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,440
i don't stalk cyber criminals i spoil

98
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,799
them

99
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,040
because you know stalking is such a

100
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,720
weird thing right

101
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,400
so i i don't want to be a stalker

102
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,879
because that's just weird and talking

103
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,360
about weird i'm also really not crazy

104
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,400
digging holes in my backyard um i felt

105
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
like i had to actually include these

106
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,920
slides because

107
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,959
the people at the uh digital forensics

108
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,640
tutorial that we did

109
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,480
on tuesday

110
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,920
kind of missed out in a bit of the

111
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,560
context and most of the talks that i do

112
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:02,159
i include this because it does provide a

113
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:02,959
good

114
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,159
analogy of the work that i do

115
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,400
i don't dig holes in my backyard without

116
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,959
a purpose well maybe i do but you know

117
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,720
it's a good way of getting away from the

118
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,400
computer but

119
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,320
typically there's something i want to

120
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,600
achieve

121
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,358
maybe there's a dead patch in the grass

122
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,880
and i think

123
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,160
maybe there's something causing that

124
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,400
dead pouch that i start digging

125
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:27,040
and i start finding random stuff

126
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,440
in my backyard including bones

127
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,360
as you can see there

128
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,880
some bricks

129
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,919
clothing

130
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,160
wallets

131
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,160
luke skywalker

132
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,759
that muppet thing that i can't remember

133
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,600
the name of

134
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,479
also find really cool stuff

135
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,680
and this is the cricut trophy from

136
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,680
1930s

137
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,680
still can't work out what qriket club

138
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,440
it's from

139
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,880
but you know this is kind of my day job

140
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,160
as well

141
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,919
you know i find a lot of crap when i'm

142
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,479
digging around people's computers

143
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,680
but i also find a lot of really

144
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,360
interesting things as well and a lot of

145
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,479
things that

146
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,400
are really cool but

147
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,759
you don't know

148
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,400
how it got there or you know necessarily

149
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,680
what it is because you don't have the

150
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,360
context around it um but that's what you

151
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,479
know makes my job really interesting so

152
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,800
constantly you know seeking out things

153
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,639
and finding things and trying to work

154
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,080
out what they are and sometimes you

155
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,000
don't have the answers but that's okay

156
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,600
it will just drive you insane for years

157
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,479
like this thing has

158
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,759
so

159
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,000
what am i doing what have i been doing

160
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,800
for probably way too long now

161
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,919
not stalking a cyber criminal it's not

162
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,240
what i'm doing at all

163
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,880
we had a client that came to us after a

164
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,479
fishing incident

165
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,960
and it was a chained attack so

166
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,240
one employee actually got phished via

167
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,039
their personal email account

168
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,639
but they put in their business email

169
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,639
credentials which resulted in their

170
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:06,720
business email account being taken over

171
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,280
their account was then used to

172
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,280
proliferate uh

173
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,800
you know more phishing

174
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,520
emails within the organization

175
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,440
wasn't over the top

176
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,280
you know maybe a quarter of the

177
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,600
organization at that stage

178
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
but got more accounts compromised and

179
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,160
this is this is a very common theme with

180
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,080
phishing emails unfortunately not many

181
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,319
organizations actually take the time

182
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,600
to investigate at this stage um

183
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,960
it's not until

184
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,840
you know

185
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,520
somebody's transferred money to the

186
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,680
wrong account or there's been a

187
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,639
ransomware attack or you know

188
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,319
something else has gone wrong that they

189
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,479
actually bring people in to investigate

190
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,639
there was one instance

191
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,240
where in a similar attack

192
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,560
there was about 20

193
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,880
of the organization's user accounts were

194
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,440
compromised within 12 hours it actually

195
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,880
would have been less

196
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,880
if there wasn't that gap where people

197
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,639
were sleeping

198
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,160
i think

199
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,960
so 20 of the user accounts were

200
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,400
compromised

201
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,360
and their it

202
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,440
service provider only picked up 60

203
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,960
of those compromised accounts

204
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,880
a year later

205
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,400
they discovered that there were auto

206
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
forwarding rules

207
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,280
kind of pushing out all of these emails

208
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,440
no idea whether that was the fishing

209
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,080
incident that caused it there were so

210
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,280
many

211
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,160
but

212
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,319
you know it kind of goes to show that if

213
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,039
you don't actually follow through and

214
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,639
investigate fishing incidents properly

215
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,199
a lot can slip through the cracks

216
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,639
and some of the

217
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,879
i guess

218
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,280
techniques have evolved over the years

219
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:00,479
as well and the fishing actor

220
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,560
that i'll be talking about today has

221
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,360
been using that a lot to compromise

222
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,360
organizations

223
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,199
so

224
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,280
opsec is

225
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,240
always amazing with criminals isn't it

226
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,639
they never publish anything

227
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,800
online about what they're doing

228
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,479
who they are

229
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,800
what they're eating for dinner

230
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,360
nothing like that um

231
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,120
so

232
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,360
the organization

233
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,240
that

234
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,599
engaged us to investigate after they'd

235
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,080
had the phishing incident

236
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,640
through information sharing within the

237
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,080
information security community

238
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,440
i knew

239
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,800
what cluster

240
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,519
of activity this phishing attack

241
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,680
had originated from

242
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,120
so

243
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,480
i already had a bit of background

244
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,720
knowledge on you know

245
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,800
how they operated and what you can

246
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,720
expect and

247
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,880
they heavily abuse

248
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,279
cloud services so if they compromise

249
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,560
your

250
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,279
office 365 credentials they're likely

251
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,040
going to upload

252
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,399
things like

253
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,560
pdfs or

254
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,320
dot url files to onedrive to users urls

255
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,440
in

256
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,800
further phishing

257
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,399
attacks so

258
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,560
um already had a you know fairly good

259
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,560
idea about the way that they operated

260
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,600
but towards the end of the engagement

261
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,240
uh the legal firm that had engaged us

262
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,080
said

263
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,399
could you look into them a bit more can

264
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,120
you tell us their motivations and you

265
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,480
know

266
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,000
about what they might do with

267
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,240
information if they got it you know what

268
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,920
are their intentions

269
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,080
and so i started digging

270
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,000
and i found a lot more than i expected

271
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,560
i found the guy's real name his address

272
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,480
you know he's just

273
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,480
all out there and

274
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,440
you know

275
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,800
more than

276
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,720
well it's definitely more than 10 years

277
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,680
worth of illicit activity online now

278
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,800
so

279
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,720
fishing isn't necessarily a sexy topic

280
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,800
ransomware is the thing

281
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,240
but fishing leads to

282
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,079
a lot of you know the most high impact

283
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,720
uh types of you know cyber crime that we

284
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,519
experience uh business email compromise

285
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,200
romance scams

286
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,760
property scams it's you know

287
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,720
initial access brokers commonly sell

288
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,279
stolen credentials onto ransomware gangs

289
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,240
so

290
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,040
by not taking phishing seriously

291
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,040
you know we're hurting

292
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,440
individuals we're hurting companies

293
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,399
we're hurting national security overall

294
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,040
so we really need to take it seriously

295
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,200
and unfortunately there are people out

296
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,079
there that are making fishing very

297
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,040
easy

298
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,399
for people to do

299
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,680
in fact

300
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,120
you can outsource fishing to them

301
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:03,839
so

302
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:06,240
uh the particular actor that i'm looking

303
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,880
at he actually runs

304
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,040
an outsourced

305
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,720
kind of

306
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,480
i guess fishing operation he not only

307
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,320
allows you to buy

308
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,519
templates for various types of uh

309
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,839
you know fishing sites which will be

310
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,120
used for various uh reasons you know

311
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,800
if you're fishing for dating sites

312
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,279
you're probably going to be undertaking

313
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:32,959
romance scams

314
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,440
if you're you know fishing for

315
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,440
real estate related

316
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,279
you know credentials you're probably

317
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:41,600
going to engage in some kind of either

318
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,519
payment diversion fraud through

319
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,279
settlement agents or property scams

320
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,720
and of course

321
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,079
quite obviously

322
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:52,560
office 365 and other

323
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,519
business related credentials

324
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,639
you're going to want to be getting

325
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,600
access to companies data

326
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,360
so

327
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,720
this is the

328
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,959
trajectory of

329
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,000
basically

330
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,040
the phishing actors

331
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,279
i guess career

332
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,639
progression

333
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,480
it's uh you know

334
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,399
started getting interested in cyber

335
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,200
crime when i was you know getting pretty

336
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,839
damn interested in cyber security you

337
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:22,800
know we've

338
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,760
both traveled along the way and moved up

339
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,480
in the world and you know having great

340
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,720
success he does get paid a lot more than

341
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,200
me though

342
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,399
so

343
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,120
in 2015 that's when the first evidence

344
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,800
i could find

345
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,120
of him actually starting to market his

346
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,000
services online on

347
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,160
underground criminal forums essentially

348
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,519
saying hey you know you can purchase a

349
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:52,800
fishing

350
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,320
page from me

351
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,560
or a letter which is the kind of email

352
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,000
that would get sent through again

353
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,480
another euphemism

354
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,000
you know it's not a phishing email it's

355
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,200
a letter

356
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,639
um

357
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,800
i don't know why they bother seriously

358
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,000
um

359
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,399
so he he was actually working at a

360
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,800
internet cafe at the time had been

361
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,399
employed it's not like you know there

362
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,360
were

363
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,639
you know unemployment issues

364
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,959
he admitted to actually

365
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:25,680
committing his first

366
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,040
i guess

367
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,440
cyber attack when he was working at an

368
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,120
internet cafe against one of their

369
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,480
customers

370
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,519
and

371
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,920
he was socializing with a lot of cyber

372
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,760
criminals as well

373
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,000
massive group

374
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,160
all engaged in various types of cyber

375
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,839
crimes so whether it was

376
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:46,800
scams denial of service attacks

377
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,360
hacktivism that kind of thing so

378
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,519
you know it's just this big social thing

379
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,519
where everyone was just encouraging this

380
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:54,880
behavior

381
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,320
and he

382
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,800
you know he was quite outgoing

383
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,959
active on these forums helping people

384
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,240
out marketing himself being you know

385
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,240
pretty reasonable guy

386
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,720
um you know if he wasn't involved in

387
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,320
crime you'd probably be like yeah he's

388
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,959
cool dude let's hang out at the bar and

389
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,320
you know

390
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,519
he's actually pretty at you know

391
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,240
coding and stuff but anyway

392
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,800
um you know as long as you can fake it

393
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,440
till you make it i guess

394
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,959
so um he set up a e-commerce site

395
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,680
on you know normal web

396
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,600
google accessible

397
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,120
2018

398
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,199
um

399
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,279
has remained up

400
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,399
it's just

401
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,600
there

402
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,680
search for it find it

403
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:47,040
buy some fishing templates

404
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,639
he then expanded into providing

405
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,040
essentially a managed service

406
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,160
so

407
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,330
you could pay him

408
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:56,720
[Music]

409
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,680
it's

410
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,240
getting close to 2 000 us dollars a

411
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,160
month now

412
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:05,040
to do the fishing for you

413
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,560
so

414
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,560
he'll have the template he'll have the

415
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,160
websites

416
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,480
he'll send the emails he'll collect the

417
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,399
cred logs and he'll send them through to

418
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,079
you at the end of the week

419
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,639
i don't know what he does during that

420
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:21,600
week but anyways um

421
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,360
might be used

422
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,440
uh probably double dips a bit um

423
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,680
but yeah he makes a decent amount of

424
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,880
money and over time he's employed people

425
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,040
he's got an accountant

426
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,240
hired off freelancer

427
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,880
hired developers he's got you know

428
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,440
people to help doing with you know tech

429
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,199
support and

430
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,079
it's

431
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,800
run like a legitimate business he's

432
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,759
introduced automation so that if fishing

433
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,759
links go down

434
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,079
you can just log into a portal click a

435
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,880
button it refreshes spins up new

436
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,680
phishing sites auto magically

437
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,079
and then you just go and send out more

438
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,680
phishing emails

439
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:09,199
it's just fabulous it's just i know

440
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,959
they do it better than some businesses

441
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,079
so

442
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,440
doing really well

443
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,199
um

444
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,519
so

445
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,880
i don't know why

446
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,399
but

447
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,199
he issues invoices to customers

448
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,600
for the illicit services that he

449
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,880
provides

450
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,680
um

451
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,240
has also used paste bin

452
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,040
as some kind of i don't know record

453
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,920
keeping kind of thing i don't know it's

454
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,279
like music itself dude um

455
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,600
it you know at least make it easier for

456
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,560
me

457
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,440
to

458
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,040
just calculate everything that he's

459
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,880
doing rather than having to

460
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,279
put everything in excel and

461
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,320
you know

462
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,680
have it all standardized but um

463
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,160
this data is from

464
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,000
uh january

465
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,160
well end of december january february um

466
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,599
i collected

467
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,799
uh

468
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,480
last year

469
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,439
uh

470
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,919
quite a significant amount of money and

471
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,480
you can see that most of his income is

472
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,959
actually coming through the managed

473
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,760
fishing services so a decent amount of

474
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,480
criminals are paying him to do the work

475
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,799
for him i'm not entirely sure whether

476
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:26,480
he's actually

477
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,679
you know

478
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,440
doing individual things for each

479
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,000
customers i'm pretty sure he just sends

480
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,919
all the same logs to all of the

481
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,640
customers and you know it's a pretty

482
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,039
you know decent deal for him and

483
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,559
i don't know they

484
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,640
seem to trust him i guess they keep

485
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,919
paying him

486
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,440
but through the introduction of his

487
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,480
managed service his his income has just

488
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,480
skyrocketed because

489
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,480
you know for the same period the year

490
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,679
before

491
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,480
you know it was ten percent of that

492
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,120
so he's just

493
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,280
shut off absolutely

494
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,880
um

495
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,559
so the really great thing

496
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,679
with him

497
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:06,400
is

498
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,039
so in the invoices that were published

499
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,720
to

500
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,799
online file sharing company that

501
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,799
happened to

502
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:17,360
stumble across

503
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,960
he's got

504
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:19,840
you know

505
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,960
the name

506
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,880
of the customer not necessarily real

507
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,559
name but an alias

508
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,320
uh you know

509
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,120
the amount that they spent if they used

510
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,000
uh bitcoin it's got bitcoin transaction

511
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,039
id

512
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,679
and the address that it's gone to

513
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:37,679
uh which is really handy

514
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,120
uh

515
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,720
and you know that was super useful

516
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,200
and in the more recent

517
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,600
tran transactions that occurred last

518
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,039
year

519
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,120
he's got the icq numbers or aliases

520
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,120
skype aliases telegram aliases

521
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,360
the email accounts where

522
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,240
the

523
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,360
credential logs are sent to the bitcoin

524
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,840
transaction ids if they paid in perfect

525
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,559
money then you know what their perfect

526
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,840
money account was it's just like

527
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,120
holy moly

528
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,160
and

529
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,799
put it all together i've got hundreds of

530
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:20,240
customers with their email addresses and

531
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,799
you know it's just insane

532
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,400
and so

533
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,080
through the information that he's

534
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,440
published

535
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,400
i

536
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,760
got several

537
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,160
bitcoin addresses which you can cluster

538
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,760
into what you can

539
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,520
think is probably going to be the same

540
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,840
wallet

541
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,039
the

542
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,160
the kind of

543
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,799
big cluster up the top where you've got

544
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,200
a lot of the blue lines

545
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,360
that was a single address that was used

546
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,720
between 2015 and 2018 and at that point

547
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,760
in time

548
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,240
uh so the the blue lines are essentially

549
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,080
where the money's flowing out

550
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,600
so you can see that

551
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,120
you know he's

552
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,200
kind of buying lots of things with with

553
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,440
bitcoin at that stage bitcoins fairly

554
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,520
low value so you know let's go buy a

555
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,720
pizza or whatever and i don't know

556
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,000
something like that i assume um but he

557
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,080
does purchase a lot of things with

558
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,640
bitcoin including other illicit services

559
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,360
and his hosting and things like that

560
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,559
um

561
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,400
but the ones down the bottom

562
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,039
uh all from basically last year i

563
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,240
haven't

564
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,480
done too much in

565
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,960
this last 12 months but

566
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,440
you know he's he's just released so much

567
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,840
information it's amazing

568
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,120
um

569
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,799
and through

570
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:43,919
uh the information that he has disclosed

571
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,720
i've discovered that if you have

572
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,720
an md5

573
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,840
hash

574
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,480
of the email account that he's

575
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,559
associated with the purchase you can

576
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,480
often link that to

577
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,480
a particular phishing page for those

578
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,880
customers that aren't actually

579
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,039
managed you know they they haven't

580
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,559
bought that managed service they've just

581
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:05,919
bought the

582
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,480
the fishing page that he hosts and

583
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,280
kindly has that automated regeneration

584
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,120
of of link thing so

585
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,360
there's actually a way to

586
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,039
link particular phishing campaigns

587
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,640
to particular

588
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,159
actors and some of these actors have

589
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,640
been using the same emails for

590
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,880
many years it's quite amazing so

591
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,000
can you imagine how much evidence

592
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,159
there would be there

593
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,679
so

594
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,360
this guy

595
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,080
has about 10 000 registered users in his

596
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,640
newly revamped shops so in about a year

597
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,960
he's got 10 000

598
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,679
users some of them are going to be

599
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,919
law enforcement and people gathering

600
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,000
intel and security companies and things

601
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,360
like that keeping an eye on what's

602
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,400
happening

603
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,240
as he starts to expand his services

604
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,440
um

605
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,799
might as well just stay there because

606
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,960
it's pretty picture i like telling

607
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,039
stories about him he's pretty cool

608
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:08,400
um

609
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,080
so uh

610
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,559
this year he's actually expanded into

611
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,760
sms

612
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,799
fishing

613
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:17,120
so he now provides the infrastructure to

614
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:20,320
do sms fishing which is pretty cool

615
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,159
well you know first customers anyway

616
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:26,000
maybe not for us i haven't seen uh any

617
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,960
of the sms fishing coming through in

618
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,960
australia but who knows

619
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,360
um but you know when i do i'll be like

620
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,000
oh happy days kind of you know i just

621
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,760
get excited over things i shouldn't be

622
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,400
excited about

623
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,760
i think i'm going all right for time

624
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,039
yeah

625
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:47,280
cool

626
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,080
so i did say that i was

627
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,919
going to talk about what we can do about

628
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,150
cybercrime

629
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:55,919
[Music]

630
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,640
what do we do

631
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,640
cybercrime's such a huge area

632
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,240
one of the

633
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,360
concerns that i have about

634
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,200
operations

635
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,960
like this guys

636
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,120
is that it's actually making it really

637
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,320
easy for kids to get involved so some of

638
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,880
his customers are children

639
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,360
and that is quite disturbing for me and

640
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,480
we we see that children are involved

641
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,039
um quite a bit in cyber crime we've got

642
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,480
lapses

643
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,000
which brett

644
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,799
spoke about yesterday

645
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,799
but

646
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,600
one of his highest paying customers is

647
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,159
actually 15 years old

648
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:40,960
so

649
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,799
he's getting to that stage now where

650
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,880
he's actually you know starting to

651
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,320
accumulate

652
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,480
enough wealth where

653
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,520
you know

654
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,640
he can

655
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,400
afford

656
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,200
you know a place to rent in sydney

657
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,320
and

658
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,360
you know

659
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,679
isn't doesn't have a real job but

660
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,480
you know and everyone else is struggling

661
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,360
um

662
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,200
it's kind of disturbing and

663
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,480
it's difficult for law enforcement to

664
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,679
crack down

665
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,200
on these things there's so many

666
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,679
operations happening and so many

667
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,559
different competing priorities and

668
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,240
even if you can give them all the

669
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,600
information

670
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,200
in the world

671
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,520
things take time

672
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,080
i don't know how to solve that problem

673
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,400
i wish i did but

674
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,080
one of the things that i would really

675
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,360
like to see

676
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,799
industry do

677
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,640
is start to share more information on

678
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,799
these things and particularly

679
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,400
reporting

680
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,159
when they are being impacted because

681
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,960
it would be less than one in five uh

682
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,880
victims of cybercrime that are actually

683
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,120
reporting that they have been a victim

684
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,799
if you're not reporting that you've been

685
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,240
a victim

686
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,400
cases become a lower priority we don't

687
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,799
understand what's going on we you know

688
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,960
don't have that data to go on to

689
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,720
actually quantify

690
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,400
what harm

691
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:07,760
criminals are you know causing to us so

692
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,760
it's really important that we actually

693
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,400
start talking about it like it's okay it

694
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,679
happens

695
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,240
all right like

696
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,679
we've got you

697
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,360
you know we care about you please share

698
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,919
i know that's easier said than done

699
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,080
but if we don't start sharing this

700
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,400
information and we keep all of this

701
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,400
crime kind of hidden under the rug it's

702
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,159
kind of like you know domestic violence

703
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,080
you know if if people aren't talking

704
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,400
about there's nothing we can do about it

705
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,480
so you know some it's a stigma that we

706
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,640
need to remove if we're actually gonna

707
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,520
you know

708
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,919
really get ahead of it

709
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:45,200
um

710
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,559
obviously mfa come on guys

711
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,240
seriously

712
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,640
i think microsoft released a report

713
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,279
saying that only 20

714
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,279
of organizations have adopted it and

715
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,919
it's been around for so long why

716
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,159
you know we're doing rethink reskill

717
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,360
reboot

718
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,640
but

719
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,320
there's all this stuff

720
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,039
that's just the basics that people still

721
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,039
aren't doing and mfa will protect

722
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:13,760
against so many of these attacks and

723
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,840
it's just please

724
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,120
um

725
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,360
but there there is uh one practical

726
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,480
thing that i do want to show

727
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,000
because it's something that i see

728
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,279
people

729
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,320
kind of

730
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,960
fail to take into account and probably

731
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,679
don't do every day

732
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,440
um if they're investigating

733
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,039
um

734
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,960
security incidents

735
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,320
so does anyone know of url scan

736
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,039
a few people so url scan dot io

737
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,279
see if i can

738
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,600
all right

739
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,760
so you can see that i'm just gonna

740
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,799
refresh because i did this last night

741
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:03,600
see if it works

742
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,080
of course going to come up with some

743
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,240
that probably don't work

744
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,600
um

745
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,960
but

746
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,919
as i was saying when

747
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,080
these phishing attacks occur they quite

748
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,360
often exploit your own infrastructure to

749
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,960
you know conduct further phishing

750
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,080
attacks

751
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,120
so

752
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,360
say i have oh dear

753
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,440
look we've got a swim burn one should i

754
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,840
click it

755
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,720
this one probably won't work actually

756
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,960
based on the way that it's looking

757
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,960
sorry the link has expired

758
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,200
um

759
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,000
i wasn't expecting an australian company

760
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
that's we've got a

761
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,679
we've got a new zealand company though

762
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,520
here we go all right

763
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,399
cool

764
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:49,440
so

765
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,760
this

766
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,640
is the result of a phishing attack

767
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,559
that

768
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,799
view proposal document there that's

769
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,559
hosted in onenote

770
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,480
will contain a link

771
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,440
to a site to steal credentials

772
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,159
so

773
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:08,240
if you're investigating a phishing

774
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,559
attack in your organization

775
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,159
how many of you

776
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,480
look to see whether files have been

777
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,760
uploaded

778
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,399
to

779
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,559
the compromised users

780
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,760
onedrive

781
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,120
onenote

782
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,879
anything that they have access to

783
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,480
not enough

784
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,200
i'm saying that now because

785
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,480
i

786
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,120
come across this so often

787
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:36,240
and i'll call up the companies local

788
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,039
governments governments

789
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:40,159
and say

790
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,559
hey you've got fishing lures

791
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,880
hosted on the infrastructure

792
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,760
you know you've been fished oh yeah yeah

793
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,399
that happened that happened a week ago

794
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,559
like okay well

795
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,120
it's still there

796
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,600
can you do something about it like

797
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:00,159
oh but you know it's okay you know we're

798
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,080
not the first and we won't be the last

799
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:05,200
i'm like no no no no no

800
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,640
please

801
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,679
um

802
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,279
it's really hard to get people to listen

803
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,120
to you when you're trying to help you're

804
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:15,440
just like you just please take this down

805
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,120
um i don't know if they think you're

806
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,640
trying to scam them or sell them

807
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,159
something it doesn't help that work for

808
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:22,559
a cyber security company i guess but you

809
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,840
know trying to do the right thing

810
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,679
because the longer these things stay

811
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,360
online

812
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,960
the more people

813
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,919
that will get phished

814
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,480
so this example unfortunately the way

815
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,559
that microsoft kind of structures their

816
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,360
pages it makes it very difficult for

817
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,279
services like url scan to directly pull

818
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:45,120
the links

819
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,440
from the documents

820
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,679
so

821
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,120
did i

822
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,200
so this is another one

823
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,880
go back to the summary

824
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,240
so

825
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,200
um

826
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,679
if you know your my

827
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,919
sharepoint.com

828
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:06,799
url domain

829
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,480
i would strongly suggest that you

830
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,600
regularly

831
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,399
search for this in services like url

832
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,520
scan um not only might you pick up

833
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:17,120
instances where

834
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,480
you have

835
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,320
fishing lures hosted there but you also

836
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,840
might find that there's actually some

837
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:22,799
leaked

838
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,120
data so someone might not have

839
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,559
appropriate sharing permissions and

840
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,320
someone's just gone and scanned it in

841
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,240
url scan and then suddenly you've got a

842
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,399
list of documents and people know what

843
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,799
link they can go to to then access some

844
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,399
files there's actually a link on there

845
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:41,840
that i won't go to but it looks like a

846
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:46,000
data room for some kind of probably

847
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,399
m a deal

848
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,799
maybe not something the lawyers will be

849
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,240
impressed with

850
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,520
um

851
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,200
so anyways

852
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,640
this one here

853
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,960
it's pretty crap but you know some are

854
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,720
some are pretty decent

855
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,000
um

856
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,200
but thankfully uh in this case under

857
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,559
links

858
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,720
uh you can see that

859
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,960
it's pulled out the links from

860
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,039
from the uh the fishing law that's been

861
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,960
hosted in onedrive

862
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,240
um

863
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,799
i know because i clicked earlier

864
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,600
prepared earlier um that this one no

865
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,600
longer works um

866
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,000
when it was scanned initially in url

867
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:26,880
scan

868
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,519
but this bottom one does

869
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,120
and we've got

870
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,720
another

871
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,840
phishing thing here right so

872
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,120
sign up with

873
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,159
office 365 or other email they like to

874
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:42,559
make these multi-purpose

875
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,120
so that if you don't have office 365

876
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,120
well we can just uh

877
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,200
get what other other credentials you've

878
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,480
got that's cool

879
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,519
we'll take what we can get

880
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,519
so this this is

881
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,840
you know similar to the actor that i'm

882
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,080
talking about they all kind of copy each

883
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,880
other's stuff it gets reused it's just

884
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,159
you know

885
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,960
they do have patterns though so even if

886
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,880
things look the same

887
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,360
they're generally not

888
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,600
but another good thing

889
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,480
depending on the page if you click on

890
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,880
the dom

891
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,960
see some funky source code

892
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,559
for load

893
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:26,399
i think i did prepare it earlier as well

894
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:29,840
though just in case

895
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:34,240
so depending on how they've set it up

896
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,360
this is

897
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:40,000
can everyone see that

898
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,279
all right

899
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:43,360
um so that's where the credentials will

900
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,960
get posted to

901
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,919
right

902
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,480
you'll find that quite often

903
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,600
across

904
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,960
multiple

905
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,559
phishing pages

906
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:53,760
there'll be

907
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,039
the same

908
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:59,039
domain and php file that credentials are

909
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,240
posted to

910
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,360
so

911
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,760
if you're trying to

912
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:04,799
kind of

913
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,840
lock a spray and pray campaign that is

914
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,799
just

915
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,840
blasting you with all these unique urls

916
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,919
for fishing pages

917
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:15,519
you know blocking each one of those

918
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:16,559
isn't

919
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,000
very efficient

920
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,559
if you take that extra step to go

921
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,200
through and find where the credentials

922
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,960
actually go to

923
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,600
and and block traffic

924
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,640
with that

925
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,480
you know so

926
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,440
i don't know who legitimately uses dns

927
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,640
but you know

928
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,880
you could at least block that

929
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,760
um the credentials won't make it to the

930
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,279
criminal

931
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:42,159
so

932
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:43,200
you know

933
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,120
if this same criminal is spraying

934
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,080
hundreds thousands tens of thousands

935
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,000
hundreds of thousands of employees in

936
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,480
your organization and all the

937
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,080
credentials are being

938
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,840
sent to that

939
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,559
one url php file which

940
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,960
generally has a mailing script that will

941
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,720
you know email off

942
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,639
um that saves a lot of time

943
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,159
take that little bit extra effort

944
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,199
you know there's a lot of things that

945
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,679
you can do to to really make security

946
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,199
easier for you

947
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,119
and i do find that people aren't taking

948
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,079
the extra time maybe it's slas or kpis

949
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,719
but uh you know look for those lures and

950
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,159
files

951
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,800
certainly make use of url scan if you

952
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,760
provide a service that allows people to

953
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,879
host

954
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,599
content on your

955
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,399
you know website or whatever for free

956
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:41,040
also make use of url scam because your

957
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,399
service is probably being abused as well

958
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,719
so you can actually it's like this

959
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,480
crowdsourced

960
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,119
kind of you know threat feed ah cool

961
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,800
we're hosting fishing pages maybe we

962
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,079
should take them down

963
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,040
um

964
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,839
and i'll leave it there now leave it

965
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,599
there

966
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:02,599
um

967
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,640
i will put my thank you page up though

968
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,560
because you can't end without a thank

969
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,560
you page

970
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,839
thank you very much

971
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,480
round of applause everyone

972
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,560
there are a few questions online so

973
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,920
thank you everyone for submitting it

974
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,440
through the app

975
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,960
uh but i will run around so i want to

976
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,880
get my steps up today as well

977
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,240
um so

978
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,400
i'll go from uh first to last so was it

979
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,480
difficult to identify the offender's

980
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:37,440
real name or was it in the who is record

981
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,400
who is

982
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,200
who is brilliant

983
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,720
that goes what's up number two if you

984
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,839
want to give them a call

985
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,880
would like to know more about what open

986
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,320
source tools that can be used to do

987
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,640
these investigations

988
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,839
um

989
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,359
well there's many

990
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:58,960
um

991
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,680
url scans my favorite because it tends

992
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,280
to actually have

993
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,280
quite a lot of like

994
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,079
there's many apis hooked into url scan

995
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:11,200
so if you're you know fading malicious

996
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,720
urls into other sandbox environments is

997
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,200
typically getting pushed to url scan so

998
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,839
it's it's pretty good actual centralized

999
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:23,200
repository but you can search

1000
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,599
so you know like there's hatching triage

1001
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:31,440
joe sandbox any run it's just

1002
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,720
hybrid analysis there's so many

1003
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,040
and i've been using all of these

1004
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,079
services to go back in time and look at

1005
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,680
fishing pages back 2017

1006
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,040
you know it's just

1007
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,359
full of stuff there's so many things out

1008
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:48,720
there so

1009
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,680
probably carry on forever about that

1010
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,079
the next question is has this person

1011
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,800
been prosecuted no

1012
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,480
no

1013
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,599
hopefully

1014
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:02,079
sometime soon

1015
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,000
and the next one is is there a way we

1016
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,320
can get microsoft to be more responsive

1017
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:10,320
to onedrive takedowns i would love that

1018
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,240
i would also really love

1019
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,720
there to be some kind of

1020
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,680
free

1021
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,880
malware scanning especially for

1022
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:22,000
individual users um

1023
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,760
sorry microsoft but you're really

1024
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,160
terrible

1025
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,440
uh the final question

1026
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,720
online is will urlscan.io

1027
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,240
dom display encoded url content as well

1028
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,280
will it be like encoded will it display

1029
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,079
encoded url slash content

1030
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:42,960
um

1031
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,640
yes so

1032
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,359
sometimes it will be encoded and you'll

1033
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,640
need to do

1034
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,440
the work to decode it

1035
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,480
um it depends how the the browser is

1036
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,160
going to render it so

1037
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,240
if i went back to that page you could

1038
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,480
see that there's all of this you know

1039
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,400
encoded javascript

1040
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,359
stuff

1041
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,200
you know you'd need to take some effort

1042
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,480
to

1043
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,480
decode that but for the most part they

1044
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,119
don't put much effort into

1045
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:13,680
you know encoding things they think it's

1046
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,640
encrypted um because it's you know base

1047
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,400
64 and

1048
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,280
okay but um anyway

1049
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:22,880
sounds familiar i think we're all

1050
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,079
familiar with that

1051
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,440
any questions around the room

1052
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:30,640
i have a question

1053
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,720
do you want to hear a terrible joke

1054
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,690
i do excellent no

1055
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:37,599
[Laughter]

1056
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,280
how did the cyber criminal get away from

1057
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,320
the

1058
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,680
scene of the crime

1059
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,879
how they ran somewhere

1060
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,599
give a warm round of applause for becks

1061
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,320
and no applause for me

1062
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,160
you
