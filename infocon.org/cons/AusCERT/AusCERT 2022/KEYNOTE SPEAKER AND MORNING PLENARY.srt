1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,580
we can make it right

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:05,160
imma need my background to help me sing

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,060
Who

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,160
well good morning ladies and gentlemen

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,759
how are we up and at it on Friday the

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,160
13th there you go of May

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,140
welcome welcome I know for many of you

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,520
it's your first time back on the

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,960
conference scene

10
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,600
for a while maybe even a year or so so

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,460
for many of you also now it's just that

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,080
first time in a while you've felt that

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,359
feeling of the morning after a Gala

14
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,120
dinner of what the hell was I thinking

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,219
last night it's great to see you all

16
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,780
here actually

17
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,760
in some ways pleasantly surprised the

18
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,020
size of the crowd morning after a Gala

19
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,000
dinner but not at all surprised given

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,620
the keynote speaker we've got to kick us

21
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,899
off today we'd also are so excited to

22
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:47,760
have her here this is in fact her first

23
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,899
visit to Australia she's cuddled a koala

24
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,579
she's done it all she's ticked

25
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:54,840
everything off the list and she's here

26
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,039
in her capacity as the Director of

27
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,160
incident response for North America at

28
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,699
the industrial cyber security company

29
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:05,400
dragos Inc leading the response to and

30
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,740
proactively hunting for threats in

31
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,500
customers ICS environments I've always

32
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,820
hoped that dragos was actually

33
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,040
pronounced Drago's

34
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,220
it is dragos oh my apologize and after

35
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:18,900
Ivan Drago

36
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,520
the Russian heavyweight champ from Rocky

37
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,640
IV

38
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,320
oh I was hoping to the dude who killed

39
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,759
Apollo Creed before succumbing to

40
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,200
Sylvester Stallone in a brutal slugfest

41
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,520
anyway

42
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,340
she's not a boxer but when not working

43
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,759
Leslie enjoys being a youth martial arts

44
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,400
in structure so it's a little bit more

45
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,799
Cobra Kai than Rocky IV but it's a start

46
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,020
you may also know her via her iconic

47
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,340
Twitter feed hacks for pancakes she

48
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,840
manages a team of incident response and

49
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,399
digital forensic professionals across

50
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,500
North America and she's here to share

51
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,299
her stories from the field on the topic

52
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:58,439
of uncovering the invisible world of ICS

53
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,299
cyber security how about a massive Round

54
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,860
of Applause for Leslie Carhart

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,199
thank you sir

56
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,760
wow look at all those hungover faces out

57
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,620
there kudos to the five of you I saw at

58
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,260
the gym at 6 30 this morning near tears

59
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,140
so good job everybody it's nice to see

60
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,700
you all thank you for having me here at

61
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,739
Oxford and thank you for having me in

62
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:24,780
your wonderful continent and country

63
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,599
this is also very exciting for me as

64
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:30,000
mentioned I did in fact oh can I have my

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,900
slides

66
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,500
um

67
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,080
I did in fact get to hold a koala and it

68
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,780
was very exciting so um I'm Leslie I

69
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,700
drink and I know things and I'm going to

70
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,319
try to convey some of that knowledge

71
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,780
about useless facts to you all hopefully

72
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,940
useful facts for a few of you

73
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,620
about what I do and I have a really

74
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,180
weird job

75
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,120
um as mentioned I do specifically

76
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,099
incident response for industrial control

77
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:54,720
systems

78
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:57,420
and this is a weird Niche because I'm

79
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,220
one of the few people in the world who

80
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,500
when there is say a cyber security

81
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,280
compromise of a power plant or a train

82
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,739
my team gets called in to do response to

83
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,599
that so these weird non-standard

84
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,700
computer systems but they're really not

85
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,760
that uncommon okay you probably have

86
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,980
industrial control systems in your

87
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,500
environments and I have like 40 minutes

88
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,760
here

89
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,000
to tell you everything I possibly can

90
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,799
about what you should do about that

91
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:27,840
because it's really really important

92
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,540
we're going to talk about what these

93
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,400
systems are where they live what they

94
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,560
look like and how to understand them

95
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,760
we're going to learn some basic

96
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,799
terminology so you can talk to the

97
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:40,019
people who work on those systems

98
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:41,459
next we're going to talk about the

99
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,379
threats they face and why I'm even here

100
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,780
why I even do what I do other than take

101
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,819
glamorous trips to other continents

102
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:49,440
which happens to me all the time

103
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,700
definitely

104
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,799
um not really anyway

105
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,080
and then finally we're going to end with

106
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,180
building your own industrial cyber

107
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,920
security program from the ground up so

108
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,420
if you've got nothing there or you're

109
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,459
just starting I'm going to give you all

110
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:04,379
the tips in a short period of time that

111
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:06,540
I can possibly give you just start

112
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:08,519
building that program it's really really

113
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,099
really important so let's get rolling

114
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:12,239
okay

115
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,760
so ICS fundamentals industrial control

116
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,440
systems

117
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,699
I have a lot of words in some of these

118
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:19,019
slides so you can take out your phone

119
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,339
and you can take a little picture and

120
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,199
take it home with you have some homework

121
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:24,180
you know have a nice picture to post on

122
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,860
Twitter whatever

123
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,780
um this is this is for your reference

124
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,520
but let's let's talk about some terms

125
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,020
I'm going to use in this talk so the

126
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:34,380
first one is operational technology or

127
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,280
OT

128
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,440
now this is a fake made up word

129
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,600
sorry to everybody here who uses that

130
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,919
word frequently in their marketing

131
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,440
material it is a term that we've made up

132
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,720
as I T people to describe stuff that is

133
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,000
the other that wonderful anthropological

134
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,400
concept of the other

135
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,979
um so when we're talking about OT it's

136
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,320
us using it as a differentiator to talk

137
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,600
about this industrial stuff this

138
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,840
non-typical computer stuff that's doing

139
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,300
process things in our environments and

140
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,340
you don't really see like industrial

141
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,979
engineers and operators using those

142
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:09,360
terms so who are these industrial

143
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,060
engineers and operators

144
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,240
um so operators are the people who

145
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,539
kind of make the industrial process run

146
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:20,400
so they watched little screens and they

147
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,780
see how the process is running they make

148
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,880
sure it's safe they adjust levels things

149
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,620
like that they're sitting in the control

150
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,520
center

151
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:29,280
and then we have the more technical

152
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,320
Engineers whether the mechanical

153
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,240
engineers electrical engineers chemical

154
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,759
Engineers who are doing the detailed

155
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,400
management and Analysis of the process

156
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,139
so you have your operators and your

157
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:41,699
engineers who are working on these

158
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:43,740
Industrial Systems but finally let's

159
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,660
talk about what an ICS actually is an

160
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,759
industrial control system

161
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,160
a lot of you are imagining a PLC right

162
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,600
now like a little ruggedized computer

163
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,580
but there have been industrial control

164
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,620
systems for ages and ages and ages and

165
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,360
ages

166
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,460
um they can be gears and pulleys they

167
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,960
can be mechanical

168
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,440
they are simply a a thing that takes

169
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,080
input and makes decisions somehow about

170
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,139
a kinetic process so it could be again

171
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:12,120
gears and pulleys something simple like

172
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,919
that industrial Control Systems have

173
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,919
existed since like early water clocks so

174
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,960
you can do this mechanically you can do

175
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,900
it with analog control so for a long

176
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,740
time industrial control systems were

177
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,600
simple electronic systems that that made

178
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,039
decisions and now they're more

179
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,900
computerized and digital but there's

180
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,759
still plenty of mechanical industrial

181
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,380
Control Systems out there there's still

182
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,300
plenty of analog industrial Control

183
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,880
Systems out there so that's why I'm

184
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,680
going to tell you right now the terms

185
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,080
ICS and scada are not interchangeable we

186
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,240
hear people use them interchangeably all

187
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,979
the time I'll tell you in a little bit

188
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:49,440
what a scada system is

189
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,479
but an industrial control system doesn't

190
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:53,639
necessarily contain scada it can again

191
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,919
be gears you know making something

192
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,319
happen mechanically

193
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,060
but what's this process that I'm talking

194
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:03,120
about or process if I say it properly um

195
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,900
the conflict of world verbiage there

196
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,240
so a process is a series of discrete

197
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,340
things that make something kinetic

198
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,259
happen so it could be all kinds of

199
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:14,520
different stuff right it could be

200
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,340
something as complex as electrical power

201
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,020
generation so you're generating

202
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,479
electricity a kinetic thing or it could

203
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:23,639
be something as simple as a door opening

204
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:26,400
and closing so it's a decision-making

205
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,039
process whether that's gears and pulleys

206
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,039
or a computer system making a physical

207
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:35,400
kinetic thing happening and processes

208
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,960
can have lots of sub processes I mean

209
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,699
think about like canning tuna I always

210
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:40,319
use this example I use it around the

211
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,699
world I've now used it in like three

212
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:43,740
continents so canning tuna you have your

213
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,780
conveyor belt that has you know your

214
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,340
cans you have to fill the cans you have

215
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,139
to put the labels on the cans each one

216
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:50,580
of those things that's a sub process it

217
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,800
makes one big process that is sticking

218
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,960
tuna in cans that have a label on them

219
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,400
and they're sealed and things it's very

220
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,419
exciting

221
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,360
all right

222
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,000
processes are made up of process Loops

223
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,240
okay and a process Loop has three parts

224
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,120
okay everybody it has a sensor a

225
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,460
controller and an actuator

226
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,199
and let's talk about what each one of

227
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:15,840
those things is so first of all you have

228
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,220
to have an actuator that's the thing

229
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,440
that makes the physical thing happen so

230
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,539
that could be making a motor run it

231
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:23,280
could be changing a temperature opening

232
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,039
a valve making a conveyor belt move

233
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,080
etc etc et cetera so something physical

234
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,759
in the world

235
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,219
something has to make decisions about

236
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:33,719
what that's going to do so there's some

237
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:35,640
kind of control device and again that

238
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,500
could be digital which we're mostly

239
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,760
going to talk about in the cyber world

240
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,200
but it could be a mechanical thing as

241
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,019
well that makes decisions about when

242
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:45,240
that actuator does something but it has

243
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,580
to have some input right there has to be

244
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,160
something that helps it know when to do

245
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,440
things so you also have to have some

246
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,240
kind of sensor in your process control

247
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,800
loops

248
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,200
so let's let's look at a pretty simple

249
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,940
familiar example here that I really

250
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,440
really like um we actually don't have

251
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,880
one of these in the hotel I'm very

252
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,680
disappointed I put this in my slides and

253
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,420
this ritzy Hotel doesn't have a

254
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,339
automatic revolving door but raise your

255
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:09,660
hand if you have seen an automatic

256
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,339
revolving door just checking okay

257
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:13,019
everybody's seen an automatic revolving

258
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,480
door has anybody walked into one

259
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,360
a few times I I've walked into an

260
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,399
automatic revolving dark

261
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,680
um so this has the a process control

262
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,540
Loop and it has these three things think

263
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,580
about it for a moment okay so what

264
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,899
happens when you walk into the door it

265
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:29,700
starts turning right so that's the

266
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,860
actuator getting to work but it had to

267
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,300
make a decision about when to start

268
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,980
turning so there's also a sensor right

269
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,779
there's a sensor to tell if you're in

270
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,300
the door and then a controller takes the

271
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,580
input from that sensor and says there's

272
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,500
somebody in the door and I need to start

273
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,560
turning around okay so that's the basics

274
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,820
of the control Loop but there's more

275
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,440
things right because if you get too

276
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,060
close to the door and you impede it

277
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,920
it'll stop right there's a safety

278
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,980
control so that the uh the actuator is

279
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,480
actually providing feedback to the

280
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,040
controller as well and it says I can't

281
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,100
turn stop it's not safe

282
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,740
so there's there's like a bi-directional

283
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,480
feedback going on in that control loop

284
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,440
as well

285
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,540
so there's safety built into these doors

286
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,760
as well and I always use this example um

287
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,100
to understand how these process Loops

288
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,079
can potentially fail so what can go

289
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:19,279
wrong there are only four failure States

290
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,640
for any process Loop okay so the first

291
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,839
one is

292
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:27,300
the actuator fails to start when it's

293
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,800
supposed to so think about your door

294
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,420
what happens then you walk under the

295
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,420
door and it doesn't turn and you're like

296
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,220
I would like to go now

297
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,980
um no so not not too bad in that case in

298
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:40,200
that example fails to stop when it's

299
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,240
supposed to so you walk into the door

300
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,800
and it keeps trying to turn your face

301
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,079
that's rather unpleasant right

302
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,360
the third one is it starts too early or

303
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,620
too late

304
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,959
so you wait for a little while or it

305
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:53,519
keeps turning into your back while

306
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,720
you're getting out of the door very

307
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,060
unpleasant but probably not

308
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,740
life-threatening and finally it goes on

309
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,300
for the wrong period of time which in

310
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,459
that case has similar results

311
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:05,100
every process loop on Earth can have

312
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,140
those four failure States and they can

313
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,880
get much more severe than a revolving

314
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,360
door although Mia culpa there are

315
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,640
apparently a great deal of injuries

316
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,680
caused by revolving doors over time

317
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,260
across the world so they actually can be

318
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,720
dangerous for those reasons in those

319
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,339
failure States

320
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:26,279
but real industrial processes

321
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:28,260
um they are much more complex than a

322
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:31,079
single process Loop usually they have a

323
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:32,880
multitude of different things going on I

324
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,620
talked about canning tuna earlier you

325
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,940
have the conveyor belt going you have

326
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,500
the stuff filling the tuna and

327
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,880
everything has to be synchronized

328
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,380
together because like if it's not then

329
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,660
you have tune on your conveyor belt and

330
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,220
it's disgusting and somebody has to

331
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,459
clean it up like so these process Loops

332
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:48,779
have to work together they have to have

333
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:50,639
feedback between one another so you have

334
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,100
to have some big computer that's making

335
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,959
decisions about all the little computers

336
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,000
and when they do things so they're

337
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,740
coordinating them all and for a long

338
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:00,959
time in the digital world that was

339
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,959
distributed control systems or dcs's

340
00:12:03,959 --> 00:12:06,899
now we're seeing those which are smaller

341
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,480
scale and more elaborate scada systems

342
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,459
to integrate a bunch of parts of a

343
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,980
process together sub processes into a

344
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,079
bigger process and that's where we pull

345
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,420
in scada systems we're talking about

346
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,040
this picture up here which is

347
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,839
controlling a bunch of process Loops

348
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,459
getting feedback from them and

349
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:25,019
coordinating their efforts perhaps over

350
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:27,360
a very large geographic area

351
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,639
so there's your scada

352
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:32,220
process control is super complex there's

353
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,839
a lot of things going on in these

354
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:34,980
processes there's a bunch of

355
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,660
sub-processes with different devices

356
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,060
different sensors different actuators

357
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:41,220
and they have to work together right so

358
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,779
that means a bunch of protocols and

359
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:43,860
things so I'm going to introduce you

360
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,839
here to the Purdue model

361
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,899
this is a model that is educational it's

362
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,820
academic it's not always representative

363
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,560
of everything that's really going on in

364
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,779
industrial control but you can see we

365
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:57,779
have a layer cake here okay so at the

366
00:12:57,779 --> 00:13:00,320
very very bottom we have our very simple

367
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,820
analog digital devices so our things

368
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,160
like our sensors and our actuators

369
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,680
and as we move upward we get into more

370
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,200
familiar devices so at level one you

371
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,940
start to see your PLC see your

372
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,560
ruggedized computers your control

373
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,560
devices simple computers that have you

374
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,360
know simple ladder logic program getting

375
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,440
into them

376
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,300
and at your second level you start to

377
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,100
see things like maybe some familiar

378
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,740
Windows computers like hmis so you might

379
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,019
have a Windows XP XP embedded system

380
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:30,779
there that is your control interface and

381
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,940
that talks to the lower levels but it

382
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,740
might also talk to the upper levels too

383
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:37,139
because as you go up further you start

384
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:39,180
getting to like workstations where the

385
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,160
systems are programmed so actual Windows

386
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,560
workstations or Linux workstations

387
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,380
then you hopefully hopefully have some

388
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:49,079
kind of DMZ which separates you from the

389
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:50,760
rest of your corporate environment your

390
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,620
normal familiar Enterprise environment

391
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,839
so that's the Purdue model so the

392
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:57,660
low-level devices are less familiar the

393
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,519
higher level devices before you reach

394
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,800
the DMZ are

395
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,740
more familiar so potentially Linux

396
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,459
Windows Etc

397
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,240
now why is this important to all of you

398
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,279
well I'm here to tell you that you do

399
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,199
probably have industrial control systems

400
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,480
in your environment they're all over the

401
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,300
place so not just in manufacturing not

402
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,940
just in transportation we do a lot of

403
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:24,420
ICS research on trains and aircraft but

404
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,500
also things like You're Building

405
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,300
Automation and control

406
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,639
we respond to a lot of incidents and

407
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:31,680
data centers around the world where

408
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,779
there's been an intrusion on say the

409
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:36,240
fire suppression system or the heating

410
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,279
and cooling what happens if you're in a

411
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,680
very very hot place and all your air

412
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,420
conditioners suddenly get infected and

413
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,880
fail that has a big impact to how you do

414
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,680
business even if you're only working in

415
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,720
the computer World typically right

416
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,339
so you really need to think about these

417
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,920
control devices and has anybody is

418
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,540
anybody else staying in the hotel with

419
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,220
the little button on the wall that has

420
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,899
the controller for your blinds and

421
00:14:57,899 --> 00:14:59,880
everything so mine crashed while I was

422
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,339
here the electrician had to come up to

423
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:04,740
my room and reset the controller that

424
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,180
makes the light switches work in the

425
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,699
room it took 20 minutes to reset so we

426
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:10,860
are surrounded by industrial control and

427
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,660
Internet of Things devices that control

428
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,060
these process Loops we're surrounded by

429
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,500
them all the time and they do important

430
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,120
things that we often don't notice until

431
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,459
they fail

432
00:15:20,459 --> 00:15:22,500
now there's a concept that I need to

433
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,660
introduce you talk to called itot

434
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,839
convergence an itot convergence means

435
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:30,720
simply it's cheaper to use commercial

436
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,579
off-the-shelf thing to build these

437
00:15:32,579 --> 00:15:35,459
process Loops then go build your own

438
00:15:35,459 --> 00:15:37,980
roll your own it's also safer to

439
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,360
typically use something commercial and

440
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,339
instead of rolling your own protocol or

441
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:42,120
something

442
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,759
so we are in the industrial space seeing

443
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:46,740
more and more familiar Network

444
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,660
infrastructure devices like Cisco and

445
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,959
Juniper and Windows computers doing a

446
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:54,120
lot of these control tasks especially at

447
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,160
the mid levels of the Purdue model but

448
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,620
also at the lower levels because they're

449
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,480
cheaper and easier to replace and

450
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,519
Implement and build so of course people

451
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:03,779
are using more of them they aren't

452
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:05,220
building their own network protocols

453
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,079
like they used to things are running

454
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:10,199
over CAT5 Cat6 between the industrial

455
00:16:10,199 --> 00:16:12,959
devices they're running through typical

456
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,120
switches and routers like we see in our

457
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,040
Enterprise environments and that means

458
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,480
they're vulnerable to all of those

459
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,000
things that those devices are typically

460
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,320
vulnerable to in the cyber security

461
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,399
world

462
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,380
so this has changed a lot of the

463
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,360
vulnerability landscape of industrial

464
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,899
Networks

465
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,519
so I want you to think for a moment I've

466
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,079
told you you probably have an industrial

467
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,600
control device in your environment

468
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,459
think about this this is why you might

469
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:39,839
be missing them if you aren't aware of

470
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,399
them right now they're oftentimes on

471
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,259
different subnets or vlans so like

472
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:44,639
you're building Automation and control

473
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,980
your backup power your heating and

474
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,360
cooling systems your elevator

475
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,480
controllers or even the things that do

476
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,399
your shipping and Logistics like your

477
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:56,040
your RFID tracking systems etc for

478
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,300
shipping

479
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,339
they perform key tasks that are not

480
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:01,019
considered because you're not

481
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,399
necessarily thinking about your

482
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,380
processes you think about cyber security

483
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,900
in a vacuum which is okay in Enterprise

484
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,339
but

485
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:10,020
now we need to think about these

486
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,880
processes right these control loops

487
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,140
these things that are happening to

488
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,760
accomplish our mission

489
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,039
and we oftentimes get the message that

490
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,959
these systems are too sensitive to touch

491
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,000
or look at as cyber security people so

492
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,160
we're told to ignore them we're told to

493
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,599
write them off or check them off in our

494
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:26,220
risk assessments

495
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,959
because there's something that's foreign

496
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,580
and unusual they're low-level devices

497
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,500
and we're scared to break them for good

498
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,700
reason we don't want to bring down our

499
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,500
process and we'll talk about that

500
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,660
and there's oftentimes an unhealthy

501
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,820
culture relationship between the

502
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,220
operators and engineers and I.T and

503
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,780
cyber security because there's been

504
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,700
misunderstandings and miscommunications

505
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,240
for so very very very long

506
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,980
all right so let's talk about why we

507
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,020
care okay so incident response I do

508
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,020
incident response in these systems right

509
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,179
um I respond to three types of cyber

510
00:17:57,179 --> 00:17:59,840
security incidents in ICS typically okay

511
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,960
the first one is Insider threats

512
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,039
now um one of the first industrial cyber

513
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,080
security accidents actually

514
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,120
happened very close to here it was a

515
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,679
sewage plant

516
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,679
um a uh this happened back around 2000 a

517
00:18:16,679 --> 00:18:18,299
fellow working at the plant found out

518
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:19,919
that he didn't get hired on he was a

519
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,840
contractor and he wanted a job there

520
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,580
and he got so mad that he went and he

521
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,100
dumped a bunch of sewage into a nearby

522
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,780
water body

523
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,179
um and it's a horrible mess but this was

524
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:31,860
a great example this was long before

525
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,780
stock snap and anything like that um

526
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:35,280
this is a great example of the the

527
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,460
people who work on these systems 95 of

528
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,679
them are great people 99 of them are not

529
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:43,140
going to do anything bad

530
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,940
um but there's always that one or two

531
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,559
people who are know how to break the

532
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,600
system and they have a bad day or they

533
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,400
get pissed off at their boss and they

534
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,720
decide to break something so that

535
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,580
actually does happen we do respond to

536
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,020
incidents that are Insider threats in

537
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,580
these environments

538
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,900
but they're normally sententional

539
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,940
sometimes the operator who's working at

540
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,260
two in the morning just wants to watch

541
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,080
Netflix like yeah okay

542
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,760
um and they plug something in and they

543
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,200
infect the system

544
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,360
um commodity ransomware can have huge

545
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,919
impacts on those mid levels of the

546
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:12,900
Purdue model if you suddenly can't see

547
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,120
your control screens because they've got

548
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,500
a ransomware screen on them and they're

549
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:18,900
running Windows XP you got to shut down

550
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,880
your process because you can no longer

551
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,740
operate it safely you don't know if it's

552
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:25,559
on fire you have to shut things down so

553
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,419
ransomware can be very impactful same

554
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:29,400
with crypto miners Etc

555
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,840
things that bring down these low

556
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:34,020
resource systems older systems and

557
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,660
finally there's targeted and at dragos

558
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,740
we track a bunch of different

559
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,600
adversaries that are trying their hand

560
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,480
at poking at Industrial Systems and a

561
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,860
lot of what they're doing is foothold

562
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,380
building and reconnaissance so so that's

563
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,419
changing over time you know they're

564
00:19:48,419 --> 00:19:49,980
staging for future attacks they don't

565
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,080
want to waste all these resources and

566
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,480
making something explode right now they

567
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,919
want to build a foothold and they want

568
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,419
to understand the system because they're

569
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:58,980
the processes are complex and they're

570
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,200
hard to break in a specific way so

571
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,400
they're taking their time now and

572
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,220
learning how they work very quietly and

573
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,260
slowly in these environments so that

574
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,059
when they need to in a geopolitical

575
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:13,340
context they can make something explode

576
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,900
all right so I've told you all this I've

577
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,179
told you you've got ICS oh my God and

578
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:19,980
I've told you that you probably need to

579
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,020
do something about it and that there are

580
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,120
people out there who are getting better

581
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,520
and better and better at breaking it for

582
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,140
a multitude of reasons whether it's the

583
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,360
ransomware actors just wanting money or

584
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,460
the advanced adversaries learning about

585
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,740
and staging for future attacks

586
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,539
by the way you are not too small for

587
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:38,220
that to be you they use a lot of small

588
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,140
operators as test beds for their attacks

589
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,640
on bigger stuff

590
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,260
so that's that's not great right so I'm

591
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,460
going to give you a little crash course

592
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,559
in building an industrial cyber security

593
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,480
program for your organization and this

594
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,919
can be little it can be just for your

595
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,840
building Automation and your HVAC

596
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,000
systems if you need to if they could

597
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,919
impact your operations this is an

598
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,659
important thing to do

599
00:20:57,659 --> 00:21:00,000
so I've got my top seven misconceptions

600
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,799
I want to start with this these are my

601
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:03,419
top seven misconceptions I hear from

602
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:04,919
everybody about industrial Control

603
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:06,480
Systems so let's get this out of the way

604
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,960
the first one is that it's an edge case

605
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,460
that it only applies to same

606
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,559
manufacturers or power companies no it's

607
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:14,760
all over the place we already went

608
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:15,780
through that

609
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,240
it has to be out of scope for scans pen

610
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,460
tests and assessments no we just have to

611
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,960
do them differently because these

612
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,900
systems are older Legacy sensitive doing

613
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,880
critical health and safety life life

614
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,559
safety things

615
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,200
it's our Arcane no we looked at the

616
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,120
Purdue model the low-level devices might

617
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,159
be less familiar but the mid-level

618
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:36,960
systems we're talking Windows XP

619
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,880
embedded think Linux things that you are

620
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,320
familiar with there's still Cisco

621
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,200
devices there now Ito OT convergence is

622
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,760
seen to that in a lot of cases you can

623
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,260
learn this stuff

624
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,380
it's protected by air gapping data

625
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,900
diodes and segmentation air gapping is a

626
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,840
lie um I see one to two networks in my

627
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,960
fully ICS career that are actually air

628
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,960
gapped in a year

629
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,460
a lot of organizations will say they're

630
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,960
air gapped and I'll actually go in there

631
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,940
and take a peek and there's like modems

632
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,340
connected to them and there is a DMZ and

633
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,799
there's pass-through in the DMZ

634
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,780
um people have Odd Ideas about what air

635
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,400
gapping actually means and even the

636
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,320
environments where they are air-gapped

637
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,419
they have to do updates right they have

638
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:20,039
to do software programming so somebody

639
00:22:20,039 --> 00:22:22,340
comes in and plugs in a transient laptop

640
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:25,320
and they they bridge to the network or

641
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,539
they they bring in a USB drive something

642
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:29,220
has to bridge even if it's sneakernet

643
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,500
even it has it has to be a human being

644
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,840
walking in with a USB drive so air

645
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,820
gapping is not

646
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,039
common and it's not necessarily a

647
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:40,080
reliable defense I don't see a lot of

648
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,000
data diodes they're a nice idea but

649
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,880
they're expensive

650
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,559
so really we have to think about other

651
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,720
more traditional defense in depth in

652
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,539
this in terms of cyber security

653
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:53,760
um purposefully neglected it is not

654
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,220
purposeful neglected these systems are

655
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,260
Legacy for a reason because the life

656
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,120
cycles are different in industrial

657
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,400
control when you go out and you buy the

658
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,960
equipment for a power plant you are

659
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,360
buying that whole setup that whole

660
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,640
system and support contracts for 20

661
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,100
years maybe and you're buying a really

662
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,980
big expensive package and you can't just

663
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,600
tamper with that it all works together

664
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,700
all those bits all those process Loops

665
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,620
all those parts of the Purdue model they

666
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,940
all work together all those different

667
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,220
protocols that are used at various

668
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,620
levels of the Purdue model they all have

669
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,299
to function together and if you start

670
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:30,000
replacing operating systems or adding

671
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,100
EDR or something you're going to make

672
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,020
something fail you have to work with the

673
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,700
vendor and the engineers on that and it

674
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,039
can take a very long time you might only

675
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:39,840
have a maintenance window in these

676
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,320
environments once or twice a year

677
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,720
um is it easy to secure with next-gen no

678
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,480
we can't install EDR on our XP embedded

679
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,640
hm hmis I'm sorry we've got to go back

680
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,039
in our time machine to 2002 and we've

681
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,600
got to do good security and depth and

682
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,919
we've got to adapt to the fact that

683
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:57,299
we're dealing with a lot of Legacy

684
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:59,460
systems and a lot of very sensitive

685
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,940
systems that we can't tack things onto

686
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,500
um and that it's vulnerable simply

687
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,299
because individual devices are insecure

688
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:08,340
these protocols and devices are made to

689
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,020
be simple so that when you hit the giant

690
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,700
red button on the wall to stop somebody

691
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,919
from being chewed up by a machine the

692
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,600
connection happens really fast and the

693
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,640
machine shuts down if you add encryption

694
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:19,140
to that an overhead to that protocol

695
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:20,880
that could be another precious couple

696
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,400
seconds perhaps or something could fail

697
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,620
you need these protocols to work

698
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:29,700
reliably reliability is number one in

699
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,380
these environments so that these systems

700
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,419
can function safely

701
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:35,940
so real talk here are some real facts

702
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,559
about industrial control systems for you

703
00:24:37,559 --> 00:24:39,720
so the first one is I already mentioned

704
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,640
industrial cyber attacks are increasing

705
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,919
I have more incidents every year it's

706
00:24:43,919 --> 00:24:45,480
really happening and adversaries are

707
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,760
getting better at attacking them

708
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,440
as I mentioned these industrial Control

709
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,659
Systems they often use Legacy stuff on

710
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:54,360
purpose longer life spans that's how

711
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,220
they work they have to function they

712
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,840
have to function reliably without a

713
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,159
bunch of downtime

714
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:01,740
familiarity stuff as we mentioned itot

715
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,900
convergence is happening you will see

716
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,659
more I.T stuff in these environments as

717
00:25:06,659 --> 00:25:08,700
time goes on it's happening more and

718
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,940
more and that means I.T vulnerabilities

719
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,460
air gaping is a lie I'm sorry it sounds

720
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,600
really great if you hear that word

721
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,120
double check everything don't don't take

722
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,640
that term at face value anywhere

723
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,159
protocols rarely have authentication or

724
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:24,900
encryption as I mentioned when you hit

725
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,000
that giant red emergency button on the

726
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,400
wall the system needs to stop

727
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,620
these Protocols are simple for a reason

728
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,360
they are unencrypted for a reason

729
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,059
because the number one thing here in the

730
00:25:36,059 --> 00:25:39,779
CIA Triad is that the the unity you need

731
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:42,419
to have reliable protocol going to the

732
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:43,860
devices so that they do what they're

733
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,799
supposed to do at the right time

734
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,900
um ICS can be sensitive to scanning and

735
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,240
exploitation absolutely these are simple

736
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,120
devices with simple protocol stacks but

737
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,100
there are still ways to do cyber

738
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:58,020
security whether it's testing the

739
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,640
systems during their maintenance windows

740
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,059
or using a sometimes we have a digital

741
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:04,679
twin system where somebody has a little

742
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:07,140
lab where they test the systems maybe we

743
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,179
can do some testing in there there are

744
00:26:09,179 --> 00:26:10,860
ways to work around this but we have to

745
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,140
be adaptable and communicative

746
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,179
and ICS is comprehensible this is

747
00:26:15,179 --> 00:26:17,220
something you can learn you just have to

748
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,260
focus on an area and you have to

749
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:20,760
understand the process that you're

750
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,919
dealing with so the very beginning of

751
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:25,500
this is identify what processes you have

752
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,080
to secure what process environments are

753
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:30,539
in your purview as a cyber security

754
00:26:30,539 --> 00:26:32,460
Personnel even if it's just something

755
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:34,380
like building automation

756
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,299
and you need to have healthy

757
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:39,059
conversations healthy conversations with

758
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:41,820
your engineers and your operators these

759
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,559
people might not trust you at all you're

760
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,000
the people who let don't let them go to

761
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,500
websites you're the people who say they

762
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,179
can't watch Netflix when they're bored

763
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:49,679
at 2 A.M

764
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,080
um so I do suggest pastries that's a

765
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,940
really good really good tactic bring in

766
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,220
a box of something and sit down and say

767
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,159
teach me about your process they are

768
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,919
much more educated and informed about

769
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,080
their process than you will ever be so

770
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,659
let them educate you learn about the

771
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:08,760
processes you have to secure learn about

772
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:10,320
how they're maintained what their

773
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,299
concerns are they already do business

774
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:14,460
continuity planning they know what

775
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,260
they're concerned about they know what

776
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,360
could go horribly wrong you should be

777
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,520
asking these people these questions and

778
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,580
listening and being humble

779
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,860
so we have the cyber security maturity

780
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,740
model here so the basics are the thing

781
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,000
you have to get out of the way out of

782
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,620
the way in any cyber security you need

783
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,000
to start at the very beginning you need

784
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,320
to start with

785
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,360
understanding your environment and the

786
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,919
architecture and what you actually have

787
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,500
to secure so what are we even securing

788
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,000
and how are we going to find it in our

789
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,080
Network so let's talk about

790
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,179
architectural understanding of these

791
00:27:45,179 --> 00:27:46,380
environments this is where you should

792
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,480
start after you understand the processes

793
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,840
that exist okay what's the what's the

794
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,919
process

795
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:55,799
and who's involved in it

796
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,899
what are they concerned about what is

797
00:27:57,899 --> 00:27:59,340
their worst day ever do they have

798
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,559
business continuity planning

799
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:05,100
what vendors are in place and what types

800
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,720
of cyber security tools are already

801
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,039
deployed there might be some simple

802
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:09,960
antivirus there might be some logging

803
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,820
that could be useful to you so again

804
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,440
you've got to listen and have those

805
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,020
conversations with your engineers with

806
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:19,260
the OT staff they knows these things and

807
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,480
if you don't push them and try to push

808
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,700
modern cyber security onto them in an

809
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:26,340
inflexible way they will be willing to

810
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,460
educate you on what's there

811
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,580
asset inventories this is tough in I.T

812
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,340
it's really tough in OT a lot of you

813
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:37,320
probably have some idea where your

814
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,820
systems are and what they're named in

815
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,740
your it environments but these different

816
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,980
vlans and subnets and segments that your

817
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,980
um that your Industrial Equipment live

818
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,399
on are probably unknown or barely known

819
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,500
to you and this means that you have to

820
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,120
start from scratch with this whole asset

821
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,460
inventory process so you're going to

822
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,860
need to find ways that work with your

823
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,659
sensitive industrial environments to get

824
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:03,000
acid inventories there are tools out

825
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,679
there typically they do this passively

826
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:06,659
so they collect Network traffic office

827
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:09,600
fan port or a tap and they build an

828
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,580
asset inventory you can install agents

829
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:13,080
on everything you can't go out there and

830
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,179
do active scanning on everything

831
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:16,860
the best tactic is to do things

832
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,320
passively and carefully and again work

833
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,659
with your operators and engineers

834
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,640
you need Network Maps

835
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,039
you need up to date and routinely

836
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:28,799
updated Network Maps again these are not

837
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,720
the same as your it Network Maps they're

838
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,279
going to involve every level of the

839
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:33,360
Purdue model

840
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,760
and you need to understand from a

841
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,919
process perspective how the network is

842
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,380
laid out and what's sensitive so that

843
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,820
means again you've got to work with

844
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:44,399
those operators and Engineers to start

845
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,020
understanding the layout of your

846
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,940
environment

847
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:50,460
now we need to understand what actually

848
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,779
Matters from a cyber security

849
00:29:51,779 --> 00:29:54,059
perspective so we need to do some Crown

850
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,399
Jewel analysis and really this is

851
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,200
something we should be doing in it but

852
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,360
we're really bad at it

853
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,620
OT people are really good at the

854
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,720
thinking about their worst day ever they

855
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,880
do that from a safety perspective all

856
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,440
the time it's part of business

857
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,679
continuity planning thinking about hey

858
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:13,200
from a very high level what does my

859
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,240
worst day look like is it somebody dying

860
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:18,000
is it the facility catching on fire is

861
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,919
it my multi-million dollar piece of

862
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,840
equipment grinding to a halt and

863
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,580
destroying itself

864
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:26,039
they already have an idea of what those

865
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:27,779
consequences are and what you're going

866
00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:29,399
to need to do is start at the top with

867
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:31,559
the mission and those consequences of

868
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:34,500
concern and understand mapping down

869
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,940
where

870
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,880
what parts of the process what devices

871
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,340
what sub processes could cause these

872
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,320
consequences to happen

873
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,299
this is actually kind of a tricky thing

874
00:30:45,299 --> 00:30:47,039
and a long-term thing that you need to

875
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,799
do and we should do this in it too but

876
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:52,080
it's very very critical life and safety

877
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,000
to do it in OT

878
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,039
so as I mentioned we start at the top

879
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:58,200
what is the worst day ever

880
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,419
and then what parts of the process could

881
00:31:00,419 --> 00:31:02,220
cause that worst day ever

882
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:04,500
are there mitigations in place that

883
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,299
could prevent those terrible things from

884
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,220
happening are there human safety

885
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,140
controls physical safety controls that

886
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,580
prevent things from exploding or

887
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,080
catching on fire

888
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,539
how reliable are those what could cause

889
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:18,360
those to fail and we map downwards and

890
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,820
downwards and downwards until we have a

891
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,919
really good list of very specific things

892
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:25,080
like software things or Hardware things

893
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,299
that could cause those terrible

894
00:31:27,299 --> 00:31:28,980
consequences to happen those are the

895
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:30,720
things we actually care about do we care

896
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,700
if configures on every Windows computer

897
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,820
system I don't know we might not care if

898
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:37,320
every computer in our industrial

899
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,779
environment has configure on it because

900
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:41,760
it does not cause a consequence of

901
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,980
concern this is a different way of

902
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,600
thinking for cyber security people we

903
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,039
care about exploits we care about

904
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,539
malware we care about there's being

905
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:51,419
infections on stuff you have one day of

906
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:53,580
downtime in these networks a year

907
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:55,260
you're probably not going to shut down

908
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,240
your entire process at millions and

909
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,100
millions of dollars

910
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,559
just to go remove configure from some

911
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:03,720
engineering workstations they're working

912
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,000
okay you can make a risk assessment and

913
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,679
say it's probably not going to get worse

914
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,600
it's a headless worm now

915
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,120
and keep things running you need to make

916
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:14,760
those types of risk decisions about the

917
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,679
consequences that you actually care

918
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:18,360
about in your industrial environment

919
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,580
this will help you prioritize what you

920
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,440
do in incident response it'll help you

921
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,720
run threat hunts

922
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,820
um so this Crown Jewel analysis is a

923
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,860
really critical thing to do early on and

924
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,200
it's a heavy lift but it'll really help

925
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,580
you understand what could go

926
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,640
catastrophically wrong and why

927
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,200
so we move on from architectural

928
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,720
understanding to build passive and

929
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:42,240
active defense for our OT environments

930
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,240
so let's move on a little bit immaturity

931
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,559
so now we have five recommendations from

932
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:52,140
our last year in year in review report

933
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,360
at dragos and I agree with them all so

934
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:56,700
I'm just going to read them to you

935
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,039
um so the first one is Build defensible

936
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,419
architecture so we've kind of talked

937
00:33:00,419 --> 00:33:01,919
about that already we want to make sure

938
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,600
that we have things properly segmented

939
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,940
we understand our environment

940
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,940
etc etc so properly segment properly

941
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,860
control access from one part to another

942
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:13,080
as best we can inside our industrial

943
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,279
environment

944
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:16,260
we also want to start implementing

945
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,419
network monitoring so

946
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:20,159
a lot of these environments have no

947
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,080
monitoring in place already but that's

948
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,179
okay we can start building some passive

949
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:26,220
monitoring we that's not an intrusive

950
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:27,779
thing we can start building some

951
00:33:27,779 --> 00:33:30,120
monitoring off a span board or a tap and

952
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,000
understanding our asset inventory

953
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,200
understanding threat detection things

954
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,519
like that

955
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:38,880
establish remote access Authentication

956
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,460
these are a squishy Center okay so we

957
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,720
talked about the Purdue model and

958
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,519
hopefully you've got some kind of DMZ

959
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:46,919
between your internet facing Enterprise

960
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:49,440
environment and your industrial

961
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,200
environment hopefully you have some kind

962
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,000
of DMC between the two and it's

963
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,279
relatively secure and this means having

964
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:58,519
something like jump hosts and

965
00:33:58,519 --> 00:34:00,779
multi-factor authentication to get

966
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:02,880
across that DMZ into the industrial

967
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,620
environment because I mentioned these

968
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,419
Protocols are insecure these devices are

969
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,399
insecure once you get into the

970
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,679
industrial environment segment things

971
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,780
are kind of squishy in the center you

972
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,820
have the hard candy outside and the

973
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:17,159
squishy middle you don't want people

974
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,379
getting in there if you can prevent it

975
00:34:19,379 --> 00:34:21,480
vulnerability management again you're

976
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,800
going to need a separate vulnerability

977
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,020
Management program for your industrial

978
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:27,780
devices because the needs are so much

979
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,940
different when you can shut things down

980
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,859
when they can actually be updated and

981
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:33,480
what that means for your security

982
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,859
posture

983
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:36,480
and finally creating an incident

984
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,760
response plan for your OT environment

985
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,859
what are you going to do if something

986
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:43,440
goes catastrophically wrong there what

987
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,820
do you do if you detect something

988
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,800
malicious or there's a potential Cyber

989
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,239
attack

990
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,579
I'm an into the responder I come into a

991
00:34:50,579 --> 00:34:52,020
lot of incidents where this plan hasn't

992
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,760
been made and what I do for the first

993
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,180
day of incident response is figure all

994
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,500
this stuff out because nobody's ever

995
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,839
done it it slows down into the response

996
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,359
in a crisis it costs more it's much more

997
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,339
expensive to have me do that than you do

998
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:06,900
it right now

999
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,000
so here's some basic questions your

1000
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,740
incident response plan at OT should

1001
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,060
answer

1002
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,280
when's an OT incident declare it so what

1003
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,780
are your declaration thresholds they

1004
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,280
should be related to those consequences

1005
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,780
we talked about

1006
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,540
who will do what when how do you involve

1007
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:24,420
both your cyber security people and your

1008
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,160
OT people they both have to be part of

1009
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,780
this response effort

1010
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,760
how will they contact one another have

1011
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,339
you established that in advance out of

1012
00:35:32,339 --> 00:35:34,880
band Communications document sharing

1013
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,440
resource sharing Etc how are you going

1014
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,780
to do that and how are you going to call

1015
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,880
one another in a call tree Etc if

1016
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,740
something goes wrong I see some people

1017
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,060
like laughing at each other right there

1018
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:47,220
obviously this is gone catastrophically

1019
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,020
wrong for you I've seen it go

1020
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:50,579
catastrophically wrong a ton of

1021
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:51,960
different times

1022
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,300
how do you even do OT forensics we're

1023
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,640
talking about plcs and things what are

1024
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,599
you going to do if you have a

1025
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,700
potentially compromised PLC and you need

1026
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,020
to know if the firmware has been

1027
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,280
tampered with

1028
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,260
who are you going to call is it a cert

1029
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,760
is it a vendor do you have somebody

1030
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,160
internally you can work with that

1031
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:10,200
it's a different world of forensics do

1032
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,700
you have forensic stuff that can do

1033
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,280
forensics on Windows NT if that exists

1034
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,440
in your OT environment you need to work

1035
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,780
this stuff out in advance

1036
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,060
where's the big red button or X how are

1037
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,099
you going to cut things off in an

1038
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:24,839
emergency so what how are you going to

1039
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:26,700
hit the big red button or chop off

1040
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,160
Network segmentation if say ransomware

1041
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,599
is spreading through your ICS

1042
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:32,400
environment that's a really tough

1043
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,800
question and safety concerns and

1044
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,420
requirements you're talking about

1045
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,400
hazardous environments do you need PPE

1046
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,320
do you need to be wearing a hard hat do

1047
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,940
you have that can you buy one quickly

1048
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:44,339
there's a bunch of different concerns

1049
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:46,320
that go into OT incident response

1050
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,940
planning

1051
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,740
collection management this is really

1052
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,960
really important as well you need to

1053
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,119
know what data you have available to do

1054
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:55,980
analysis and monitoring and incident

1055
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:58,200
response in your OT environment

1056
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,480
how long is it retained you might know

1057
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,619
this well for your Enterprise

1058
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:03,240
environment but again we're talking

1059
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,160
about an entirely different environment

1060
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,160
with entirely different concerns so you

1061
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,660
really need to you don't necessarily

1062
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,880
have a Splunk index list that you can

1063
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,560
use you need to build an Excel

1064
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,420
spreadsheet of what data sources are

1065
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:19,200
available in your ICS environment

1066
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,480
and finally let's talk about moving on

1067
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,240
into the Future Okay so as you're

1068
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:27,000
talking about moving on to higher levels

1069
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,280
of maturity an important thing that I

1070
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,079
can tell you is find out how mature you

1071
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:33,240
really are right now not based on your

1072
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,640
own negative or positive biases

1073
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,099
so you really need to rate your maturity

1074
00:37:38,099 --> 00:37:40,079
in your industrial control Network in

1075
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,579
terms of cyber security and understand

1076
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:43,619
where you stand compared to everyone

1077
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:45,780
else that's going to tell you whether

1078
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,520
you should move to more advanced things

1079
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,980
like threat Intel Etc

1080
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:52,020
so a tool I will suggest to you that you

1081
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:53,280
can take home today and do something

1082
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,700
with is the US Department of Energy's

1083
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:59,099
c2m2 bottle it's a self-survey that

1084
00:37:59,099 --> 00:38:00,960
rates you in three levels of maturity

1085
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,640
from one two and three level one is just

1086
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,380
basic fundamental maturity the things

1087
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,480
we've been talking about today moving

1088
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,160
into maturity level three where you're a

1089
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,660
little bit more advanced and maturity

1090
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,339
level three is the most sophisticated

1091
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:17,579
modern cyber security programs with the

1092
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:20,460
correct Staffing and everything complete

1093
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,200
um and what you're going to do is rate

1094
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,180
yourself across a number of categories

1095
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:27,119
in cyber security and then you'll take a

1096
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,740
look at these graphs and it'll show you

1097
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,540
whether you've completed all of maturity

1098
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,339
level one and you don't want to move to

1099
00:38:32,339 --> 00:38:34,140
maturity level two until you've

1100
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:36,000
completed all the things at maturity

1101
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:37,320
level one

1102
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,300
this takes a couple days to do the whole

1103
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,099
thing sit in a room with your operators

1104
00:38:41,099 --> 00:38:43,560
your engineers your network people go

1105
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,079
through all the questions be honest this

1106
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,700
will help eliminate that bias about

1107
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,079
where you really stand and where you

1108
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:51,060
should go next because again if you see

1109
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,380
that you're jumping ahead to the

1110
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,880
maturity level three stuff and you

1111
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,320
haven't done the maturity level one

1112
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,220
stuff

1113
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,380
you need to start with the fundamentals

1114
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,900
in your uh in your ICS cyber security

1115
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,980
program this is a really important tool

1116
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:07,680
now if this is all too much for you I

1117
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,240
understand

1118
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,099
I understand I've thrown a lot at you

1119
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,540
right now we've gone through the entire

1120
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,160
world this is normally a five-day class

1121
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,900
at Sans and I've dumped it all on you in

1122
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:16,980
40 minutes

1123
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,260
start with the basics anything that you

1124
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,000
can do here matters at least understand

1125
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,980
what you need to secure start with the

1126
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:25,200
fundamentals try doing a tabletop

1127
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,180
exercise that involves your processes

1128
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,640
and your industrial control devices

1129
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,859
humble when you're relating to your

1130
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:34,079
operators and Engineers those bad

1131
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,820
relationships are probably there and you

1132
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,079
need to start from scratch bring your

1133
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:38,520
pastries

1134
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,800
be humble ask them questions learn about

1135
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,300
your process it's probably really

1136
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,579
interesting and they want to help they

1137
00:39:44,579 --> 00:39:45,900
want to educate everybody wants to talk

1138
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,700
about their job right

1139
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,280
project ties the longer term things if

1140
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,780
it's really hard to start building out

1141
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,400
passive monitoring in your industrial

1142
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,800
Network take your time build a project

1143
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:56,940
around it

1144
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,220
start with the fundamentals first but

1145
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,020
anything that you can do today will save

1146
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,880
you time and money if you have to call

1147
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,160
in a person like me I want to save you

1148
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,560
money I'm a terrible salesperson

1149
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,119
yes you should have a plan for instant

1150
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:11,220
responses in your ICS environment that's

1151
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,200
a must-have but it's very very important

1152
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,839
to have as much prepared in advance as

1153
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:18,000
you can because you don't want to pay me

1154
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,859
at incident response rates to do that

1155
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:21,900
for you at the beginning of an incident

1156
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:24,060
and leverage outside resources when

1157
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:27,000
needed we're here but all of our major

1158
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,420
competitors in the ICS cyber security

1159
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:31,619
landscape are also in the vendor hall

1160
00:40:31,619 --> 00:40:32,700
right now

1161
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,859
I am a terrible salesperson I don't care

1162
00:40:34,859 --> 00:40:37,380
who you find to help you do this find

1163
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,480
somebody to help you do this

1164
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,400
it's very very critical from a health

1165
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,040
and safety and cost-saving perspective

1166
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,380
to secure your industrial environments

1167
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:48,900
whatever those might be go out and find

1168
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:51,000
help and begin to do this today it's

1169
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,619
really really important

1170
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:55,079
thank you everybody for having me I'm so

1171

grateful to be here

1172
00:40:56,430 --> 00:41:02,280
[Applause]

1173
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,619
Leslie that was wonderful we're so

1174
00:41:04,619 --> 00:41:05,760
excited to have you here we're slightly

1175
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,839
there but I want to ask a couple of

1176
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,480
quick questions naive idiot outside of

1177
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,760
all of this but I assume as we move into

1178
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,060
this genuine world of Internet of things

1179
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,140
and

1180
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,240
hundreds of millions or billions of more

1181
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,740
devices all start getting connected this

1182
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:22,140
area only grows in importance and

1183
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,520
complexity is that right are we just at

1184
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,099
the beginning of this sort of taking off

1185
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:29,099
the um ICS world has been a Harbinger

1186
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:32,099
for what's happened in smart devices and

1187
00:41:32,099 --> 00:41:33,660
iot

1188
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,420
um everything that is new and horrible

1189
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:39,119
about smart and iot has happened before

1190
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:41,579
in ICS so the connecting everything to

1191
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:43,079
the internet and the devices without

1192
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:45,720
security built in and things becoming

1193
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,480
more and more commercial

1194
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:50,579
all of that happened already in ICS and

1195
00:41:50,579 --> 00:41:52,440
yes it's only continuing to get worse

1196
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,680
with iiot and iot so this problem is not

1197
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:57,540
going away it's only increasing and

1198
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,980
you're going to see more and more of

1199
00:41:58,980 --> 00:41:59,819
these

1200
00:41:59,819 --> 00:42:01,920
digital devices that are connected to

1201
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:03,180
the internet connected to Bluetooth

1202
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:05,400
connected to one another out there in

1203
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,900
your environments fantastic lift this

1204
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:07,920
lid up because I want this in the photo

1205
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,300
I'm getting the guy to type oh oh

1206
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:14,400
final question if you talk to a hundred

1207
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,099
organizations about this you've got 100

1208
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:18,980
organizations in the room first question

1209
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:22,140
how many of those hundred are anywhere

1210
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:25,140
near across this issue enough for your

1211
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:27,660
liking on average in business

1212
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:28,260
um

1213
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,359
you know we did a survey of how many

1214
00:42:30,359 --> 00:42:31,859
people have incident response plans in

1215
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:33,839
general and that number through the

1216
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,880
whole company both it and OT and that

1217
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,380
number was relatively low it was

1218
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:40,260
certainly not 80 percent and then when

1219
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:42,900
you look at people who have specifically

1220
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,760
OT incident response plans and some kind

1221
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,619
of security program around OT it's even

1222
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:49,619
even lower so I had an opportunity today

1223
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:51,960
to reach out to all of you and try to

1224
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,060
convince a few more percent to start

1225
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,099
building this program it's really

1226
00:42:56,099 --> 00:42:57,839
important I get called out for some

1227
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,339
really catastrophic things you'll never

1228
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:01,920
see in the news Okay so busy people lots

1229
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,300
of things I know there's all these

1230
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:04,560
things they should get to if this is

1231
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,859
reaching out to them what's the single

1232
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:10,760
idiot simple takeaway thing they can do

1233
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:15,420
right now to significantly bolster their

1234
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:16,680
strength in this area of all the things

1235
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,240
you talked about go to the bakery pick

1236
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:20,220
up a box of pastries take that take it

1237
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,260
into your process environment watch the

1238
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,119
safety concern signs so you don't go in

1239
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:26,339
there and look like an idiot and meet

1240
00:43:26,339 --> 00:43:27,960
your engineers and your operators and

1241
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:30,060
understand what they do start with that

1242
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,160
start with a conversation hi my name is

um my name is Josh Schwartz as mentioned

1285

I'm a senior sales engineer with airlock

1286
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,099
digital we'll come back to those guys at

1287
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:07,800
the end I've got a history in a range of

1288
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,839
different Technologies I've done

1289
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:12,359
everything defensive security but

1290
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:14,579
basically summarized I love preventative

1291
00:45:14,579 --> 00:45:16,440
security controls and that's how I've

1292
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,480
ended up here at airlock digital I'm a

1293
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,160
huge fan of purple taming so come find

1294
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,180
me on the booth if you want to have a

1295
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,859
conversation and yeah as I said

1296
00:45:22,859 --> 00:45:26,299
self-professed blunt fanboy

1297
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,040
so

1298
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,180
I don't want to sound like a broken

1299
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:31,500
record but I really just want to make

1300
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,540
sure we're all on the same page here so

1301
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:34,260
I'm going to be talking about the

1302
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,940
essential eight today

1303
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:37,740
um I'm sure everyone's heard it you've

1304
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:39,540
heard it a million times it's been you

1305
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:42,240
know smashed into your brains but just

1306
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,220
in case you haven't come across it this

1307
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:45,839
is a list of eight controls that the

1308
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:47,280
Australian cyber security centers put

1309
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,020
together

1310
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:49,920
they put them together because they

1311
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,420
actually work you know these guys are

1312
00:45:51,420 --> 00:45:52,500
the ones out there doing instant

1313
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,839
response every day and so these are the

1314
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:56,040
eight controls that if you've got them

1315
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,980
all in place massively reduce the risk

1316
00:45:57,980 --> 00:46:00,599
of cyber security attacks against your

1317
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:03,060
organization

1318
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,380
um so hopefully you're doing a lot of

1319
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:05,940
these already you know some stuff's

1320
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:06,839
really simple

1321
00:46:06,839 --> 00:46:08,700
um patching machines turn on two Factor

1322
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,800
some of them have a reputation for being

1323
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,359
a little bit harder

1324
00:46:12,359 --> 00:46:13,800
um I want to challenge that and we'll

1325
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,780
get to that but the reason we always

1326
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,040
bang on about it is because it actually

1327
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,920
works so if you look in the top left

1328
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,359
hand corner there you'll see number one

1329
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:25,040
on the list is application control

1330
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:28,260
so let's talk about app control what

1331
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,400
actually is it and what are we trying to

1332
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:32,280
achieve here so application control is

1333
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,800
the act of explicitly stating what is

1334
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,119
and is not allowed to run on the

1335
00:46:36,119 --> 00:46:37,319
endpoint and making sure we actually

1336
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:39,240
enforce that so we did a final list of

1337
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,280
what's trusted in our environment and

1338
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,500
then we run that and interestingly it

1339
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:46,079
blocks by default so unlike antivirus or

1340
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,780
EDR which blocks no and bad application

1341
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,420
control only allows non-good so it

1342
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,099
massive reduces our attack surface in

1343
00:46:53,099 --> 00:46:55,099
our organization and it can even cover

1344
00:46:55,099 --> 00:46:57,839
attacks such as you know low bins or

1345
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,760
living off the land binaries and we can

1346
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,339
again lock those down and really control

1347
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:04,859
those in a way that you know Solutions

1348
00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:08,540
like EDR and Antivirus can't do

1349
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,680
so there's this perception that this is

1350
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:16,280
hard to implement I've heard a range of

1351
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,200
reasons speculation there's always

1352
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:20,700
horror stories flying around you know

1353
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:22,740
they deployed it and it it broke

1354
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,960
something or users got mad

1355
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,460
um you know I've heard all sorts so you

1356
00:47:26,460 --> 00:47:27,839
know cyber security team doesn't have

1357
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:29,099
capacity

1358
00:47:29,099 --> 00:47:30,780
um service desk is going to get swamped

1359
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:32,880
by tickets and we can't do it I don't

1360
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:34,319
know what to trust you know these are

1361
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,780
all really common conversations

1362
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:37,619
um

1363
00:47:37,619 --> 00:47:39,900
but I want to challenge these today

1364
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:40,980
um you know

1365
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,200
um we've rolled this out in millions of

1366
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:45,180
not Millions thousands of customers

1367
00:47:45,180 --> 00:47:46,800
right and and there's people doing this

1368
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,000
every day

1369
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,059
um so it's definitely achievable

1370
00:47:51,059 --> 00:47:53,040
so the trick here is we need to plan to

1371
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,020
be successful

1372
00:47:55,020 --> 00:47:56,940
so a lot of people fail because they

1373
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:58,380
just grab a tool off the shelf for one

1374
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:59,579
that they've already got or they buy the

1375
00:47:59,579 --> 00:48:00,960
add-on for a solution they already have

1376
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,059
and they just start enforcing and they

1377
00:48:03,059 --> 00:48:04,619
just start trusting

1378
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:05,940
um and making exemptions and making

1379
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:08,579
rules and this often leads to you know a

1380
00:48:08,579 --> 00:48:09,780
bad outcome and these horror stories

1381
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:10,859
that we've heard

1382
00:48:10,859 --> 00:48:12,359
so it's really important that we start

1383
00:48:12,359 --> 00:48:14,040
with the why you know we need to

1384
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,059
understand what are we actually trying

1385
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:16,800
to achieve and just saying we're trying

1386
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:18,900
to achieve essentially maturity is not a

1387
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,700
good enough answer we need to understand

1388
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,559
are we trying to control executables you

1389
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:23,760
know we just want to stop that phishing

1390
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:25,200
attack and the user double clicking on a

1391
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,020
binary or are we trying to control

1392
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:30,119
drivers dlls system files Powershell

1393
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:32,099
scripts on the endpoint these are really

1394
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:34,140
important things to consider

1395
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:35,760
you know things like admin users

1396
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,440
excluded do you want to control just for

1397
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,280
the user or do we want to actually

1398
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,480
restrict what the administrator is

1399
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,240
allowed to do on those same machines

1400
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,880
um so basically it boils down to you

1401
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,559
know are we trying to do anti-malware

1402
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:48,359
protection or are you trying to stop you

1403
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:49,859
know the non-marketing team from running

1404
00:48:49,859 --> 00:48:52,319
Adobe software

1405
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,720
so to help us understand this why or

1406
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:56,160
choose our why

1407
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,839
um the essentially maturity model can be

1408
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:59,339
a really good approach

1409
00:48:59,339 --> 00:49:01,740
um and and help us kind of Target what

1410
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:04,700
our end state looks like

1411
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:07,740
so hopefully everyone's familiar with

1412
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:09,180
the essential 8 material levels but

1413
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,380
basically it's broken down into four

1414
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:12,960
levels so it's all about risk mitigation

1415
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:16,200
and intent so you know we can sit there

1416
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,059
and and you know do a risk analysis of

1417
00:49:18,059 --> 00:49:19,619
your organization you know are you guys

1418
00:49:19,619 --> 00:49:22,079
actively being targeted by apts then

1419
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:23,520
highly recommend you target level three

1420
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,460
are you a small medium business with not

1421
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:29,460
many employees not much I.T not much IP

1422
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:31,140
then maybe level one is more than

1423
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:33,180
appropriate for you

1424
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:35,220
um so if we break these down level zero

1425
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:37,380
is obviously doing nothing level ones

1426
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:39,240
you're proactively blocking executables

1427
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:41,579
so the intent of level one is again

1428
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:43,260
dealing with that drive by type attack

1429
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:45,780
the phishing attack that the user gets

1430
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,880
an email and double clicks on the file

1431
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:49,859
as we Step Up level two we're now

1432
00:49:49,859 --> 00:49:51,960
expanding that to you know the scripts

1433
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,180
the libraries the installers

1434
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,040
and on to level three where we're now

1435
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,440
including bypasses as well those living

1436
00:49:58,440 --> 00:50:00,240
off the land binaries so this is where

1437
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,380
we get into the really complex

1438
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:05,540
complicated uh mature stuff

1439
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,140
um so now we've picked our maturity

1440
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:08,400
level and we understand what we're

1441
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,200
trying to achieve here how do we

1442
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,520
actually kind of start making this

1443
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,619
practical

1444
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:15,000
you've probably heard this a million

1445
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,099
times but it's really important with

1446
00:50:17,099 --> 00:50:18,420
application control to build a

1447
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:20,160
cross-functional team

1448
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:21,900
so one thing that a lot of people seem

1449
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,280
surprised by when I come and have this

1450
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:25,440
conversation with them is that the most

1451
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,059
mature organizations that are doing

1452
00:50:27,059 --> 00:50:28,800
application control the cyber security

1453
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,359
team doesn't actually run the platform

1454
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:32,520
they write some policy and say here's

1455
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,420
what we want to allow in our

1456
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,040
organization but from that point on

1457
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,839
their hands off

1458
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:38,280
um so because of that reason we need to

1459
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:39,720
make sure that when when you're rolling

1460
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,220
this out you've got a cross-functional

1461
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:42,059
team

1462
00:50:42,059 --> 00:50:43,500
um it's got representation from server

1463
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,440
admins desktop admins

1464
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,240
developers support team and of course

1465
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,558
the Cyber and risk team as well

1466
00:50:52,619 --> 00:50:54,480
cool so once we've got the team we need

1467
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,599
to start thinking about our use cases

1468
00:50:57,599 --> 00:50:59,220
so we really need to understand how our

1469
00:50:59,220 --> 00:51:01,440
users work so as Leslie just mentioned

1470
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:02,940
you know it's all about sitting down

1471
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:05,280
with your users and understanding kind

1472
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,020
of you know what are they doing and how

1473
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:08,460
they're doing it

1474
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:09,839
so if we talk about some of the

1475
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,339
traditionally more difficult or

1476
00:51:11,339 --> 00:51:13,740
perceived difficult Solutions you know

1477
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,200
we've got our developers so you know

1478
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,420
these guys are generating code running

1479
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:20,160
weird code compiling they're doing all

1480
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,140
sorts of interesting behaviors so we

1481
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,520
need to sit down with them and ask them

1482
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,380
questions like what tools are they using

1483
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:27,000
what languages are they writing do they

1484
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,440
have a build server do they have a

1485
00:51:28,440 --> 00:51:29,760
pipeline

1486
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,800
um you know so the intent here is that

1487
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,079
we sit down with them and understand how

1488
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:35,700
can we control them and give them a safe

1489
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:37,140
environment but not interrupt their

1490
00:51:37,140 --> 00:51:39,599
day-to-day workflow so you know can can

1491
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,160
they sign their code if they can sign

1492
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:42,480
that code we can do trust the publisher

1493
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,760
and Away you go can we give them a

1494
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:46,680
specified file path you know hey you

1495
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:48,540
guys have your developing development

1496
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,780
tools into C developers and Away you go

1497
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,980
so we can definitely find that middle

1498
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:56,119
ground and keep everyone happy

1499
00:51:57,720 --> 00:51:59,700
remote workers who've seen over the last

1500
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,740
two three years now it feels like a blur

1501
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:04,380
but remote works you know becoming more

1502
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:05,940
popular so we really need to understand

1503
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:07,680
you know what's the intent of the

1504
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,920
control when a user goes home off VPN

1505
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,599
takes their device you know off off site

1506
00:52:12,599 --> 00:52:15,420
somewhere we want to make sure that you

1507
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:17,040
know is this security control meant to

1508
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:19,140
be enforced when they go home uh is it

1509
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:21,119
not what happens if you can't talk back

1510
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,980
to the the server or group policy or

1511
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:25,319
whatever it is so we need to consider

1512
00:52:25,319 --> 00:52:27,599
that and make sure we understand and

1513
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:30,740
what we want to achieve there

1514
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:32,700
another really common one is the

1515
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,859
executives so we know they're always uh

1516
00:52:34,859 --> 00:52:36,960
interesting people and their demands are

1517
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,520
never come through with you know five

1518
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:39,960
days notice

1519
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,119
um so we need to make sure that we're in

1520
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:44,280
a position where the world's not going

1521
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:46,619
to explode if the executive you know is

1522
00:52:46,619 --> 00:52:48,000
five minutes away from a WebEx meeting

1523
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,800
and we've forgotten to trust that in in

1524
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:52,020
our policy so we need to make sure we've

1525
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:56,220
got them considered in our use case

1526
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:59,819
another big one is it so I.T unlike a

1527
00:52:59,819 --> 00:53:01,020
lot of users they're doing quite

1528
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:02,460
interesting things you know you have to

1529
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:04,260
think about what a day in the life of it

1530
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:06,000
looks like not so much what they're

1531
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,260
doing on their machines that's pretty

1532
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:09,359
easy to Define but you know they're

1533
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:11,220
making remote connections so you know we

1534
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:12,599
our security control might say we don't

1535
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:14,819
want users using RDP but now how do we

1536
00:53:14,819 --> 00:53:16,319
make sure that it is able to remotely

1537
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:19,380
access those machines to provide support

1538
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:21,059
so when we have these conversations with

1539
00:53:21,059 --> 00:53:23,400
our users these help us Define and

1540
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,920
understand the test cases so that when

1541
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,020
it comes time to test tools we can jump

1542
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,579
in there and know what we have to test

1543
00:53:29,579 --> 00:53:30,780
to make sure we're not going to upset

1544
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:33,319
our users

1545
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,740
cool so once we've thought about all

1546
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,480
this it's time to get into the boring

1547
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:41,819
stuff the documentation writing ask

1548
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:44,220
yourself lots of why questions so the

1549
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,540
best place to start is asking yourself

1550
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:47,819
about the roles and responsibilities so

1551
00:53:47,819 --> 00:53:49,800
there's a lot to this so you need to

1552
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:51,480
really unpack it so you know you need to

1553
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,040
be asking yourself questions like who's

1554
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,480
going to be responsible for the policy

1555
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,220
who's going to do the day-to-day

1556
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:58,500
administration of the tool you know the

1557
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,660
updates and the maintenance

1558
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:01,859
um who do the tickets get logged to

1559
00:54:01,859 --> 00:54:03,900
what's support going to be responsible

1560
00:54:03,900 --> 00:54:05,940
for what's going to be a ticket to cyber

1561
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:08,819
security risk team so as I mentioned

1562
00:54:08,819 --> 00:54:09,960
before you know it's often not the cyber

1563
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:10,800
security team that's going to be living

1564
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,359
this day to day so make sure you've

1565
00:54:12,359 --> 00:54:13,800
really got clear definitions of who's

1566
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:16,760
responsible for what

1567
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:20,280
this is a huge one so we really need to

1568
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,480
understand the workflow and the

1569
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:23,160
day-to-day of what and how we're going

1570
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:24,300
to trust

1571
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:25,859
so what is going to be the source of

1572
00:54:25,859 --> 00:54:27,960
Truth do you have you know an acceptable

1573
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,059
use policy that says we're only allowed

1574
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:31,440
to run this sort of software in our

1575
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,140
environment does cyber security have a

1576
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:36,059
rule about you know if it pops up as

1577
00:54:36,059 --> 00:54:37,859
malicious in the AV it's not allowed to

1578
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:39,780
run in the environment so we really need

1579
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:41,339
to think about what is the actual

1580
00:54:41,339 --> 00:54:44,099
definition of what we trust

1581
00:54:44,099 --> 00:54:45,960
and from that how do you add and remove

1582
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,559
trust who's going to be able to say that

1583
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:51,180
this program is now trusted to run in

1584
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:52,440
our environment

1585
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:54,059
and who's going to be responsible for

1586
00:54:54,059 --> 00:54:55,260
saying removing

1587
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:57,119
um trust so what happens if you know

1588
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:58,799
there's a supply chain attack and you

1589
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:00,359
need to rip it out you know is that

1590
00:55:00,359 --> 00:55:01,440
something that support's able to do

1591
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,940
because the users

1592
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:04,859
um you know going to complain when that

1593
00:55:04,859 --> 00:55:06,960
stops working so we need to make sure

1594
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:09,780
this is really locked down

1595
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:11,880
another important one to flag here is

1596
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,380
know what external resources you're

1597
00:55:13,380 --> 00:55:14,760
going to consult and make sure this is

1598
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:16,319
documented before you get into the

1599
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:18,359
database operation you don't want to be

1600
00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:20,400
waiting and looking at files and then

1601
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,440
going oh I'll just check virustotal just

1602
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:23,940
have virus total say it's perfectly fine

1603
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:25,500
but it doesn't match your policy you

1604
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:28,880
know make sure it's really codified

1605
00:55:29,339 --> 00:55:30,359
um and if you're struggling to know

1606
00:55:30,359 --> 00:55:32,339
where to start I highly recommend just

1607
00:55:32,339 --> 00:55:33,420
trust everything that's in your

1608
00:55:33,420 --> 00:55:35,579
organization you know most people are

1609
00:55:35,579 --> 00:55:37,619
walking around assuming they're devices

1610
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:38,880
and their environments aren't

1611
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:40,799
compromised so that's a really good

1612
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,480
place to start you can always go broad

1613
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:44,700
trust everything and reduce trust over

1614
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:46,939
time

1615
00:55:50,339 --> 00:55:52,319
cool so exception policy is a huge one

1616
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,940
as well I mentioned the executive users

1617
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:56,220
before so we need to make sure we

1618
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:57,960
understand and pre-plan who's going to

1619
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,059
be eligible for exceptions and who's

1620
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:02,099
going to be able to you know add the

1621
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:04,140
users to the exception group and handle

1622
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,420
them you know again we see a lot of

1623
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:08,280
people that do this successfully will

1624
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:10,619
have their support team able to generate

1625
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:12,240
the exceptions and then we'll have the

1626
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,799
audit gets sent on to the cyber security

1627
00:56:13,799 --> 00:56:16,020
and risk team

1628
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:18,180
so that's a really good approach to take

1629
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:21,180
another interesting point here is what's

1630
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:23,099
an exemption policy versus what's an

1631
00:56:23,099 --> 00:56:24,480
actual policy change you know where's

1632
00:56:24,480 --> 00:56:26,640
the Line in the Sand of you get a pass

1633
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:28,859
to run this once versus this is going to

1634
00:56:28,859 --> 00:56:30,420
be allowed for my whole organization we

1635
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:31,680
need to make sure that's clearly defined

1636
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,480
kind of before we get into actually

1637
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:36,500
deploying the software

1638
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,680
another really really critical piece is

1639
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:42,359
you need to have a mature software

1640
00:56:42,359 --> 00:56:43,619
deployment a software maintenance

1641
00:56:43,619 --> 00:56:45,119
program before you even consider doing

1642
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:47,180
application control

1643
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:50,099
we see in our experience that the people

1644
00:56:50,099 --> 00:56:51,660
that do this successfully have a really

1645
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,700
you know locked down standard you know

1646
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,319
we're deploy using InTune and here's our

1647
00:56:55,319 --> 00:56:57,839
sewing image that makes the world a lot

1648
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:01,079
easier easier place to work in so yeah

1649
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:03,000
the more uniform it is the easier it's

1650
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,099
going to be to roll out and worth noting

1651
00:57:05,099 --> 00:57:06,480
here you know a lot of people seem to

1652
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,339
think that the allow listing or

1653
00:57:08,339 --> 00:57:09,960
application control project is going to

1654
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,180
be difficult because I've got a huge

1655
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:13,920
organization it's actually just going to

1656
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,000
be difficult depending on how many

1657
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,319
different applications and how many

1658
00:57:16,319 --> 00:57:17,579
different use cases you have in your

1659
00:57:17,579 --> 00:57:19,920
organization so you can imagine if you

1660
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,079
everyone in your organization has local

1661
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,420
admin and they've all got Spotify and

1662
00:57:24,420 --> 00:57:26,040
Netflix on their machines this is going

1663
00:57:26,040 --> 00:57:29,540
to be a much harder conversation to have

1664
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,480
um in a similar vein the software

1665
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:40,980
development process so I talked about

1666
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:42,359
talking to your developers as I'm

1667
00:57:42,359 --> 00:57:44,460
understanding how they work but actually

1668
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:46,440
also knowing you know how their

1669
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:48,420
pipelines work how does the new code get

1670
00:57:48,420 --> 00:57:49,859
introduced you know if you've got

1671
00:57:49,859 --> 00:57:51,119
application developers and the apps

1672
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:52,799
getting pushed onto a web server you

1673
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:54,480
know how does that process happen and

1674
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:55,859
how can we inject ourselves into that

1675
00:57:55,859 --> 00:57:57,660
pipeline we need to make sure we really

1676
00:57:57,660 --> 00:57:59,040
understand this because this is going to

1677
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:00,299
be the sort of stuff that really trips

1678
00:58:00,299 --> 00:58:03,619
us up early on

1679
00:58:04,859 --> 00:58:07,680
and annoyingly uh or at least annoying

1680
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,119
for me I'm sure there's some GRC people

1681
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,500
out there that love it but make sure

1682
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,480
this is really documented well you know

1683
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:13,980
make sure it's all codified there's not

1684
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:15,780
going to be any questions once we get

1685
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:17,280
into the rollout phase we know who's

1686
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,119
going to be responsible for everything

1687
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:22,160
what's going to be trusted and so on

1688
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:26,700
cool so now we know where to start

1689
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,680
um a real Pro tip for once you actually

1690
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:30,420
get into the deployment phase is make

1691
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:31,619
sure you're doing your people change

1692
00:58:31,619 --> 00:58:33,240
management

1693
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,079
um we've got to make sure we're working

1694
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:35,720
with our users and not against them

1695
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,500
especially if you're going to come along

1696
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,180
and start telling them they're not

1697
00:58:39,180 --> 00:58:41,819
allowed to do something so again make

1698
00:58:41,819 --> 00:58:43,799
sure you've got a plan to work with

1699
00:58:43,799 --> 00:58:45,359
users to understand their their

1700
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:47,520
workflows and their needs and make sure

1701
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:48,839
they understand why you're putting this

1702
00:58:48,839 --> 00:58:50,099
control in place

1703
00:58:50,099 --> 00:58:51,960
and along those lines make sure you've

1704
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,280
got an off-ramp you know if you're about

1705
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:54,780
to come in and say you're only allowed

1706
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:55,740
to use Edge you're not allowed to use

1707
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,180
Google Chrome anymore make sure they

1708
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:59,460
understand why but also make sure you

1709
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:01,020
know their bookmarks and their favorites

1710
00:59:01,020 --> 00:59:03,660
have copied across and same goes if you

1711
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:05,220
drop if you're blocking something like a

1712
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,319
Dropbox make sure that you've told them

1713
00:59:07,319 --> 00:59:08,700
they've got time to copy the files out

1714
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,500
and shove them into OneDrive you'd be

1715
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:12,059
surprised how often people end up

1716
00:59:12,059 --> 00:59:13,799
forgetting this step and then you're

1717
00:59:13,799 --> 00:59:15,359
just fighting users the whole time and

1718
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:16,559
users are trying to find workarounds

1719
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:17,760
because I've got to get their file or

1720
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,260
they need this program to do their job

1721
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:21,839
so we can make that really easy by

1722
00:59:21,839 --> 00:59:24,980
working with them as we go through

1723
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:28,200
when we come to the tech in our

1724
00:59:28,200 --> 00:59:30,299
experience there's four key technical

1725
00:59:30,299 --> 00:59:31,920
requirements that any software product

1726
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,799
needs to be able to do application

1727
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:36,540
control properly to those kind of level

1728
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:40,319
two level three maturity controls so we

1729
00:59:40,319 --> 00:59:42,540
need centralized visibility so this is

1730
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:43,799
really crucial to see what's going on in

1731
00:59:43,799 --> 00:59:45,299
our organization you know I just

1732
00:59:45,299 --> 00:59:46,740
mentioned you know it's easier if you've

1733
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:49,260
got a soe but even with a soe we all

1734
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:50,579
live in the real world we know that

1735
00:59:50,579 --> 00:59:51,780
that's not what the environment looks

1736
00:59:51,780 --> 00:59:53,220
like so if we build an application

1737
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:55,440
control policy based off our soe we then

1738
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,900
roll that out we're going to be again in

1739
00:59:57,900 --> 00:59:59,220
this situation where we've missed stuff

1740
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:00,780
so we need to make sure we're not

1741
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:02,160
working off one machine we're working

1742
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:03,720
off every machine so make sure that's

1743
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,200
coming back

1744
01:00:06,780 --> 01:00:08,220
um you need the context at the point

1745
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:09,900
you're making the decision you know

1746
01:00:09,900 --> 01:00:11,700
you're going to be fighting the process

1747
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:14,460
if you're always having to you know grab

1748
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:15,900
the hash from there or a truck into

1749
01:00:15,900 --> 01:00:17,640
virus total and take the results and put

1750
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,680
them over there so you know make sure

1751
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,059
that you've got it all in one place

1752
01:00:21,059 --> 01:00:22,859
whether that's the tool itself whether

1753
01:00:22,859 --> 01:00:24,839
that's pumped into a seam make sure

1754
01:00:24,839 --> 01:00:26,099
you've got your kind of the dashboard

1755
01:00:26,099 --> 01:00:28,740
that you live in

1756
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:30,240
really importantly you need to be able

1757
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,819
to push update out rapidly and

1758
01:00:32,819 --> 01:00:35,220
frequently so you need to be able to get

1759
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:36,660
those changes out to users near

1760
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:39,079
instantaneously or at least very quickly

1761
01:00:39,079 --> 01:00:41,040
otherwise again they're going to have a

1762
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,299
bad time you know if something gets

1763
01:00:42,299 --> 01:00:44,220
updated you've push new software up to

1764
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:46,140
your environment and missed something

1765
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:47,940
you know we need to make sure we can fix

1766
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:50,579
those problems quickly

1767
01:00:50,579 --> 01:00:52,020
um and along the same lines we need to

1768
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:53,040
make sure we've got methods for

1769
01:00:53,040 --> 01:00:54,720
temporary exemption

1770
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,700
um so again you never know when an

1771
01:00:56,700 --> 01:00:58,619
unexpected update is going to head out

1772
01:00:58,619 --> 01:01:00,240
you never know when an exec's going to

1773
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:02,339
need to jump on some weird wacky

1774
01:01:02,339 --> 01:01:05,280
wonderful WebEx or something so we need

1775
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:08,359
to make sure you've got that in there

1776
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:11,640
so bring this all back together we need

1777
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,380
to understand our why and our what as

1778
01:01:13,380 --> 01:01:15,780
step one so again deciding your Central

1779
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:17,760
State maturity model understand what

1780
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,040
you're trying to achieve work with your

1781
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,960
cross-functional team and understand

1782
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:23,579
your users workflows to Define your

1783
01:01:23,579 --> 01:01:25,740
technical requirements

1784
01:01:25,740 --> 01:01:28,079
we jump into step two then we can now

1785
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:29,640
evaluate our technology against those

1786
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:30,839
technical requirements and those use

1787
01:01:30,839 --> 01:01:34,140
cases understand the limitations and

1788
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:36,720
keep our users day-to-day in mind so we

1789
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,339
need to find the right technology for

1790
01:01:38,339 --> 01:01:40,079
our workflow for our users and our

1791
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:42,660
environment

1792
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:45,900
step three is the plan plan some more

1793
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,819
plan again and develop your business

1794
01:01:47,819 --> 01:01:50,160
process so make sure that edge cases are

1795
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:52,380
documented make sure we know how we're

1796
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:53,700
going to handle them make sure we know

1797
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:56,099
how trust is defined and understand the

1798
01:01:56,099 --> 01:01:57,539
roles and responsibilities across the

1799
01:01:57,539 --> 01:01:59,039
teams

1800
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:01,020
and hopefully at that point you should

1801
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:03,119
be able to deploy successfully with a

1802
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:04,200
solution that's not going to disrupt our

1803
01:02:04,200 --> 01:02:06,299
users it's going to enforce the exact

1804
01:02:06,299 --> 01:02:08,339
policy we want and will massively reduce

1805
01:02:08,339 --> 01:02:11,280
the risk to your environment

1806
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,140
so again don't forget application

1807
01:02:13,140 --> 01:02:15,119
controls there to help you reduce your

1808
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:17,039
attack surface in your environment so

1809
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:18,240
feel free to start with a broad

1810
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,819
definition of trust and cut it down you

1811
