1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,120
uh hello everyone yes we're live

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:04,240
looks like the other sessions have

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,000
kicked off so we might get going here as

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,400
well because we're running behind time

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,360
um today is before i introduce jamie

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,440
just two things um

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,639
remember there's an app i hope you guys

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,000
will link to the app you can log in if

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,199
you can ask your questions in the app

10
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,119
then people can sort of crowdsource them

11
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,119
up to get the most popular questions

12
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,359
and um if you do tweet the hashtag

13
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,359
oscert202022

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,320
you guys probably know that already so

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,560
we're behind time so today's speaker is

16
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,160
jamie gillespie jamie's uh at apnic he's

17
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,600
got a fantastic accent which is um from

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,879
canada

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,879
and he's been around for a long time he

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,960
knows a lot about instant response he's

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,680
worked all kinds of places from telcos

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,039
um

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,200
and google and oscert a long time ago i

24
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,039
think i met you there then and now he's

25
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,399
at up next so

26
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,960
please welcome

27
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,160
jamie thanks very much for that um

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,399
quite interesting from the uh previous

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,400
presentation talking about donating and

30
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,880
kidney um i actually donated a kidney

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,360
last year so that's a nice little

32
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,799
connection so if you want to talk to me

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,640
about donating kidneys i'm happy to do

34
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,799
that or after this session i'm not sure

35
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,280
if i have to finish a bit early but um

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,640
if we don't have a lot of time for

37
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,040
questions come see me after the session

38
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,960
and at the the break times i'm fairly

39
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,600
easy to spot in a crowd so let's get

40
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,080
started um so the presentation today

41
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,159
we're looking at is a vulnerability

42
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,560
reporting on a shoestring budget

43
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,799
so just a bit of background about ap

44
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,960
nick to to set the tone on why we're

45
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,439
running on a shoestring budget so ap

46
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,799
nick is the

47
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,119
regional internet registry uh we manage

48
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,079
ip addresses and allocations for the 56

49
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,759
economies that make up the asia pacific

50
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,119
region

51
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:51,600
we're not for profit organization we're

52
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,439
purposefully open and transparent in

53
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,040
everything that we do we've got

54
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,520
approximately 120 i'm getting close to

55
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,479
130 staff now and and still hiring

56
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,040
we manage some data centers both in

57
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,600
australia and internationally we use

58
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,520
infrastructure as a service hosting on

59
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,878
aws and google multiple sas applications

60
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,599
and vendors around but we don't just run

61
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,680
typical web applications we run some of

62
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,879
the classic ones that other

63
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,959
organizations will vpns smtp dns servers

64
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,040
we also run some of the slightly more

65
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,440
unique ones like uh purposefully having

66
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,640
anonymous ftp open running whois servers

67
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,840
and rpki and even uh publicly accessible

68
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,959
rsync

69
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:36,480
on purpose um yes that is real and

70
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,080
believe it or not the internet runs on

71
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,360
some of this

72
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,840
um we do have an it team internally uh

73
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,120
actually we have two of them but they

74
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,440
work really closely together we do some

75
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,519
internal vulnerability scanning

76
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,599
external penetration tests you know the

77
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,280
usual thing that you expect an

78
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,200
organization to be doing

79
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,040
we also have internal developers that

80
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,959
are writing new applications both for

81
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,680
use internally web apps as well as

82
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,879
c coded

83
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,840
proper compiled binaries

84
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,480
neck has a c cert team it was created

85
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,720
internally to formalize our incident

86
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,760
response procedures and just overall uh

87
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,519
information security work that is going

88
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:15,599
on everything from security awareness

89
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,319
through to preparation for 27 0001

90
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,720
so early vulnerability reports that we

91
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,360
were getting in um we didn't really have

92
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,599
a proper security point of contact at

93
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,200
least not one that we were advertising

94
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,519
externally so if there was security

95
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,000
researchers that were wanting to report

96
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,640
vulnerabilities or security issues to us

97
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,159
they would be reaching out to our

98
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,239
privacy ad email address or sometimes

99
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,200
even hr or just random email addresses

100
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,840
that may or may not have existed

101
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,840
maybe reaching out on facebook and even

102
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,560
linkedin contacts trying to contact us

103
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,480
and of course those are not the best

104
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,640
ways sometimes they'll get dropped

105
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,319
sometimes they'll take a while to get

106
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,599
routed to us

107
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,799
hr

108
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,280
we tell them to be suspicious of weird

109
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,959
emails so when they get these weird

110
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,799
emails they think that they're scams and

111
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,040
may or may not pass them to us

112
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,360
um we did get the original the

113
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,640
occasional actual scam message as well

114
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,080
but it's a little bit different in the

115
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,478
sense that they don't actually say

116
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,120
anything specific uh they don't mention

117
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,040
us as an organization they don't mention

118
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,440
what website they found a vulnerability

119
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,680
in they don't mention what vulnerability

120
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,840
or even the type of vulnerability and

121
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,040
they're asking for money up front um it

122
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,120
is a scam if you take some of the words

123
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,600
and do a a strict google search on that

124
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,000
you'll actually find that this is a

125
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
common copy and paste scam just trying

126
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,720
to get money and uh probably not even

127
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,560
give you any security advice at the end

128
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,240
or or something simple like you're

129
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,479
missing an spf uh dns record or

130
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,120
something like that

131
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,639
so the the the conception of our vrp

132
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:56,560
program you know started off with well

133
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,160
we should have a security point of

134
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,560
contact for security researchers to

135
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,840
contact us

136
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,720
um

137
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,639
and then we'll need to publish that

138
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,400
somehow we'll need to advertise it so

139
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,280
people know how to contact us

140
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,680
but if we're advertising a random email

141
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,639
address we would need to set some rules

142
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,479
uh we want to make sure that people use

143
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,800
the email address for the right purposes

144
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,400
and they're contacting us in the way

145
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,479
that makes sense for both parties um now

146
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,240
this sounds a lot like a bug bounty

147
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,600
program when you start adding all of

148
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,320
these things together um but we're a

149
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,320
not-for-profit organization we're not

150
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,440
huge uh we don't have a lot of financial

151
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,800
backing for

152
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,520
running uh bug bounty programs like big

153
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,520
commercial organizations do

154
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,160
so the question was could we set this up

155
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,320
and run it and would it essentially be a

156
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,479
bug bounty program with it the bounties

157
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,600
and would it work um you know it's

158
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,840
basically not a lot of effort to put it

159
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,880
up front and if we get zero reports uh

160
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,720
we didn't waste a lot of time on it so

161
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,639
it's not a big deal um but it'd be

162
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,960
interesting to see what reports people

163
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,360
would actually be sending in to us

164
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,440
so this was the start of what we called

165
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,840
the vulnerability reporting program

166
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,400
this started about two years ago when we

167
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,000
were going through the conception of

168
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,800
this at the time it was about 50 50

169
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,000
whether people were calling their

170
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,199
programs vrps or vdp or vulnerability

171
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,960
disclosure program

172
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,960
since then most organizations are

173
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,120
leaning towards vdp

174
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,360
but you know it's it's an acronym you

175
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,919
can make whatever acronym you want right

176
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,240
so we went around uh we read a lot of

177
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,400
other program texts whether they were

178
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,720
bug bounties or vulnerability disclosure

179
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,039
programs and reporting program texts

180
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,960
picking the bits and pieces that we

181
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,639
really liked from each one and putting

182
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,800
together something that made sense for

183
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,000
us and learning from hopefully what was

184
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,080
other people's mistakes and iterations

185
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,759
that they went through

186
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,840
we circulated a draft amongst the i.t

187
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,599
teams for feedback and improvements we

188
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,840
did our own little uh you know

189
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,000
role-playing to see how different people

190
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,919
would read and interpret it got that up

191
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,759
to speed

192
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,199
we then had

193
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,599
used an early template for safe harbor

194
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:11,599
language this is from a website called

195
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,680
disclose.io

196
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,280
they were just starting out with their

197
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,520
safe harbor language it was very

198
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,160
american based with american legal terms

199
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,120
and that

200
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,960
but we took that we passed it by our

201
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,680
legal team got them to australianize it

202
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,680
and make sure that it was something they

203
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,199
were comfortable with what we were

204
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,479
saying

205
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,479
and the safe harbor language was

206
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,479
starting to get really important the

207
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,840
safe harbor language if you're not

208
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,479
familiar with it basically says if you

209
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,039
do the right thing and report to us

210
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,800
we won't sue you

211
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,199
and this was because there were many

212
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,680
many and still are many instances of

213
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,919
security researchers and just random

214
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,039
people that find a vulnerability on a

215
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,440
website or in a product they contact the

216
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,599
company and they don't have a proper

217
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,840
vulnerability program they reach out and

218
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,720
they say i found a vulnerability um and

219
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,039
they get lawyers sent after them um and

220
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:07,440
it's it's got a huge chilling effect on

221
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,879
a lot of security research and

222
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,720
vulnerability research that's going on

223
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,919
out there

224
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,759
to the point where i'm seeing discussion

225
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,319
groups where people are

226
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,599
using tor and proton mail email

227
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,360
addresses in order to report

228
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,360
vulnerabilities and not wanting to take

229
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,680
credit because they're afraid of getting

230
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,960
sued

231
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,639
of course they're mostly american so you

232
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,400
know good on them for protecting

233
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,958
themselves from legal consequences

234
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,640
but this safe harbor language is getting

235
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,159
to be more important in these

236
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,000
vulnerability programs

237
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,039
um

238
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,839
dot disclosed

239
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,320
since then has actually come up with a

240
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,560
few more regionalized uh safe herber

241
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,800
languages and they even have a full

242
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,120
vulnerability disclosure program uh

243
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,040
template that you can go in and create

244
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,360
your prone program with so uh some

245
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,880
learning for you if you're going through

246
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,720
this process more recently now

247
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,720
so the layout of our actual program text

248
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,720
we broke it into a few sections here

249
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,800
we've got background introduction what's

250
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,399
in and out of scope

251
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,720
uh report details and safe harbor so

252
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,720
i'll just go through briefly what they

253
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,600
cover so the background of ap neck a lot

254
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,240
of security researchers don't

255
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,800
come and find vulnerabilities because

256
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,399
they know who we are

257
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,160
they just see a program or they're

258
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,240
scanning across using their tools and

259
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,160
they find a vulnerability and then

260
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,160
afterwards try and figure out who the

261
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,720
company is and who to report it to so we

262
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,720
give them a bit of background and we let

263
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,240
them know right up front hey we're a

264
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,320
not-for-profit organization here's what

265
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,000
we do

266
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,160
we then do the introduction to the vrp

267
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,920
where we actually call it the bug

268
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,000
reporting you know we value the hard

269
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,600
work of security researchers you know

270
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,360
the usual text that you'd put up front

271
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,399
for something

272
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,160
uh we put the email address that we

273
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,839
wanted them to contact to and that was

274
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,200
uh csert apnic.net um we did do a little

275
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,920
bit of email obfuscation to try and stay

276
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,720
off of the uh the the spamming um

277
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,800
mailing lists and so far it went pretty

278
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,079
good

279
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,079
and we also set some expectations for

280
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:10,560
the security researchers now this was an

281
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,040
interesting one that we also had to work

282
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,360
with internal teams to set expectations

283
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,519
so we made it very

284
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,240
very relaxed it was basically we aim to

285
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,279
reply within a week and we aim to close

286
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,360
off anything that is higher than an

287
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,240
informational vulnerability um in 90

288
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,959
days so that's sort of like the maximum

289
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,720
that a vulnerability program would be

290
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,800
doing you don't want to give anything

291
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,959
larger than that and this is important

292
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,440
to set the expectations because if the

293
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,240
security researchers are emailing you in

294
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,320
and they expect a reply within two or

295
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,800
three days if they don't get it they can

296
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,880
get frustrated and they can sometimes go

297
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,880
public saying hey i reported a

298
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,800
vulnerability to this company and they

299
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,880
didn't reply and they don't care about

300
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,440
security and we generally don't want

301
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,000
that kind of um

302
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,560
bad pr uh going across twitter and

303
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,560
everything else so we set expectations

304
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,839
and we worked internally to keep to them

305
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,880
for the in-scope section um i i pushed a

306
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,440
little bit on this and i made it as wide

307
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,920
as possible we literally put in wild

308
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,560
cards that basically any domains that we

309
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,200
own we manage we control

310
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,519
i want to know about everything on these

311
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,640
domains

312
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,320
again we're not paying out money so it

313
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,480
doesn't really hurt too much but i

314
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,200
wanted to start really wide and get it

315
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,480
open as much as possible

316
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,040
then we listed a few things out of scope

317
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,519
again i didn't want to scope things out

318
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,440
too quickly because i wanted to be

319
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,440
notified about even some of the little

320
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,880
stuff that came in

321
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:47,040
but right up front we have to make the

322
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,519
statement hey some of our sub domains

323
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,079
may point off to other services and we

324
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,639
use these other services but we can't

325
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,959
authorize you to go and start hacking

326
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:00,320
against octa cloudflare zoom and similar

327
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,040
so we made that right up front

328
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,040
we didn't want any destruction of data

329
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,440
so please try not to do that don't try

330
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,800
and dos us

331
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,839
that doesn't really cover anything

332
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,680
don't social engineer us

333
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,760
we know that social engineering will be

334
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,519
successful for a certain percentage of

335
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,560
the time

336
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,360
so don't go phishing our staff members

337
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,040
because we want technical

338
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,120
vulnerabilities reported in

339
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,880
and please don't show up at our office

340
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,399
and throw a brick through the window and

341
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,800
say that our windows are not secure

342
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,040
so physical security controls are out as

343
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,199
well

344
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,720
for report details helping people along

345
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,600
there are a lot of brand new security

346
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,600
researchers out there they want to get

347
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,000
into bug bounty hunting and things and

348
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,680
they go after these free programs to

349
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,639
build up the street cred first so it's

350
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,959
nice to give a little bit of a layout

351
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,639
what information we wanted in the

352
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,760
reports

353
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,000
and we were pretty successful um i don't

354
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,760
think we got many reports that were

355
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,519
lacking information that we had to do

356
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,079
back and forth getting more details but

357
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,480
just a bit of a list here of what we

358
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,320
wanted as a report

359
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,160
and we mentioned on the report details

360
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,000
you know hey we are a not-for-profit we

361
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,399
can't pay out major bounties we really

362
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,040
appreciate your assistance so again

363
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,440
setting the expectation up front

364
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,920
and that reduced a lot of the oh hey can

365
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,600
i get some some money for this

366
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,720
vulnerability type of thing

367
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,120
we put on our safe harbor language this

368
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,720
is a short version it's about two

369
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,160
paragraphs long

370
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,920
if you conduct vulnerability research

371
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,040
that is in scope as per this program and

372
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,880
you report your findings to us in a

373
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,279
timely manner we will consider this

374
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,519
authorized and we promise not to take

375
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,519
legal action against you because

376
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,320
essentially if it's not authorized it

377
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,720
could be like a couple different federal

378
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,720
crimes they're committing both for

379
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,680
whatever

380
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,199
economy and country that they're coming

381
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,199
from as well as australian

382
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,519
telecommunications laws so

383
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,120
putting that up front everybody's

384
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,120
covered

385
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,440
we also went through we created a gpg

386
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,519
key just in case anybody wanted to

387
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,920
encrypt any of the reports being sent in

388
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,240
because it was just going over email

389
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,680
we also created a security.txt file this

390
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,160
if you haven't seen these before it's a

391
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,279
an evolution of the robots.txt

392
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,519
where it's in a well-known directory

393
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,360
literally it's a directory called well

394
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,480
known

395
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,399
where you put your security txt and you

396
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,320
can see the information there you can

397
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,199
also

398
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,240
sign your security txt file to prove

399
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,800
that the gpg or pgp key that you're

400
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,519
using is the one relating to it

401
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,040
there is a website that can help you

402
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,120
craft these up they are plain text so

403
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,399
you can do it by hand but

404
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,079
securitytxt.org

405
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,000
was a nice little resource to make sure

406
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,079
that we were keeping things compliant

407
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:54,160
for anybody that was caring about that

408
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,199
so

409
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,360
looking on the receiving end of the

410
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,240
reports that came in so our it teams

411
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,639
were receiving reports uh we had a

412
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,399
ticketing system that we used internally

413
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,880
already so we just created a bit of a

414
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,320
queue for that one

415
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,839
we had the email address csert apnik.net

416
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,600
um we were using that for internal

417
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,000
purposes um we were subscribing to

418
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,160
different vulnerability notifications

419
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,760
from different vendors and having that

420
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,079
come in but it was a really great email

421
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,800
address and we wanted to use that one as

422
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,600
part of our our public program so we

423
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,759
switched things around used that and

424
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,360
ended up using that for the public side

425
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,360
of things

426
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,519
our it teams would manage the upgrades

427
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,440
of any of the third party software that

428
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,360
we were purchasing and using you know

429
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,880
your your standard uh wordpress and any

430
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,880
of the apache nginx the operating

431
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,279
systems themselves um typical things

432
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,000
that an it team would be working on

433
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,480
um and then as we were going through and

434
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,560
doing some internal tabletops to you

435
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,000
know practice how things would be

436
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,800
working um it was like oh hang on what

437
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,320
about these other websites and

438
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,399
applications that we're running uh that

439
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,320
were created internally it's like oh

440
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,040
that's right the developers um

441
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,880
and we went and talked to the developers

442
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,079
and it was sort of like hey we weren't

443
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,600
forgetting about you we're running this

444
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,759
program i'm honest we weren't forgetting

445
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:16,959
about you

446
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,279
and that started leading to a whole

447
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,120
separate discussion because initially it

448
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,000
was the it teams and upgrading software

449
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,519
that you know had patches available for

450
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,920
so at this point it was like oh hey

451
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,839
we're going to be doing this thing where

452
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,480
we ask people to hack our systems and

453
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,920
we're going to be getting vulnerability

454
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,240
reports and some of them are going to be

455
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,900
about your software so

456
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,440
[Music]

457
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,560
um

458
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,360
it

459
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,920
it had some interesting discussions it

460
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,440
had a little bit of back and forth as

461
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,880
you can imagine

462
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,040
but we basically worked with them to

463
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,399
inject into their development cycle into

464
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,600
their release cycle as well so from here

465
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,519
we were looking at confirming

466
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,600
vulnerabilities to make sure that when

467
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,600
we send them something we need them to

468
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,679
reply quickly to confirm whether it is a

469
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,439
vulnerability or not

470
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,839
to work on fixing the vulnerability in

471
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,520
the time frames that we're trying to

472
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,919
advertise here to go through testing

473
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,160
procedures and work with us on testing

474
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,480
so that we can make sure that the

475
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,799
fix actually close the vulnerability

476
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,039
properly completely

477
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,880
and then their release cycles for

478
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,880
pushing into production to make sure

479
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,679
that they can get pushed maybe a little

480
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,200
bit quicker or on a a slightly reduced

481
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,960
schedule for what they may have normally

482
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,000
been doing

483
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,480
so it was a really good experience to

484
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,400
work with the development team and

485
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,160
really get some security processes

486
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,720
working with them

487
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,320
so we had a bit of a premature birth for

488
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,559
our uh vulnerability reporting program

489
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,799
just five days before we were going to

490
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,559
be publishing the website with the

491
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:57,280
program and everybody uh and everything

492
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,880
um someone actually sent us a

493
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,200
vulnerability report i think i'd put the

494
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,440
security txt file up so they actually

495
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,240
had found the security txt um found a

496
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,080
vulnerability and sent us an email

497
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,480
report before the program actually went

498
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,960
live so uh it was quite interesting it

499
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,919
was a an actual vulnerability not just a

500
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,080
bit of a low-level thing so cross-site

501
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,640
scripting in a display name field so it

502
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,799
was a reflected cross-site script oh no

503
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,400
sorry this one was stored cross-site

504
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,280
scripting so it was a real vulnerability

505
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,200
gave us a good way of testing our

506
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,520
procedures testing how everything was

507
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,200
running because we didn't want to get

508
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,760
flooded you know the fear was what if we

509
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,400
get 10 reports right away and we have

510
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,440
trouble

511
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,600
managing them with the other work that

512
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,679
the it teams are doing with the other

513
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,160
work that the developers are doing so uh

514
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,320
was a good testing for that it also led

515
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,160
us to add a thank you section sort of

516
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,200
like a hall of fame section onto our vrp

517
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,320
website uh page um and giving thanks to

518
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,480
them so thanks to denny who is our uh

519
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,400
our early bird security researcher

520
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,640
reporting in

521
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,240
so when we wanted the program to

522
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,799
actually go live we finally published

523
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,960
the webpage that had all of the program

524
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,080
text that i detailed before

525
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,160
then about five days later

526
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,880
we then put up a blog post now the blog

527
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,520
post was on our own blog and this was

528
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,400
pretty much the extent of advertising of

529
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,960
the program again we wanted to start

530
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,880
slow we weren't sure if it was going to

531
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,440
get a lot of attention or not so we went

532
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,039
for a very

533
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,600
calm and quiet way of advertising that

534
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,120
the program was was running

535
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,520
so the number of vulnerability reports

536
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,480
um here you can see as uh month by month

537
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,400
it did start off nice and slow it was

538
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,799
great one report a month it helped us

539
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,799
you know slowly go through get people

540
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,120
involved you know do deeper dives into

541
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,919
the program and the reports how we were

542
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,640
doing replies and everything went really

543
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,280
really well

544
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,960
and

545
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:03,360
then then it picked up

546
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,000
so you can see here it's um spiking up

547
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,600
to about 13 reports in one month um and

548
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,400
that was quite a lot and this was with

549
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,880
no additional advertising of the program

550
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,000
we didn't

551
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,320
go out on any of the other websites we

552
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,039
didn't announce it anywhere else

553
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,880
there's a bit of suspicion that it might

554
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,000
have been

555
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,840
one of the hacker

556
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,080
pen testing boot camps actually picked

557
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,840
up and saw a new program so they

558
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,400
advertised it to their local group of

559
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,760
the new people that were going through

560
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,520
their pentest boot camp program um

561
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,840
there's also some you know quiet

562
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,520
assumptions that could be made a lot of

563
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,360
these reports were coming from slightly

564
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,080
more northern hemisphere

565
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,159
that's around the time of uh christmas

566
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,400
time and then summertime which may be

567
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,120
school breaks as well so you know a bit

568
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,120
of assumptions but a lot of the people

569
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,360
reporting we didn't get a lot of details

570
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,679
from them so you know it is what it is

571
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:00,799
from there

572
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,720
um we did have some quiet times went

573
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,640
back to one report a month and then it

574
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,360
went back up again um so you know this

575
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,280
worked out really well when you look at

576
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,880
this as the orange line as the

577
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,799
cumulative number

578
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,400
just over a year

579
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,559
just under a year and a half we ended up

580
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,640
with 81

581
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,720
unique reported vulnerabilities that

582
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,400
came through

583
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,520
which was absolutely amazing

584
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,760
so let's break these down

585
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,799
and see what were these 81 reports

586
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,960
so we had 16 that were information

587
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,120
disclosure low level information

588
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,320
disclosure

589
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,080
maybe exposing

590
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,400
version numbers or exposing some log

591
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,159
files that didn't have anything that was

592
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,559
sensitive in them but the things that

593
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,080
you know shouldn't have been disclosed

594
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,440
in the first place

595
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,039
we had 10 reports that were for

596
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,280
reflected cross-site scripting so that's

597
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,039
where it's not stored in the database

598
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,280
it's simply just brought in by the url

599
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,600
and then displayed back in the web page

600
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,480
um

601
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,120
five reports of denial of service uh

602
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,440
five

603
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,600
they were they were technically denial

604
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,840
of service they didn't dos our systems

605
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,919
but they basically went in and said hey

606
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,400
you don't have rate limiting on this it

607
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,000
could lead to a dos attack it's like

608
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
cool thank you for not actually

609
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,919
executing a dos on us

610
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,600
five reports of stored cross-site

611
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,520
scripting so we're getting a little bit

612
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,760
a little bit higher priorities here and

613
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,400
four click jacking attacks we actually

614
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,559
ended up with three priority one so

615
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,320
priority one's the highest priority for

616
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,799
this system we ended up with three p1

617
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,840
events

618
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,120
these were sql injection and sensitive

619
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,679
information disclosure so you can see

620
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,840
the nice little graph there as you'd

621
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,760
expect the lower level stuff has the

622
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,840
most number of vulnerabilities

623
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,960
so

624
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,679
uh

625
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,240
one of those p1 vulnerabilities actually

626
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,480
turned into an incident um so this was

627
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,799
something that we weren't really

628
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,280
preparing for we didn't have a standard

629
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,520
operating procedure or playbook for this

630
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,080
so we basically quickly converted it to

631
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,640
our incident response plan

632
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,919
this one

633
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,320
ended up where the sensitive information

634
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,520
was actually a google cloud bucket sort

635
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,600
of like an s3 bucket that was not

636
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,280
properly secured

637
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,120
and that in itself wasn't a problem

638
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,039
because it shouldn't have had sensitive

639
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,679
data in it but that then was combined

640
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:24,320
with an accidental backup copy of a

641
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,559
database that did have some sensitive

642
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:29,280
data in it so those two things combined

643
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,960
uh turn this vulnerability into an

644
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,440
incident uh we went through

645
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,960
managed it internally did our

646
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,280
communications with affected parties and

647
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,600
then as the responsible organizational

648
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,760
thing to do we then made a public

649
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,600
announcement about what was happening

650
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,520
and and what went through so it was

651
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,520
picked up by a couple media outlets

652
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,919
because we went public so of course they

653
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,720
can make it public um but yeah it was it

654
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,200
was an interesting one luckily it didn't

655
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,640
have any uh large or lasting damage but

656
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,120
it did require us to go through review

657
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,799
all the sensitive information that was

658
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:03,919
there

659
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,559
luckily it didn't quite make it to

660
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,400
notifiable data breach it wasn't

661
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,600
information that would have caused uh

662
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,200
significant damage to the affected

663
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,480
parties so yay on that part of it um but

664
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,440
it was an interesting case and again

665
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,520
this was one of those cases where hey

666
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,520
this really bad thing happened

667
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,000
but isn't this a great success story for

668
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,760
the vulnerability reporting program

669
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,919
because this was a random security

670
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,400
researcher who reported it into us

671
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,559
and was not asking for a bounty we

672
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,960
didn't have to pay them anything out um

673
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,200
and our systems are more secure because

674
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,240
of it so really awesome results it was

675
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,840
one of those great things it's like if

676
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,400
we don't get reports that's okay if we

677
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,240
do get lots of reports well that's a

678
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,000
success measure as well so it's it's

679
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,799
almost a win-win

680
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:55,520
this is a nice breakdown of all the

681
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,039
different classes of vulnerabilities

682
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,440
that came through the red highlighted

683
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:00,960
ones in the bottom of the middle there

684
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,360
the sensitive information and sql those

685
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,080
ones are the p1's the orange ones on the

686
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,640
left and right hand side the dos stored

687
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,320
cross-site scripting and host header

688
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,960
poisoning those were p2 incidents so

689
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,080
still quite high priority incidents for

690
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,400
us to manage and close them off

691
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,640
the host header poisoning was quite an

692
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,919
interesting one

693
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,600
took a lot of work for them to go

694
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,679
through and actually would have been

695
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,559
almost an authentication bypass so

696
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,200
really amazing to get that found and get

697
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,840
that closed off

698
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,960
um

699
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,400
i don't think there's anything else too

700
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,000
interesting in here

701
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,039
you know you can see the one of eat on

702
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,279
the right-hand side some of those are

703
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,440
very lower priority things that weren't

704
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,520
really too serious but you know we

705
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,919
closed them off because we can and we

706
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:52,240
should

707
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,520
so who was reporting the vulnerabilities

708
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,640
to us so we had 45 security researchers

709
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,200
that sent in one single report each we

710
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,120
had nine researchers that sent in two

711
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,760
reports each three that sent in three

712
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,240
one researchers sent in four reports and

713
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,640
another researcher sent in five reports

714
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,039
which was really awesome from them

715
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,200
most of the multiple reports came in on

716
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,360
the same day so they were doing a lot of

717
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,360
work in a short period of time as

718
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,440
opposed to a long-running

719
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,520
engagement with us

720
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,440
half of them were for the same service

721
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,000
so the security researchers were poking

722
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,520
around on one system in a lot of

723
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,840
different ways and the other half were

724
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,080
across different services so they were

725
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,600
looking for the same class of

726
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,320
vulnerability across different services

727
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,000
in our network so

728
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,240
quite a mixture of ways that security

729
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,480
researchers are approaching

730
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,200
a program like this

731
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,159
we also received 33 duplicate reports so

732
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,480
the reports that were shown here were

733
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,279
unique and verified so anything that is

734
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,080
spam was excluded and the duplicates are

735
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,080
excluded from these numbers and graphs

736
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,400
that were shown before

737
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,480
most of these duplicate reports were

738
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,080
within the first four months of the

739
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,320
program while things ramped up very

740
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,679
quickly

741
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,679
so people were finding the same sorts of

742
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:13,919
things at around the same time so we

743
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,360
closed them off

744
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,440
merged it back in with the main one

745
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,200
and didn't have to give credit it's

746
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,880
credit only for the first person who

747
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,520
reports in

748
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,960
so some of the lessons that we learned

749
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,760
from this program so vrps vdps and

750
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,440
whatever you want to call them are

751
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,360
useful to complement your existing

752
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,600
security controls tools and practices

753
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,000
that you may have having that extra set

754
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,440
of eyes or you know 80 extra sets of

755
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:44,399
eyes across your systems helps you find

756
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,320
the things that you might have sort of

757
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,799
had a blind spot on or didn't have the

758
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,279
tools and technology to go deep into

759
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,200
some of your systems where some of these

760
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,880
vulnerabilities are going to be

761
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,399
especially if you're writing some of the

762
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,559
code yourself you can't just look up

763
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,480
version numbers for tools that are

764
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,399
publicly written and exposed

765
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,080
good communication with internal

766
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,559
stakeholder stakeholders is really

767
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,399
important this is when you're creating

768
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:11,919
the program when you're launching the

769
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:14,080
program and while the program has been

770
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,799
running so the before

771
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,799
really important to find the developers

772
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,399
find everybody who's going to be

773
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,200
affected once the program is running

774
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,039
while it's running people want to know

775
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,200
what's going on and keeping that

776
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,600
communication open both ways because

777
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,360
it's not just good enough for you to

778
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,799
tell an internal team about a

779
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,399
vulnerability you need to get

780
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,159
information back so you can then

781
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,399
communicate with the external reporter

782
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,399
and let them know again

783
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,399
trying to stop them from having a bad

784
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:44,320
experience and ending up on twitter

785
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,679
saying ap next security sucks

786
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:50,000
and after launch one thing that has

787
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,120
worked out really well is we've embedded

788
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,360
even more security engagement with our

789
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,159
developers so we now have a fortnightly

790
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,240
uh all developers meeting where they

791
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,120
discuss you know technical uh controls

792
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,960
looking at architecture but we've got a

793
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,360
standing security item where we go over

794
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,799
any of the vulnerabilities that have

795
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,120
been reported in the past two weeks and

796
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,520
we look at the root causes for them so

797
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,120
we're not after a blame game for

798
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,360
individual vulnerabilities but hey we

799
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,360
got three vulnerabilities that all

800
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,559
relate to

801
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,600
uh input validation and not sanitizing

802
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,080
input so you know raising that doing a

803
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:28,720
little short point in time education to

804
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,039
the developers so that hopefully new

805
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,279
issues don't get introduced further down

806
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,440
the track

807
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,600
having standard operating procedures and

808
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,399
response templates makes things really

809
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:41,919
easy for the people that need to be

810
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,440
handling them and make sure that you

811
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,600
have a consistent response there's

812
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,000
nothing worse than having different i.t

813
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,559
on-call engineers having to write the

814
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,039
same type of information but using their

815
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,200
own language maybe using it maybe a

816
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,880
little bit incorrectly

817
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,559
english being english being a second

818
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,520
language for some of them and then also

819
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,159
the end of the reporter who's receiving

820
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:06,240
this reply may be misreading it

821
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,919
misunderstanding it there could be some

822
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,240
language issues as well so having

823
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,640
standardized templates copy and paste

824
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,399
makes it easier makes for clear

825
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:18,159
communication and clear expectations

826
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,480
uh bounties aren't required to launch a

827
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,919
vrp you know 81 reports in just under a

828
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:27,120
year and a half is an amazing result i'm

829
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,640
sure there's other numbers that haven't

830
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,960
been published that may be better but i

831
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,880
think it's been an excellent result from

832
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,320
here with zero bounties being paid out

833
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,799
and management reporting gets harder the

834
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,720
more security vulnerability reports that

835
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,880
you get in and the more detail that they

836
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,720
want you know we did the standard thing

837
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,039
we started off with a spreadsheet

838
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,360
and it very quickly got a little bit out

839
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,600
of hand so it turned into a large

840
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,880
spreadsheet

841
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,440
some of the management were

842
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,679
management team were asking for you know

843
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,080
time frames from a certain point in time

844
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,320
to another point in time across all the

845
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,320
vulnerabilities but we weren't tracking

846
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,080
those we were only tracking initial

847
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,720
report and closure not the times in the

848
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,679
middle

849
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,240
so we had to expand the spreadsheet it

850
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,240
made it a little more difficult to uh to

851
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,399
deal with

852
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,720
so what's happened since then um around

853
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,480
the one year mark of operations we

854
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,039
started comparing different uh

855
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,320
commercial organizations that do vdp

856
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,519
programs

857
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,320
they come in they handle the triage and

858
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,720
deduplication and initial communication

859
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,559
uh we selected hacker one from that

860
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,559
program it was it was really close but

861
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,000
you know they all do roughly the same

862
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
sort of thing so we've gone with hacker

863
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,640
one um hacker one now receives the

864
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,519
reports do the initial communication do

865
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,279
the triaging

866
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,600
make sure that deduplication happens and

867
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,679
that it's legitimate for our systems and

868
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:54,080
then we only get the report after it's

869
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,919
all being cleaned up and it's basically

870
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,000
here it is in a nice easy to digest

871
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,120
format

872
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,559
our it teams then only have to route

873
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:05,360
that report to the correct internal team

874
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,840
and then pass it back and forth so a lot

875
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,440
less work for our internal teams to

876
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,799
manage from

877
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,679
hackerone also does some advertising so

878
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,600
we've actually gone a little bit more

879
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,720
public with the program from there

880
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,600
we've updated our vrp webpage we've uh

881
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,919
removed the email address as the primary

882
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,000
way we're putting in the hackerone form

883
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,399
so that we get formatted structured

884
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:30,240
information rather than just free form

885
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,840
email coming in

886
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,919
we've expanded the out of scope list

887
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,919
there's a few things that people

888
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:38,000
routinely kept coming at to us and

889
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,240
saying you know oh my god you have ftp

890
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,679
open to the world it's like yeah it's

891
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:44,399
all good it's expected um the ones that

892
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,480
were a little bit uh more

893
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,720
interested in it said oh my god not only

894
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,799
do you have ftp but you have all of

895
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,720
these security certificates and it's

896
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,919
like yeah those are the public keys

897
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,000
those have to be exposed and you know

898
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,720
the uh the revocation certificates those

899
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,640
have to be exposed as well so it's all

900
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,360
good thank you for noticing though um

901
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,440
rate limiting issues that didn't deal

902
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,000
with authentication yeah you're going to

903
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,080
be able to ddos anything on the internet

904
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,240
um so if it's not ddosing our

905
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,480
authentication don't worry about it

906
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,799
similarly cookies yeah cookies need to

907
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:21,840
be secured but in reality if the cookie

908
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,559
is just relating to just tracking it

909
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,559
doesn't give any special access so if

910
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,159
the cookies aren't relating to

911
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:29,519
authentication

912
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,200
yeah we don't want to hear about it um

913
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,120
you know some of the third third-party

914
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,720
cookies don't come as http only or

915
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,919
secure but again there's no

916
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:42,240
privileged access relating to them

917
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,080
um and of course the the hall of fame

918
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,480
the the thank you list has grown a lot

919
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,200
um and overall ap nick is more secure of

920
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,840
it um so it's been a really successful

921
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,120
program for us um and it's been great to

922
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,559
be able to show

923
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,200
this to all of you uh in case that

924
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,640
you're thinking the same things and

925
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,960
wondering if a program can be run

926
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,600
without bounties what the success can be

927
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,279
and what types of vulnerabilities might

928
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,960
be found and reported

929
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,040
um so with that

930
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,679
that's the end

931
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,199
