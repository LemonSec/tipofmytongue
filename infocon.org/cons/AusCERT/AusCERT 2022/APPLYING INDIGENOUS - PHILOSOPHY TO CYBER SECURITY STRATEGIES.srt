so

23
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,680
before i deep dive into this really

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,000
complex topic i would like to take a

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,159
moment to acknowledge the traditional

26
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,760
custodians of the land that we are

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,240
gathered on today the land of the jugan

28
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,000
bear people

29
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,840
i would like to pay respect to the

30
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,720
elders past present and emerging

00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,000
nations people in attendance today

i would also like to thank

34
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,079
the first nations men and women who have

35
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:32,159
took the time to help contribute to this

36
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,280
speech

37
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,680
their support has been truly invaluable

38
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,520
now before i go any further into my

39
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,040
research

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,799
i just want to take some time to talk

41
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,600
about my research focus and my history

42
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,920
so i recently completed a bachelor of

43
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,759
international relations

44
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,920

00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,159
university

46
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,560
i am now studying a masters of national

47
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,880

49
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,960
anu

50
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,280
i will be doing my master's thesis

51
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,680
on applying first nations philosophy to

52
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,080
national security strategies and i'll

53
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,680
also be doing my phd on the same topic

54
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,599
i was honoured to be selected as one of

55
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,760
seven australian women to receive the

56
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,520
national security college scholarship

oni and a bunch of other letters

59
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,080
[Laughter]

60
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,040
the 100 scholarship recognized me as a

61
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,800
standout leader in security with a

62
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,120
diverse background and skill set that

63
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,120
can help advance australia's national

64
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,800
interests

65
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,720
i'm a governance risk and compliance

66
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,280
security advisor for trustwave and i

67
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,440
recently interned as a counterterrorism

68
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,360
specialist at the southcom latin america

69
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,920
counter-terrorism group for um in the

70
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,599
united states

71
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,680
now in 2021

72
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,680
i was fortunate enough to be selected

73
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,200
for an initiative called project

74
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,640
friedman

75
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,280
and project friedman is sponsored by asd

76
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,680
and women speak cyber

77
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,080
now the project chose 20 australian

78
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,959
women

79
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,599
who are future cyber security leaders

80
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,920
and funded public speaking training to

81
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,560
speak at a cyber security conference

82
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,560
now as part of project friedman i was

83
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,959
really fortunate to receive professional

84
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,959
mentoring from a company called batum

85
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,200
solutions to help in the creation of

86
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,120
today's speech

87
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,720
and i was encouraged to think about my

88
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,120
speech in accordance with where i am now

89
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,920
in life and my knowledge is a proud

90
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,319
torres strait islander woman

91
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,120
in consultation with pip jenkinson and

92
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,360
jack reese who are the co-founders of

93
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,680
batum solutions we arrived at the

94
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,280
conclusion that cyber security

95
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,400
strategies

96
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,239
can be strengthened by harnessing

97
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,080
aboriginal and torres strait islander

98
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,760
philosophies

99
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,040
now that i've gone through a little bit

100
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,720
of that backstory

101
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,560
let's talk about the research focus for

102
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,680
today

103
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,519
now the research focus

104
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,080
is that cyber security strategies can be

105
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,560
strengthened by utilizing an aboriginal

106
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,200
and torres strait islander philosophies

107
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,720
now the reason i use the word

108
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,920
philosophies here is because each tribe

109
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,799
and each clan has a unique set of

110
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,120
knowledge and cultural practices

111
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,478
however

112
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,519
i will refer to this today as philosophy

113
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,960
because there are a core set of

114
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,040
strengths that we can see across all

115
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,680
first nations groups

116
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,400
now to demonstrate the research focus

117
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,639
i'll first start by explaining what i

118
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,360
mean by first nations philosophy and

119
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,840
cyber security in the context of this

120
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,199
speech

121
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,440
i'll then discuss three elements of

122
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,720
indigenous philosophy including ethics

123
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,560
autonomous regard

124
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,840
and moral wisdom and adaptability

125
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,639
so

126
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,880
i'll then expand on this link

127
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,120
and discuss my viewpoints of why i think

128
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,440
it would be advantageous to consider

129
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,600
this knowledge in first nations not in

130
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,680
cyber security strategies

131
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,000
now to end the topic i want to provide

132
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,320
some practical points of consideration

133
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,680
for everyone in the room to take away

134
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,919
so with that being said

135
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,479
what exactly do i mean by first nations

136
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,240
philosophy

137
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,120
well as you can see on my handy diagram

138
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,639
cultural practices and law l-o-r-e

139
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,440
is at the heart of indigenous beliefs

140
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,560
systems

141
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,560
rules and obligations

142
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,960
are ways of living that provide guidance

143
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,600
to first nations people

144
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,280
now you might be wondering what do i

145
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:39,919
mean by law l-o-r-e versus law law

146
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,800
well cultural law loe has been passed

147
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,440
down from generation to generation

148
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,000
for the past 65 000 years and you might

149
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,680
have a more european connotation with

150
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,400
that word in terms of fairy tales

151
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,960
but to us this outlines our relationship

152
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,240
to place and all things in our place

153
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,280
it also shows that first nations people

154
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,680
have a responsibility to look after the

155
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,840
world that we live in

156
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,120
again

157
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,560
rules obligations and systems

158
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,160
now those elements that i mentioned

159
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,960
before the adaptability autonomous

160
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,400
regard ethical and moral wisdom

161
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,360
that all fits under rules obligations

162
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,880
and systems

163
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,199
and it's a bit like an ecosystem right

164
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,600
all of these concepts interrelate and

165
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,520
they interconnect

166
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,440
now

167
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,680
if we look at cyber security i

168
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,880
personally

169
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,479
like to think of it a bit like an

170
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,000
ecosystem

171
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,960
cyber policy trade policy

172
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,680
disaster and emergency response social

173
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,160
well-being and health care

174
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,960
all interrelate and interconnect in some

175
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,759
way shape or form

176
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,000
now the things that we do in cyber

177
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,720
have direct implications for the other

178
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,919
policy areas on the screen

179
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,120
in turn

180
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,360
this impacts our diplomatic relations

181
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,960
with countries

182
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,520
and it's much like an ecosystem we need

183
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,759
everything to function as best as

184
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:12,960
possible at optimal efficiency or else

185
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,440
our diplomatic standing and our best

186
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,039
interests can be placed at risk

187
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,319
now

188
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,319
i'm going to talk about something called

189
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:24,560
the digital divide

190
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,319
and while it may seem like it goes

191
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,039
against the purpose of my speech today

192
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,800
i think it's really important that we as

193
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,080
an industry

194
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
recognize some of the barriers that

195
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,880
currently exist when we try to foster

196
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,000
diversity and talent

197
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,120
so

198
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,240
first of all

199
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,319
the digital divide stems from the

200
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,120
australian digital inclusion index

201
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,599
and that tracks and reports on digital

202
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,240
inclusion across the country in regards

203
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,160
to a range of people including first

204
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,400
nations people with disabilities and

205
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,199
people who live below the poverty line

206
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,440
now this report did demonstrate some

207
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,639
concerning

208
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,879
statistics regarding the access

209
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,280
affordability and availability

210
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,400
of technology for first nations people

211
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,479
and that first nations people

212
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,199
face significant risk and disadvantages

213
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,280
online

214
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,440
for starters one in four indigenous

215
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,879
people and homes don't have internet

216
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,440
now this is a barrier to education to

217
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,879
health care

218
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,639
and to a range of other important things

219
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,000
that we all need in this day and age

220
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,440
but with the bad

221
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,559
also comes the good because this report

222
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,719
also highlighted that indigenous

223
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,519
australians use social media in unique

224
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,279
ways such as connecting between

225
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,160
generations connecting with culture

226
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,000
and connecting with indigenous people

227
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,120
globally

228
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,959
now statistically

229
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,279
the report found that indigenous people

230
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,240
in australia use social media at a

231
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,440
higher rate than non-indigenous people

232
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,240
and that they adapted quicker than any

233
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,720
other user group in the country

234
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,839
now this shows an ability to adapt and a

235
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,600
willingness to learn

236
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,080
if those barriers can be removed quicker

237
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,880
now speaking of adaptability

238
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,320
i'm going to move on to our first

239
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,000
element

240
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,640
what do i mean by adaptability

241
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,760
in first nations philosophy

242
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,000
well

243
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,440
it is non-linear thinking

244
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,040
and that is used to get to the root

245
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,000
cause of the issue at hand

246
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,880
now

247
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,360
there is an inherent adaptability

248
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,839
and ingenuity that stems from the

249
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:43,760
spiritual and physical realms of our

250
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,440
lives

251
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,600
it can harness indirect management

252
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,880
strategies

253
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,839
and strong analysis capabilities to help

254
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,560
create holistic outcomes

255
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,800
and the overall outcome here is quite

256
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,480
simply holistic

257
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,480
all factors are taken into consideration

258
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,279
but what do i mean by adaptability

259
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,440
in cyber security

260
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,560
well

261
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,000
cyber threats need non-linear thinking

262
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,560
we are in an inherently

263
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,560
evolving rapidly evolving industry

264
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,240
the threats we face

265
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,079
might not be the threats that we face in

266
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,680
a month's time

267
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,920
and we have to critically think

268
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,720
and have a solutions based approach to

269
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,079
address new capability gaps

270
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,480
and the outcome here

271
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,680
is to have resilient strategies

272
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,560
now

273
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,240
without going into

274
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,480
too much detail about this

275
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,079
this is what our response to threats

276
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,440
first look like

277
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,079
with seven core phases

278
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,320
and now this is the miter attack

279
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,399
framework which demonstrates how our

280
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,560
industry has adapted to the changing

281
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,200
threat landscape now i'm not saying one

282
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,240
has replaced the other but i'm saying we

283
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,560
have had to adapt and consider over 300

284
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,800
sub-techniques in this framework to deal

285
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,319
with the threats that we now face

286
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,959
now i'm gonna switch pace really quick

287
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,680
who here had a cup of coffee today

288
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,720
yeah

289
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,320
me too

290
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,360
so

291
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,880
what was needed to make that cup of

292
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,000
coffee

293
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,600
coffee beans

294
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,440
milk a cup

295
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,760
sugar water

296
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,040
what would happen

297
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,360
if we took away the coffee beans

298
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,240
you don't have a cup of coffee

299
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,640
what happens if you took away

300
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,480
the water

301
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,959
you don't have a cup of coffee and if

302
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:41,200
you took away the cup then you still

303
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,240
don't have a cup of coffee

304
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,120
why

305
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,120
because in this example

306
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,440
the whole is greater than the sum of its

307
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,040
parts

308
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,639
now when we talk about applying

309
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,079
philosophy

310
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:54,839
to

311
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,920
strategy who better to reference than

312
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,680
one of the most respected philosophers

313
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,320
of all time aristotle

314
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,240
so let's pretend that cup of coffee i

315
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,600
mentioned before

316
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,639
is now a cyber security strategy

317
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,680
we must include all parts in a national

318
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,040
cyber security strategy that is robust

319
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,000
executable outcomes focused and

320
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,680
defendable

321
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,000
and i think that we can all agree that

322
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,519
as an industry

323
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,920
the threats we face are complex and

324
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,920
constantly evolving

325
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,040
so

326
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,800
how can the use of first nations

327
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,079
philosophy

328
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,880
benefit us as an industry when we look

329
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,279
at adaptability

330
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,320
well if we apply aristotle's statement

331
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,240
then we can argue that it would be

332
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,959
advantageous for the combination of

333
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,200
different worldviews to be taken into

334
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,160
consideration when strategizing so that

335
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,399
we can have a nuance in how we think as

336
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,320
an industry

337
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,120
now

338
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,959
i think it's fair to say that we as an

339
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,360
industry we understand that some

340
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,680
individuals on the neurodiverse spectrum

341
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,360
are better than others at solving

342
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
complex coding problems

343
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,760
finding vulnerability problems

344
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,320
embedded in code much more efficiently

345
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,240
than those who are not on the spectrum

346
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,440
certifications and skills in this

347
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,560
example

348
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,560
are not relevant

349
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,360
we are harnessing a different thought

350
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,279
process

351
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:26,000
now if we can accept that as an industry

352
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,639
then let's introduce cultural knowledge

353
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,880
a culture of 65 000 years

354
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,600
who understands space who understands

355
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,519
how everything interconnects and

356
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,519
interrelates

357
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,120
and i believe that it would be

358
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,120
advantageous for this knowledge to be

359
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,160
harnessed

360
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,320
because it can create alternative

361
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,480
solutions to threats

362
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,720
assist in tackling capability gaps and

363
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,399
concerns

364
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,720
combining world views to create new

365
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,240
strategies

366
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,320
and these worldviews could include a

367
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,560
combination approach where we harness

368
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,480
what we have learnt under western

369
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,760
philosophies

370
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,160
as well as what we have learnt as part

371
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,360
of indigenous philosophy

372
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,040
and i also think it would be beneficial

373
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,440
because you can examine all the elements

374
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,920
of a cyber threat and how that threat

375
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,480
fits into the ecosystem that i mentioned

376
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,920
before

377
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,680
now it can also provide the local

378
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,760
context of situations

379
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,160
and problems that we face as an industry

380
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:32,160
and there is a quote by alan bem and

381
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,240
he's a professor and an expert in

382
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,720
australia's security environment

383
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,959
now he just published a book and this

384
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,880
quote stuck with me

385
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,839
australia uses

386
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,560
conventional thinking to solve

387
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,160
non-conventional problems

388
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,160
as an industry we don't want to be

389
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,440
complacent

390
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,839
we need to adapt

391
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,160
we need to leave our egos at the door

392
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,440
and work as a team now again this is

393
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,279
part of a robust defendable adaptable

394
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,480
cyber security strategy that utilizes

395
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,800
something first nations people call the

396
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,040
village mentality

397
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,560
now this concept of the village

398
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,399
mentality links to autonomous regard

399
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,079
when we talk about first nations

400
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,839
philosophy

401
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,839
we are talking about the oldest living

402
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,800
continuous culture in the world

403
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,959
there has been a socio-political order

404
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,360
in place for the past 65 000 years

405
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,759
now throughout that time

406
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,920
the value of relationships have been

407
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,440
paramount

408
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,839
and we respect the sovereignty and the

409
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,000
rights of others and we treat all with

410
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,600
respect

411
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,920
we manage the diversity

412
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,839
between cultures and any conflicts and

413
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,079
tensions that have previously occurred

414
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,519
and just because somebody has done

415
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,600
something wrong in the past doesn't mean

416
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,959
that we hold a grudge against them

417
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,120
forever

418
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,279
now we respect one another

419
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,800
because that is the village mentality

420
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,120
we all have a role to play in this world

421
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,120
and we respect that

422
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,360
we come together as a whole

423
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,880
when we fish in the torres strait for

424
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,519
example you fish knowing that either you

425
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,880
all eat

426
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,120
or none of you eat including yourself if

427
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,279
you don't catch enough because that is

428
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,480
what i mean by autonomous regards

429
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,920
now

430
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,600
what's the outcome here

431
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,800
you weigh and you scale all factors in a

432
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,959
situation

433
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,800
now if we look towards what autonomous

434
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,440
regard means in cyber security

435
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,920
well it means that australia's digital

436
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,920
autonomy suggests that we have a

437
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,680
responsibility over regional

438
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,680
partnerships

439
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,440
we have to consider

440
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,320
our role as an industry in the bigger

441
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,880
picture of the ecosystem

442
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,959
we have to manage our relations with

443
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:55,920
governments across the world

444
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,240
to ensure that these policy areas that i

445
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,279
mentioned earlier can all operate at the

446
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,120
optimal efficiency that they're meant to

447
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,280
in their ecosystem so that they can do

448
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,839
their part

449
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:10,640
now there's an inherent entanglement

450
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,880
for good or for bad

451
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,400
between cyber and non-cyber strategies

452
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,959
which causes complexities that we all

453
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,919
have to deal with

454
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,720
so what's the link here then

455
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,640
well as people in the cyber security

456
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,760
industry

457
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,160
we need to consider the interests of our

458
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,480
international partners

459
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,480
and act with dignity

460
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,320
and respect

461
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,320
now let's harness the knowledge of

462
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,160
people who have been doing it for the

463
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,840
past 65 000 years

464
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,760
aboriginal and torres strait islander

465
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,360
peoples

466
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,200
now this can assist in managing

467
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,880
conflicts that arise between our

468
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,640
regional partners

469
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,880
it can prevent over-complication

470
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,520
and international tensions and there is

471
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,360
actually a need for this

472
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,160
the whitlam institute in 2020

473
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,240
found that pacific islanders feel left

474
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,080
out of australia's reconciliation

475
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,600
movement

476
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,679
and what people may not know

477
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,160
is that first nations australians

478
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,480
and pacific islanders share a very

479
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:17,280
similar history from colonisation

480
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,080
through

481
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,320
through to traditional ways of living

482
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,240
and cultural values

483
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,760
especially with how we live in the

484
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,760
torres strait in our value of the

485
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,160
village mentality and learning through

486
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,400
yarning and storytelling

487
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,200
now

488
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,840
the whitlam institute

489
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,520
found that pacific islanders are

490
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,679
saddened by the absence of first nations

491
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,840
australians when we engage with one

492
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,120
another the study also found that

493
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,120
australia has persistently failed to

494
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,760
address barriers to reconciliation with

495
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,080
its own people and that has stopped the

496
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,880
ability for a strong and respectful

497
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,200
relationship with people in the pacific

498
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,720
islands

499
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,760
now if we conducted a cyber engagement

500
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,400
in the pacific islands in that case it

501
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,120
would be imperative that we harness and

502
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,760
include the knowledge of aboriginal and

503
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,400
torres strait islander people

504
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,960
why because this perspective that first

505
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,280
nations people can bring to the table

506
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,679
would show an increased level of respect

507
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,919
and a strong value of the relationship

508
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,880
now this links to the bigger concept of

509
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,000
ethical and moral wisdom

510
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,039
in first nations philosophy

511
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,039
it means that the individual

512
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,120
holds the ability to predict the impacts

513
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,760
of a threat before it occurs

514
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,280
there is a focus on the need for

515
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,840
collaboration between communities to

516
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,559
ensure you abide by cultural morals

517
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,880
and ethics passed down from generation

518
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,200
to generation

519
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,160
there is mutual obligations to everybody

520
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,240
in the village

521
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,919
now that builds

522
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:57,360
respect

523
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,480
honesty

524
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,160
and trust

525
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,799
that is the outcome we need

526
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:03,840
now

527
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,840
in cyber

528
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,200
security i think it's fair to say that

529
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,000
we as an industry the ethical lines are

530
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,400
inherently blurred

531
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,159
now you may have seen that australia

532
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,919
recently made a promise to make the

533
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,720
internet a more democratic space

534
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,520
now a report by aspin just prior to this

535
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,480
promise

536
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,320
stated that there is simply too much

537
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,799
risk to allow cyberspace to become a

538
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,320
lawless world

539
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,720
and we need to continue to work together

540
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,520
to identify the rules of the road

541
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,760
in how international law applies to

542
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,480
state behaviour inside a space

543
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,640
just as it does to activities in other

544
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,919
domains

545
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,360
now remove the jargon from that

546
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,640
statement

547
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,440
that is ethical and moral wisdom

548
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,559
cyber

549
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,960
needs to work together as a team

550
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,360
adopt the village mentality

551
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,799
think smarter and not harder and enable

552
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,480
good management

553
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,039
and if we heed their ethical and moral

554
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,760
wisdom then as an industry

555
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,080
we have a better chance of acting with

556
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,280
integrity and fighting the bad guys

557
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,960
now you may be thinking

558
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,200
what's the link here

559
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,280
well

560
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,600
it creates a nuance of analysis to

561
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,679
define cyber threats

562
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,080
it challenges traditional concepts that

563
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,240
have dominated cyber security for too

564
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,440
long

565
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,440
and if you apply ethical and moral

566
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,400
wisdom

567
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,640
of first nations people then you can

568
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,080
strengthen australia's regional

569
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,480
partnerships and ensure that you act

570
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,480
ethically and morally

571
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,919
and it would enable consistent

572
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,679
reflection from differing cultural

573
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:43,840
perspectives so that we can better

574
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,360
handle the threats that are coming our

575
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,640
way

576
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,320
and i think it's fair to say that we as

577
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,679
an industry

578
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,559
we are a relatively new space

579
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:55,200
and we are still finding our way

580
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
now to help us on that journey

581
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,159
we can harness ethical and moral wisdom

582
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,559
of first nations australians

583
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,840
to help us

584
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,720
understand our position as an industry

585
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,080
in the world

586
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,000
and in what i've previously referred to

587
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,400
as that ecosystem

588
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,240
now what do we call all of this

589
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,919
quite simply situational awareness

590
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,400
situational awareness is simply being

591
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,440
aware

592
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,760
about what is happening around us

593
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,159
and being prepared

594
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,360
situational awareness is a choice

595
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,120
we have to make the choice as

596
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,559
professionals

597
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,880
in this industry on whether we are

598
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,360
situationally aware of what is happening

599
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,440
around us

600
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,520
now if you use situational awareness

601
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,559
right

602
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,559
then you can predict the consequences of

603
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,679
a situation before it even happens

604
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,840
now i'm not saying that situational

605
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,280
awareness is going to prevent the

606
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,200
situation from happening

607
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,240
however

608
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,200
it can give us as an industry

609
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,520
a more sense of control to overcome the

610
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,600
setbacks that we face

611
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:06,799
and move forward quickly

612
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,440
utilizing situational awareness means

613
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,039
that we can adapt

614
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,039
take into consideration all factors of a

615
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:13,919
threat

616
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,880
and thus have a robust defendable

617
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:21,360
executable cyber security strategy

618
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,440
now you might be thinking that this is

619
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,360
really out of the left field

620
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,919
but let me reassure you today there is

621
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,240
precedent for this

622
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,880
the adf our australian defense force has

623
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,320
multiple

624
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,880
regional force surveillance units and

625
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,559
they these have been in operation for

626
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,320
the past 40 years

627
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,720
now one of those units is a unit called

628
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,159
nor force

629
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,400
now nor force has been in operation

630
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,720
since world war one

631
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,360
they have over 60 indigenous australians

632
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,960
that make up the team

633
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,760
and they utilize their unique knowledge

634
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,080
and intimate knowledge of the land to

635
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,880
conduct reconnaissance observation and

636
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,200
collection to help advance australia's

637
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,600
national interests and stop threats

638
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,320
that is the value that first nations

639
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,320
people can bring to the table

640
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,720
now if the adf has been using it then

641
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,640
what's stopping us as an industry from

642
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,400
using it especially when we face

643
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,799
geopolitical threats too

644
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,039
and i would like to point to the picture

645
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,559
and the fact that there's two people

646
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:26,960
there holding hands casually

647
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,880
now

648
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:31,200
that is autonomous regard

649
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
a value for each other

650
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,760
and respect

651
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,679
that is the village mentality

652
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,279
now

653
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:42,960
when i throw up a slide of the middle

654
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,679
east i think we can all agree

655
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,880
that it's a hotbed of volatility

656
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,440
and ethical tensions

657
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,080
now for rightly or wrongly the 18

658
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,919
countries on this map

659
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,600
all use their intimate knowledge of

660
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,000
their own land to protect their own

661
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,760
interests

662
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,279
cultural wisdom

663
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,760
and philosophy

664
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,760
now this cultural wisdom

665
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,760
at its most basic form

666
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,679
could be expressed in one's knowledge of

667
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:13,440
the terrain

668
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,000
to use and defend itself in an act of

669
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,799
war

670
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,000
again

671
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,919
for rightly or wrongly

672
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,159
if the middle east is doing it

673
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,480
then why can't we use this knowledge as

674
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,320
the oldest living continuous culture in

675
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,799
the world for the right reasons and to

676
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,360
help us

677
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,039
now with all of this being said

678
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,360
i really want to provide the change

679
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,720
makers and the people that want to make

680
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,559
a difference in this room

681
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,400
with some key practical points to

682
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,520
consider

683
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,960
you might be wondering how can we

684
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,559
actually go about then fostering

685
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,799
diversity and talent

686
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,000
well

687
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
here's my thoughts on that

688
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,120
now

689
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,799
i was in a position

690
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,679
not long ago not five months ago

691
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:58,720
where

692
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,120
i was in regional queensland and finding

693
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,120
a job was increasingly difficult because

694
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,000
it was

695
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,200
mandating that i work in person

696
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,279
so i want to encourage

697
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,520
people that can make the difference to

698
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,360
offer more remote work positions and i'm

699
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,120
not just talking about internships or

700
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,200
grad programs i'm talking about

701
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,120
full-time work

702
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,440
we are in an industry where we can work

703
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,640
remote so let's foster that more why

704
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,480
because it covers off a big part of the

705
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,039
regional barrier that currently exists

706
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,400
for first nations people

707
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,559
i would also encourage you to consider

708
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,480
identified role hiring

709
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,799
it is legislated under the government

710
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,120
you can use identified role hiring to

711
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,640
hire aboriginal and torres strait

712
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,320
islander people

713
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,559
again it covers off a big part of the

714
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,399
barrier that is currently in place

715
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,120
i would also encourage you to consider

716
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,400
fund cert funding certification

717
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,279
now

718
00:26:57,279 --> 00:26:58,640
personally

719
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,640
i would rather hire a person because i

720
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,000
can look at them and think you're a

721
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
bloody hard worker and you might not

722
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,679
have a qualification or certification

723
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,760
but i'll put the money towards that

724
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,360
because you'll be a better return on

725
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,200
investment than a person who already has

726
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,559
the qualification but is not passionate

727
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,960
that is an investment in community

728
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,240
and it's an asset to the company

729
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,240
i would also encourage you

730
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,200
to

731
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,960
think about reconciliation action plans

732
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,120
you can implement that and ensure that

733
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,840
your organization can make differences

734
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,320
now a reconciliation action plan might

735
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,520
not be best for your organization

736
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,200
look at other options to measure your

737
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,120
success and your change in that area

738
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,039
then

739
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,799
now this one

740
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,559
is a beast of its own and quite frankly

741
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,480
a whole topic of its own

742
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,399
but we need to change the narrative of

743
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,320
cyber roles

744
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,200
and a report by the united nations

745
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,440
found that our industry is inherently

746
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,120
masculine and we use masculine terms

747
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,840
now that impacts the ability to retain

748
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,720
staff who do not identify as male

749
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,159
and it doesn't help when there's a

750
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,720
preconceived idea out there that all

751
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,120
people who work in cyber security wear

752
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,640
hoodies and sit behind a computer all

753
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,679
day and hack it doesn't really help

754
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,679
it also doesn't help when the terms we

755
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,000
use are brute force attack social

756
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,159
engineering just to name two

757
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:25,760
now i'm not saying we're going to flick

758
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,360
a switch and it's all going to change

759
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,480
tomorrow

760
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,320
but what i am saying is that we need to

761
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,200
be mindful in how we use these terms and

762
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,080
the changes even the simple ones that we

763
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,760
can make day in and day out

764
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,360
now

765
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,279
this last one it's going to seem a bit

766
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,679
out there and i'm not a technical person

767
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:47,760
i'm not claiming to be i'll leave that

768
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,520
to the technical people in the room

769
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,720
however

770
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,679
first nations linguists i firmly believe

771
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,679
can be hired for coding

772
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,919
why because there are aboriginal kids

773
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,840
out there who know eight different

774
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,960
languages

775
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,600
eight and i can barely speak english

776
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,799
but

777
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,279
their ability to learn

778
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:10,000
adapt and retain so many different

779
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,120
languages is an indication that they can

780
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,480
learn and adapt quickly to coding

781
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,399
this would be an asset to our industry

782
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,120
and to provide one final example for

783
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,640
today

784
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,679
the navajo code talkers in the second

785
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:31,200
world war were native american coders

786
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,520
they operated in the pacific islands and

787
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,679
in papua new guinea and sent coded

788
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:36,880
messages

789
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,679
that the japanese could not decipher

790
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:42,240
why couldn't the japanese decipher

791
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,159
because they were in first nations

792
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,440
languages

793
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,720
now if that was in english would have

794
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,640
took them three seconds

795
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,399
but they didn't understand the terms

796
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:51,919
that were being used

797
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,799
by the navajo code talkers

798
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,360
now this was so effective that the u.s

799
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,000
government kept this operation a secret

800
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,640
up until the 1970s because they wanted

801
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,000
to use it again in future wars

802
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,480
now if the us government could do it in

803
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,000
world war ii

804
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,240
then what is to stop us now

805
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,880
harnessing that skill and that knowledge

806
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,399
in the cyber security industry

807
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,919
so

808
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,440
as we come to the end of today's

809
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,399
discussion

810
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,840
i hope i've left you with some key

811
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,919
points for consideration

812
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,840
but if there's one thought that i'd

813
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,840
really like to leave you with

814
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,960
it's that the skills and the

815
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,440
qualifications they can be taught

816
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,600
technology can be taught

817
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,480
but we need to invest in people of all

818
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,880
different backgrounds and skill sets so

819
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,720
that we can become stronger as an

820
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,279
industry and gain new perspectives on

821
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,919
emerging threats

822
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,279
to be bold we need to think bold

823
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,039
now thank you for your time i believe

824
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,960
there's time for questions um you've

825
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,880
been a great audience

826
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,020
so i'd like to open the floor

827
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:07,760
[Applause]

828
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,360
uh questions anyone hands up

829
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,360
yes

830
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,919
um thank you amazing presentation really

831
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,720
really really loved it um

832
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,880
my question is around

833
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:33,360
how can i increase my network to include

834
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,679
more first nations people so that when

835
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:37,840
i'm looking to hire or

836
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,080
i get lots of jobs thrown my way and i'm

837
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,559
big in the diversity particularly with

838
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,279
women in cyber security but my network

839
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,679
definitely lacks diversity and cultural

840
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,360
background is there anything you could

841
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,039
suggest to

842
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:52,240
increase

843
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,880
um i guess the pull of people that i'm

844
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,200
exposing myself to and potentially could

845
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,399
bring in

846
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,760
new candidates

847
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,760
yeah that's a really good question uh

848
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,039
thank you for that

849
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,320
i think

850
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,840
and i i was one of the people that was

851
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,799
desperately looking for jobs um

852
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:09,600
and

853
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,919
to me we had like i went to bond

854
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,799
university we had a lot of people and

855
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,799
employers come up to us and give us

856
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,279
career advisory sessions and that was

857
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:20,960
really good because that was connections

858
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,720
that were sustainable

859
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,200
and it taught us something as students

860
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,440
and it also enabled us to maintain that

861
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,279
for the future when you had new job

862
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,880
opportunities pop up

863
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,399
and you know you could keep us in your

864
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,559
mind

865
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,399
in terms of cyber security i think

866
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:37,919
there's a lot of great companies out

867
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,080
there who know first nations people

868
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,399
that's how i ended up getting hired by

869
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:43,919
trustwave

870
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,519
i literally put the feelers out there to

871
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,679
bait him solutions and i had a contract

872
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,039
within a week and i'm not saying that's

873
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,440
going to be every everybody's example

874
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,600
but it's an example of a company with

875
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,080
good intentions who will make the change

876
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,480
and enable that connection and will

877
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,000
foster that so

878
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,399
they can put you in contact with people

879
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:05,679
that will be of asset to your company

880
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,320
yeah thank you

881
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,840
anyone else

882
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,159
um

883
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,240
okay i'm trying to figure out how i

884
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,840
properly

885
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:27,519
this but um while you were talking i

886
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:28,960
had sort of an idea about autonomous

887
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,360
regard and how that impacts our trust

888
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,640
models

889
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:36,159
and how that community defense concept

890
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,559
could impact how

891
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,519
we as a community share information and

892
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,960
share like

893
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:43,919
um

894
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,679
indicators of compromise and and things

895
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:47,679
so so going a little bit a little bit

896
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,600
more technical and maybe this is outside

897
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,919
of where you're focusing at the moment

898
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:54,080
but just

899
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,679
i mean as a

900
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,000
as an alternative model to like the

901
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
um immune system model that that we're

902
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,919
sort of moving more towards in

903
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,960
in security

904
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,879
yeah that's a really good question um

905
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,800
i'm just gonna say

906
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,560
i don't know technology very well like

907
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,239
that um

908
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,040
so

909
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,040
i'm happy to maybe think about that a

910
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,560
little bit more and get back to you and

911
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,719
we can talk offline

912
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,079
i'm sure there might be other people in

913
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,520
the room that have a better idea of how

914
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,199
all of that works

915
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,079
um yeah sorry

916
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,480
thank you

917
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,760
i'll own it i don't know

918
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,960
anybody else

919
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,599
yeah sure

920
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,480
by the way that was just spectacular and

921
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,359
um

922
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:47,760
so much of what you said i've noticed is

923
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,679
lacking in in our industry

924
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,280
um

925
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:55,119
um have have you seen um organizations

926
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,079
implement models or frameworks that that

927
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,800
map to in any of the the the wisdom and

928
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,119
philosophy that you've been sharing

929
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,440
um

930
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,079
well

931
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,119
so in the context of my speech um it was

932
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,359
for the term in digital revolution was

933
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:16,800
first termed that in 2010 um and that

934
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,200
was an entire book on the value of

935
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,040
indigenous people and in the

936
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,720
technological revolution and the

937
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,759
implications of that

938
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,079
apart from that i've seen some stuff

939
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,400
from aspe talk about how it can be used

940
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,240
in terms of digital sovereignty like in

941
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,079
a defense perspective

942
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,800
i haven't seen i mean i'm assuming baton

943
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,359
solutions does quite a bit of the value

944
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,359
of cultural philosophy and how that can

945
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:44,160
translate over to cyber security but i

946
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,359
haven't seen

947
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,480
me personally any concrete frameworks

948
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,240
that have touched on it so

949
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,640
this is quite revolutionary for the

950
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,440
industry to be talking about it again 10

951
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,560
12 years later with a different lens um

952
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,560
and again as part of a bigger aspect of

953
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,320
national security strategies like this

954
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,240
would just be a chapter in my book if

955
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,920
when i get to that point

956
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,040
um

957
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,880
and again that's that's an original

958
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,359
concept so we we see it talked a little

959
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:12,960
bit more about in

960
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,640
canada for example

961
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,720
but not in an australian context which

962
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,400
is really important for the current

963
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,720
security challenges that we face

964
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,079
um

965
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,599
yeah but it's important and that's an

966
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,200
issue right because we don't have those

967
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,680
frameworks in place so we need to start

968
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,520
looking at that and how we can analyze

969
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,119
that more and implement that at a

970
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,560
government level and in the private

971
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,320
sector

972
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,079
does that answer

973
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:36,880
yeah

974
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,599
[Music]

975
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,000
i hadn't heard before that only one out

976
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,240
of four um

977
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,000
first nations homes have internet i

978
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,520
think that's shocking

979
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,720
um

980
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,880
can you give us any insight into what

981
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,320
might be changing there or if there's

982
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,400
any progress or

983
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,520
areas that

984
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,680
people in this room could contribute to

985
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,359
to to make a difference and an impact

986
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:01,520
there

987
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:05,359
yeah it's a really good question

988
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:08,800
we see i see anyway pieces of news come

989
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,839
out about

990
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,440
new things that are being provided to

991
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,760
indigenous communities to help them

992
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,359
learn about cyber security or have

993
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,760
access like base level access to the

994
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,800
internet

995
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,119
um i know batum solutions has a bunch of

996
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,960
stuff going on in that area that i'm not

997
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,960
across so they might have some more

998
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,400
knowledge about what other people are

999
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,079
doing and what they are doing but to me

1000
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,359
one of the things that i really want to

1001
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,079
advocate for is cyber security awareness

1002
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,720
training for mob for community

1003
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,599
and

1004
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:40,160
i think it is far more effective to use

1005
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,960
cultural storytelling and yarning

1006
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,560
to get the point of cyber security

1007
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,560
awareness training across than having a

1008
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,440
70 page powerpoint and you talk to them

1009
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,400
i think that

1010
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,760
to me and that's something that i'm

1011
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,280
starting to implement now it's those

1012
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,720
little things

1013
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,520
of how you can help get a message across

1014
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,760
without using traditional western

1015
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,000
concepts that have dominated for far too

1016
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,680
long

1017
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,839
so that's not exactly the direct answer

1018
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:07,680
to your question but i hope that

1019
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,760
provides something

1020
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,000
thank you

1021
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,079
thank you i'll echo the other

1022
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,320
questioners and say that was a very very

1023
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,240
impressive presentation

1024
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,520
look forward to being in the main hall

1025
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,759
next year

1026
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,000
oh well done it's a hard job you did a

1027
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,079
really good job my question is uh until

1028
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,520
your book comes out

1029
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,680
um

1030
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,960
where can we where can i go and read

1031
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,400
what should i be reading

1032
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,040
to go on next level um to learn more

1033
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,560
bloody good question

1034
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,400
um so i personally love aspie there's an

1035
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,599
author there

1036
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,680
dr human curtis who has been working a

1037
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,119
lot in this space

1038
00:38:55,119 --> 00:38:56,960
i've helped he's helped me with this

1039
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,200
speech and he focuses on

1040
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,440
retaining indigenous talent and in fact

1041
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,560
i think

1042
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,400
there was just an 80 page report he

1043
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,839
released about

1044
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,079
hiring indigenous people in the adf and

1045
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,839
the reason we need to do that and how to

1046
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,839
build respect through doing that so

1047
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:13,680
that's a really great

1048
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,440
report that was just released i think

1049
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:17,280
last week

1050
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,200
apart from that the national security

1051
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,599
college has a few podcasts that talk

1052
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:22,480
about

1053
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:24,560
changing changing the pale male and

1054
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,440
stale concept of security and that again

1055
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,040
is really important

1056
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,200
um so that's a great podcast to listen

1057
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,560
to

1058
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,560
without being controversial

1059
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,160
and

1060
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,400
apart from that i think

1061
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,160
there's a lot of connections i think

1062
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:41,119
it's

1063
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:43,359
it's more verbal that we talk about it

1064
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,200
yeah i don't see much being written at

1065
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,400
the moment

1066
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,560
apart from human curtis so

1067
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,200
talking to people in cyber security you

1068
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,160
know

1069
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,599
talking to batum and making that

1070
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,520
connection with baden was how i ended up

1071
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,280
getting into cyber security in the first

1072
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,560
place

1073
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,079
so that's a really good start in my

1074
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,160
opinion having the conversation and

1075
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:03,599
that's all this speech was meant to do

1076
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:05,520
it was to be a sounding board to get the

1077
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,079
discussion started so i hope i hope that

1078
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,440
has happened today

1079
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,200

1080
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,880
