2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,040
all right welcome back everyone everyone

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,440
slowly making their way in

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,759
hope everyone enjoyed lunch

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,120
i know i indulged in the ice cream a

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,880
little too much so

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,680
future luke is going to pay for that

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,000
all right next up we have in kennedy so

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,039
he's going to be talking about a

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,279
practical approach to implementing the

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,240
acsc's strategies to mitigate cyber

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,359
security incidents using risk management

13
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:34,880
ian is ian is a cisp and a cisp and has

14
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,360
been working in cyber security for over

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,360
25 years with experience ranging from

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,320
security product evaluations consulting

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,399
policy development risk management

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,039
through to his current role as a risk

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,960
and security architect for greater

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,840
western water can we give a very warm uh

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,680
welcome to mr

22
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,559
ian kennedy thank you

23
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,160
thanks thanks guys um

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,840
okay first a little bit of background

25
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,920
about greater western water

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,159
uh because i find it useful for when i

27
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,880
uh when you think about this we've got

28
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,680
about a thousand employees we're tall

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,880
intensive purposes a water retailer

30
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,360
with some uh in the

31
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,159
melbourne region got some got a scatter

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,439
environment as well as a

33
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,360
as well as our corporate environment

34
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,360
which we've managed to separate so that

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,640
just gives you a bit of feel for where

36
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,360
i'm coming from

37
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,280
here's a

38
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,040
so why did i go through all this and

39
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,479
what was my considerations when i did it

40
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,759
now

41
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:46,479
our board

42
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,920
we're blessed and i'm bloody cursed

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,720
because our board is very interested in

44
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,840
cyber security

45
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,640
and they get frequent presentations

46
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,280
on things like the nist csf

47
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,560
the the acsc ism and these strategies

48
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,799
and vpdss

49
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:07,680
so

50
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,119
the problem that you get when you're

51
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,959
doing security is you're getting

52
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,959
all of these different

53
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,319
things and they say where do we complain

54
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,239
in this one where do we com you know and

55
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,319
you sort of go geez i don't have time

56
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,599
for all of this

57
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,200
and

58
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,000
so

59
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,680
so that was that was actually a pretty

60
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,840
big driver because where they do these

61
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,680
and i needed to know how to answer their

62
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,000
questions or i needed a way to have that

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,040
questions

64
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,879
at the answers

65
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,040
handy i won't say at the tip of my

66
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,160
fingers because i never are

67
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,440
but i also had to be practical pragmatic

68
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,560
and real

69
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,040
about it

70
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,200
i'm going to say that one again

71
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,879
practical pragmatic and real

72
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,319
i've been doing

73
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,720
risk for

74
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,959
eight

75
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,640
probably 13 or 14 years

76
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,640
and

77
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,000
over that time

78
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,800
i've learned a hell of a lot i heard a

79
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,599
um a risk officer

80
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,239
in a financial institution one time said

81
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,239
the board either spoke to me and said

82
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,840
look either risk

83
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,200
is a

84
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:22,239
very complicated issue that sounds

85
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:23,760
simple

86
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,720
or it's a simple

87
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:29,200
concept that people makes

88
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,400
make com

89
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,319
make sound complicated to be quite

90
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,720
honest i think it's the former

91
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,159
it's a really really complicated

92
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,079
thing because there's so many variables

93
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,080
and that turns into

94
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,680
you know that comes into the next one as

95
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,239
i had to find a way to manage the risk

96
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,560
of this what can be a very complicated

97
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,000
subject and you'll see where i'm coming

98
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,959
from when we get to it

99
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,480
had to be able to integrate with our

100
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,640
corporate risk management

101
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,200
framework

102
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,200
funnily enough not many people do that

103
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,120
or that hasn't been my experience

104
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,959
they'll say this is a high risk or it's

105
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:15,840
a critical impact

106
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,160
uh no

107
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,839
because they'll just say

108
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,160
because if you ask anyone what's the

109
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,880
impact and i'll say oh it's critical

110
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,400
and you go

111
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,840
okay let's try this again

112
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,360
here's a range of things that can be you

113
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,960
know and you pick things out of the way

114
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,960
they measure risks in the corporate and

115
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,120
you say

116
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,160
this is unlike uh this is what it's a

117
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,320
minimal impact is and you actually give

118
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,160
them some examples

119
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,680
and then you give them examples all the

120
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,360
way through to

121
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,479
this is a

122
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,600
catastrophic impact

123
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,960
and then you go

124
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,160
you tell me where it fits into there

125
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,280
you never ask them just to give you a

126
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,039
name because they'll always

127
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,159
bump it up by about

128
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,479
it's catastrophic

129
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,800
happens every single time

130
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,039
you never get the project managers to

131
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,560
tell you

132
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,720
because the project managers

133
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,960
i'll tell you right now they don't care

134
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,120
about the delivered risks

135
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,600
and i'll use you know delivered risks

136
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,440
what that project

137
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,120
what the risks are that

138
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,120
the project delivers into your

139
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,680
environment the security vulnerabilities

140
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,800
uh

141
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,479
you know

142
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,000
all of those sorts of things that it

143
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,160
delivers they don't care

144
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,479
every single project i've ever seen aims

145
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:43,840
to start uh

146
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,720
solving world hunger

147
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,400
every project

148
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,199
and by the end of it

149
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,880
yeah i won't even get a steak sandwich

150
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,039
you know it's but that's just the way it

151
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,240
is

152
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,199
so

153
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,000
project managers

154
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,479
for a delivered risk forget about it

155
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,319
my cio

156
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,280
wanted to photo focus on strategies

157
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,319
that provide the best mitigation

158
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,520
you know what gives you the best bang

159
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,719
for buck quite reasonable

160
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:23,600
and what i've found over the years

161
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,520
is

162
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,160
unless you know trying

163
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,560
to conduct a risk assessment

164
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,720
against individual systems

165
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,120
it's just too damn hard

166
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,639
it really is too hard

167
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,039
you know

168
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,520
in previous lives i said ah

169
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,919
what's the risk if we don't turn this

170
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,880
do this configuration

171
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,199
and you go um

172
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,240
well

173
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,919
what about all the compensating controls

174
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,199
what about all the other controls that

175
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,759
relate to it

176
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,199
what's the risk with this particular

177
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,880
thing you go well it's a risk to the

178
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,360
business but what about all these other

179
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,280
things

180
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,119
so if you can possibly avoid it

181
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,080
don't do individual systems i don't do

182
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,319
individual systems and i don't do

183
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,479
specific configurations because

184
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,160
i've never seen it make sense

185
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,479
um

186
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:23,759
yeah

187
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,840
it's never made sense

188
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,720
we've

189
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,960
i've done this you won't see it

190
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,880
uh because it's corporate information

191
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,319
but i ended up doing

192
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,319
tall intensive purposes too

193
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,759
one for our corporate environment one

194
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,840
for our scada environment because they

195
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,720
had quite different risk profiles

196
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,800
and that's why i did it that's it

197
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,039
but i also had to be able to justify

198
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,120
everything that i said because too many

199
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,360
times from a risk perspective

200
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,479
people say

201
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,639
say things but they can never justify it

202
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,759
oh it's this is a critical

203
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,479
yeah and

204
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,879
and i'll guarantee your ceo

205
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,759
well to me it gets that boy that cried

206
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,919
wolf

207
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,440
they just get sick and tired of hearing

208
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,240
it so

209
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,800
you've got to be able to justify it

210
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,840
so

211
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,359
how did i pick the essential 8

212
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,400
and i must apologize here sort of when i

213
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,240
looked at the uh summary and when i

214
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,759
looked at the title i thought oh god i

215
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,520
thought of this essentially

216
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,159
really it's the strategies

217
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,679
that i chose

218
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,000
why

219
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,559
i've got that plus there because it's

220
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,279
a couple of others but whenever

221
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,760
a couple of other controls but whenever

222
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,640
the

223
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,200
any other control that i chose

224
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,519
i made myself justify it

225
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,920
you say to yourself do i really need

226
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,760
this or is that part of this other

227
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,160
control

228
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:02,880
so

229
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,200
the reason i chose the ac strategies

230
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,600
it's a reasonable number of controls who

231
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,399
wants to do a risk management on a

232
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,519
hundred controls

233
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,360
not me

234
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,320
doesn't make any sense

235
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,240
one of the great things

236
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,000
you know and and i'll refer to the

237
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,399
controls from the strategies as the key

238
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,680
controls

239
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,000
and we'll come a bit more of that later

240
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,680
it's got

241
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,760
defined strength

242
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,360
measurements

243
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,680
again we're coming back to this justify

244
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,160
i can justify why this is an essential

245
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,360
control

246
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,600
i can justify why this is an important

247
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,640
control

248
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,240
i can justify why i don't give a rat

249
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,200
and it's got defined measures for the

250
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,640
effectiveness of those essential

251
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,199
controls

252
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,600
and you know and this comes into this

253
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,200
management of risk

254
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,440
it's

255
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,440
it's that maturity model that they

256
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,800
provide if you do these

257
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,519
then you're mitigating this risk add

258
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,959
this you've got this control nailed

259
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,160
pity

260
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,279
i can justify it

261
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,360
then you've got guidelines

262
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,480
how to implement each strategy

263
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:24,640
which is uh and you've got that i've got

264
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,760
that document down there

265
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,720
so what's the first step

266
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,200
how do i measure these things

267
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
first of all

268
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,959
12 to 15 risks

269
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,160
12 to 15.

270
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,040
first of all if you think that you can

271
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,040
actually eliminate a risk

272
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,160
it's probably not a risk

273
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:58,160
and when you really really start

274
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,560
thinking about it you go

275
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,000
well

276
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
if it's the same controls

277
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,880
and pretty much the same impact

278
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,360
it's the same risk

279
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,440
and when you start seriously thinking

280
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,760
about it

281
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:18,640
the major ones compromise of the public

282
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,600
facing systems

283
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,560
ransomware this is that the next two are

284
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,079
interesting

285
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,399
i i hope you can read it but if not it's

286
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,560
ransomware and external adversaries who

287
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,959
destroy your corrupt data

288
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,760
okay first one is a limited number of

289
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,839
systems

290
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:42,560
or uh you know or of limited criticality

291
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,720
second one is a large number of systems

292
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,880
or a small number of critical systems

293
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,720
because the other thing i found

294
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,200
is that people get confused

295
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:56,000
they'll say oh we get um

296
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,800
we get phishing attacks all the time ah

297
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,720
and you go

298
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,000
so

299
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,399
everyone does how often do we get our

300
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,399
corporate

301
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:07,600
done

302
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,120
so it's again it's a completely

303
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,440
different risk because i have these

304
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,040
discussions

305
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,120
and it changes

306
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,079
the the impact it really does change the

307
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,399
impact

308
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,720
so okay

309
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,560
again use the corporate level risk

310
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,119
measurements

311
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,920
good all inherent risks

312
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,320
who's heard it and hates it

313
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,800
come on

314
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,600
i've always hated inherent risk until i

315
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,360
started to do this

316
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,279
because it's no controls

317
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,920
how does this how does this work again

318
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,440
but in the end

319
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,800
i had to do it

320
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,399
because it was the only way to make the

321
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,680
maths work

322
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,279
and there are mass behind this

323
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,360
so you don't consider any controls

324
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,680
determine the consequence determine the

325
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,480
likelihood and calculate it out based on

326
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,800
your corporate risk profile

327
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,639
all right

328
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,320
so we're talking about the key controls

329
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,959
do the key controls

330
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,399
mitigate the likelihood or the

331
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,240
consequence again

332
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,639
it can be either

333
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:21,519
but

334
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,320
it's

335
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,320
you know you've got to think about it

336
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,639
does this mitigate the consequence or

337
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,440
the likelihood

338
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,720
and

339
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,959
because again

340
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,880
it makes a difference to the maths

341
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,760
because you're talking about a

342
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,959
two-dimensional framework

343
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,680
you assign the controls add the

344
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,440
strengths to the controls

345
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,360
and they'll never change because

346
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,519
remember they're based on the defined

347
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,199
measures

348
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,240
within

349
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,079
the asc

350
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,079
mitigation strategies

351
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:56,399
you determine the effectiveness again

352
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,600
against the strategies

353
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,000
one thing you should notice and i

354
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,040
specifically put it up here

355
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,160
note

356
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:10,560
that it's an exponential increase

357
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,040
right so

358
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,839
fully effective is 0.95

359
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,360
um again

360
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,000
i don't want to be able to say control

361
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,360
and again this was part of the maths

362
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,440
is you cannot eliminate a risk and if

363
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,279
you say all the controls are fully

364
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,480
effective it eliminates a risk

365
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,430
pass

366
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:35,839
[Music]

367
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:36,880
and

368
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,519
again you'll see that essential

369
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:42,399
has a value of 64 instead of 32 again

370
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,079
we'll get into that and you can it

371
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,920
really does make a startling difference

372
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,240
i'm proud of this one

373
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:57,360
so then you assign the controls

374
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,920
to the applicable risks

375
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,199
many to many relationship

376
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,199
and one thing i'm going to point out

377
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,720
is this isn't

378
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,959
rocket science

379
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,480
it did my heading

380
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,760
so maybe yeah whatever um but this is

381
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,040
all done

382
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,680
in a single excel workbook with not a

383
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,638
single macro

384
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,000
so you map

385
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,160
all of your controls to the applicable

386
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,519
risks

387
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:30,320
many to many

388
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,079
and what does that give you

389
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,360
ah

390
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,680
yeah and that becomes the current risk

391
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,480
but i've also included

392
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,440
the proposed risk just to show you

393
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,560
just because what i'm saying is that if

394
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,560
all the relevant key controls of a risk

395
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,639
that you've assigned against a risk are

396
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:59,360
fully effective the risk will be minimal

397
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,759
that's the theory

398
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,440
not going to say it's perfect because it

399
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,399
ain't

400
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,079
there's no such thing as perfection in

401
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,480
risk management

402
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,399
people say is it an art or a science and

403
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,560
i said very good question you know it's

404
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,480
i just try and make it as consistent as

405
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,480
i can

406
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,240
and there's

407
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,920
in this presentation we'll be doing

408
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,839
three

409
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,199
different uh i'll be looking at three

410
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,920
different risks

411
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,959
and

412
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,480
yeah it's sort of worked out a bit funny

413
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,880
because i'm trying to illustrate things

414
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,320
so there's

415
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,560
uh the ransomware

416
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,079
of the

417
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:39,519
small number of critical systems

418
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:42,560
ransomware of limited criticality

419
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,040
and compromise of public facing systems

420
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,279
and we can argue about the about the

421
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,440
likelihood and the consequence

422
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,399
but the idea is that if a single system

423
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,079
gets done for ransomware

424
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,239
who

425
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,679
cares all right

426
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:07,839
this turned out to be quite important

427
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,119
as i map the capabilities

428
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:16,159
again many to many to the care controls

429
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,079
all of my all in my work excel workbook

430
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,000
because

431
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,839
what i found

432
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:31,720
was a mitigation initiative

433
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,120
it can affect multiple capabilities

434
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,719
it can affect multiple risks

435
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,440
it can affect multiple controls

436
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,799
so i had to map them all

437
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,600
wasn't that fun

438
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,559
so

439
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,320
then you identify and recommend the

440
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,760
mitigations

441
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,280
and assess the effectiveness of those

442
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,280
key controls

443
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,039
and the proposed risk

444
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,640
is on how the recommended mitigations

445
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,120
increase the effectiveness of the

446
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,320
control

447
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,120
remember the strength does not change

448
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,320
it's only the effectiveness

449
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,120
so

450
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,720
let's have a talk about this two

451
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,280
scenarios

452
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,120
what happens if you just change the

453
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,200
excellent controls

454
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,120
and what happens if you change the

455
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,199
effectiveness of the essential controls

456
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,880
so here's where i'm

457
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,559
where this is

458
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,480
a little bit funny because we're try uh

459
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,160
because i was trying to illustrate how

460
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,600
it works

461
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,039
you can see

462
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:38,160
that

463
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,280
in the current the essential

464
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,120
and the excellent controls i just chose

465
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,960
eight of each

466
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,120
and they've got identical

467
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,840
effectiveness

468
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,799
and then when i looked at how does the

469
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,400
essential

470
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,400
excellent control scenario affected

471
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,640
i just changed those

472
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,440
excellent ones

473
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,440
and vice versa for the essential

474
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,840
pretty

475
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,360
yeah hopefully you'll get it

476
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,159
hopefully you get it

477
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,520
so

478
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,799
again

479
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,918
here's what this looks like

480
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,480
you've got that first one with the

481
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,880
current this is the uh

482
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,960
critical systems

483
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,640
on the left excellent

484
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,039
you'll see

485
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,679
it reduces it a bit

486
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:39,679
still a significant risk

487
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,919
you do the uh essential controls what

488
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,440
happens

489
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,880
reduces it

490
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,160
a lot more

491
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,120
down to a low risk

492
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,559
okay and that you know and this is a bit

493
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,799
false because you're not going to do you

494
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,720
may not do all of those essential

495
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,160
controls let's face it they're bloody

496
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,840
hard to do

497
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,760
some of them

498
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,159
most of them but at any rate you may not

499
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,679
get them fully effective

500
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,240
but what you're trying to understand

501
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,000
is remember i was saying what gives the

502
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,559
the cio the best bang for buck

503
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,360
if you do one initiative

504
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,400
that affects multiple uh multiple risks

505
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,600
uh multiple controls

506
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,520
you know and you just do it

507
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,960
on one thing

508
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,159
mate

509
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,600
that's gold

510
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,120
you know and so you've got to be able to

511
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,840
do that

512
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,320
again

513
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,559
the second one

514
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,039
current and you can see how that really

515
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,840
reduces that risk

516
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:53,520
and the last one

517
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,559
speaks for itself you can just

518
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,760
immediately see the difference

519
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,440
so i spoke earlier

520
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,679
about how do i prioritize the controls

521
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,440
that need to be implemented

522
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,840
one of the things that this uh what i've

523
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,039
done

524
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,799
is

525
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:17,280
they're based on the sum

526
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,840
that they contribute to the mitigation

527
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,640
of the likelihood and the control

528
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,360
it's a little bit better than

529
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,960
but

530
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,120
you know it's pretty

531
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,080
let let me be quite honest the past the

532
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,520
pub test

533
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,120
i know that's a political thing my

534
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,000
apologies but when i looked at this when

535
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,200
i did this

536
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,320
for real

537
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,120
in our environment i said are these the

538
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,679
controls that i would really

539
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,440
you know what prioritization would i

540
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,400
give these controls

541
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,080
and i said yeah that's about right

542
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,640
so i was quite happy with that

543
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,640
and management buy-in comes from a

544
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,039
combination of a reduction of the risk

545
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,360
in a justifiable manner

546
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,159
and a relatively digestible approach

547
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,480
what's that what's that i hear a you've

548
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,840
got to be kidding me digestible

549
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,679
you also get steak knives

550
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,679
ah

551
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,480
before i go into the punch line

552
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,039
i'll point out that

553
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,440
the vpdsf

554
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,520
and the csf

555
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,480
i also map out

556
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,640
and if the c uh

557
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,120
and if a

558
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,320
map

559
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,400
to the

560
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,159
uh

561
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,880
to the mitigation strategies

562
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,679
and

563
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,840
because they remember their key controls

564
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,000
vp dss and the remainder of the nist

565
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,280
stuff

566
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,760
i consider them supporting controls

567
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,799
you know the strength of those

568
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,640
supporting controls

569
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,200
best practice which i hate but i hate

570
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,120
that term but best practice

571
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,480
and i note that

572
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,720
please note that the supporting controls

573
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,799
do not contribute to the direct

574
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,760
mitigation of the risk

575
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,520
i learned this one in a previous life

576
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,840
you know you have your key controls

577
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,440
which really

578
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,360
are the teeth

579
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,200
of how you mitigate a risk then you have

580
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,720
these other supporting controls which

581
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,440
although important

582
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,320
don't contribute directly

583
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,240
what the

584
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,799
okay right

585
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,320
so remember i was saying

586
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,559
digestible

587
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,240
there you go

588
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,720
on the uh and it's probably a bit too

589
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,720
far away but what you've got on the left

590
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,480
hand side

591
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,240
is the maturity of um

592
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,159
the nist

593
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:11,039
cyber security framework

594
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:11,919
all right

595
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,360
our board

596
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,799
loves it

597
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:15,760
you know

598
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,760
identify protect detect respond recover

599
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,159
they love it they can understand it

600
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:26,400
you know i will if i was to wheel out

601
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,320
the ism

602
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,559
i just get blank looks

603
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:33,200
but because i can say

604
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,919
than this csf and it's those five words

605
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,600
and i think most the board can remember

606
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,039
five words

607
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,039
they do understand it

608
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:42,640
and we can show them

609
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,559
the strength where we are now which is

610
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,799
the red and where we want to be which is

611
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,200
the green

612
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,320
right

613
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,600
in the middle

614
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,360
what are those strategies

615
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,880
what are the strategies that we're going

616
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:00,039
to do

617
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,840
and there's um

618
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,360
24

619
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,559
just canning

620
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:10,720
um 24 different strategies and again

621
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,960
you know i've sort of

622
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,480
taking out all the corporate information

623
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,520
from this

624
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,440
and

625
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,279
the prioritization which is based on

626
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,679
that sum

627
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,440
and i deliberately did it so that once

628
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,400
on the left yada yada

629
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:29,039
and again this passed the pub test in

630
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,640
the real world

631
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,400
you passed the pub test

632
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,600
um

633
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,200
because it looked about right and when i

634
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,559
took it past most of the people in the

635
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,320
organization they said yeah that looks

636
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,159
about right

637
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,640
which was i didn't have the the issue is

638
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,080
i don't want to go into these things and

639
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,720
have a bloody argument with people all

640
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,039
the time about this stuff

641
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,080
so it's got to be justifiable

642
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,640
and then on the right hand side

643
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,720
uh and this doesn't reflect those

644
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,640
examples that i give you

645
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,159
that i put up

646
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,120
you've got how the risk profiles change

647
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,159
changes if you do all those

648
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:09,279
uh mitigations

649
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,480
so

650
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,919
and that one

651
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,240
is really powerful

652
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,360
so you can see where we are

653
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,320
where we want to get to

654
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,480
what are the strategies we've got to do

655
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,080
when do we propose that we're going to

656
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,400
do it

657
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,600
and what's the end game

658
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,279
what is the anger

659
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:34,080
you're not saying you're going to

660
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,919
eliminate the risks

661
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,480
you're going to manage the risks

662
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,039
and i tell you what

663
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,400
i went to one board meeting

664
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,120
and

665
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,600
my boss said

666
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,600
and one of the members of the board says

667
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,959
we want to eliminate the risks

668
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,200
unfortunately i couldn't keep my big

669
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,760
trap shut and i said look i'm very sorry

670
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,400
but you can't

671
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,320
you can't meditate you can't eliminate a

672
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,799
risk

673
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:07,840
and

674
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,559
they looked at me in a bit bit of shock

675
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:11,840
and

676
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,360
luckily

677
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,039
i knew one of the auditors that was

678
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:16,480
there

679
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:19,120
and i said what do you think

680
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,760
and he says ian's absolutely correct you

681
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,960
can't eliminate the risk

682
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,159
thank you god

683
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,840
but i got a big kick up the ass from the

684
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,840
cio when i walked out the ball out of

685
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,760
the board meeting

686
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,520
for actually not letting them talk

687
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,520
through things and decide themselves but

688
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,600
if there's one thing i've found

689
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,880
is if

690
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,559
just a personal opinion

691
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,480
if you just let them talk they come up

692
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,000
with all sorts of ridiculous things

693
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,760
just did my head in does my head in you

694
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,799
know some of the things that people

695
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,720
agree to with the auditors

696
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,880
um the things the board dreams up and

697
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,919
just go

698
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:57,840
say what

699
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,279
and then you've got to try and implement

700
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,760
it micro segmentation

701
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,640
in a legacy environment oh my god

702
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,159
um

703
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,200
but

704
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,399
they did it

705
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,159
you know they made that decision i had

706
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,200
to

707
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,880
i had to figure out a way to do it i'm

708
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,120
not saying it's bad but

709
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,760
we had to be fairly imaginative

710
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,919
uh well we had to look at alternative

711
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,240
approaches but that's

712
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,039
that's where we were

713
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,440
so

714
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,200
how do i do this with all without too

715
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,960
much effort overhead

716
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,120
it did take a lot to set up

717
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,279
and it took me a couple of years to

718
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,760
figure out all those you know to say

719
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,200
well i'm doing this

720
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,600
yeah but then i have to do that

721
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,880
to really make sense of it and so

722
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,520
it took me a couple of years of

723
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,679
i won't say trial and error it really it

724
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,240
was that uh agile thing

725
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,320
it did a bit

726
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,480
got it working did another bit got it

727
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,679
working

728
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,120
and and

729
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,440
i wasn't afraid to make mistakes one of

730
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,120
the first things i said to my boss when

731
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,399
he uh

732
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,880
in the uh when he employed me

733
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,760
was i said in the interview i said look

734
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,080
i'm very happy to make decisions but if

735
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,799
i uh but if i do i'll make mistakes

736
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,919
you know

737
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:21,760
show me a man that hasn't uh made a

738
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,039
mistake and i'll show you someone that

739
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:27,000
hasn't made a decision

740
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:28,559
and

741
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:31,039
but now the affair the effectiveness and

742
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,399
now the effort

743
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,120
is focused on the key controls

744
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:38,239
the vpdsf

745
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:42,480
and then this csf

746
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,320
looking at the effectiveness of those

747
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,520
controls

748
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,440
and trying to understand what the

749
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,960
environment is doing uh acsc recently

750
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,080
redid

751
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,080
their maturity measurements so i went

752
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,279
back

753
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,360
and had a look at them again

754
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,640
it's a really good way to get to know

755
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,840
your entire environment when you're

756
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:03,039
doing this sort of stuff too by the way

757
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,279
so

758
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,679
oh my god i hope i'm doing all right

759
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:12,159
with time

760
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:13,760
you've got 10 minutes left

761
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,360
ah cool

762
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,880
i've done well

763
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,720
all right are there any questions in a

764
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,279
room before i jump to those who are or

765
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:22,960
may not or may be in the live stream

766
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,279
sorry

767
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,760
all right let me let me just you caught

768
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,320
me by surprise no i've had oh good i

769
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,080
might have so i've either blown your

770
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,520
brains away

771
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,240
um you thought it was all a lot of um

772
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,399
 well i got the message across

773
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:40,799
we do have a couple of the questions in

774
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:42,320
the q a section through the app so

775
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,840
everyone shots us

776
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,440
right first one

777
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:48,159
uh as a risk management practitioner why

778
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,039
wouldn't you automate or use ai

779
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,159
ml or ai or machine learning tool sets

780
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,720
to streamline and remove the tedious use

781
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,600
of excel sheets

782
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,720
money

783
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,640
but you know remember what i was saying

784
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,840
um

785
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,360
we're an organization of about a

786
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,519
thousand

787
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,480
we don't

788
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,679
you know

789
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:17,360
and every time i went to the um

790
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,279
to the developers to help me develop

791
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,919
something like this

792
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,880
you can guess what the answer was

793
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,840
we have business priorities

794
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,799
dang

795
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:29,919
so

796
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:33,840
what what tools did i have left

797
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,600
google

798
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,440
and

799
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,519
developing it in a spreadsheet like

800
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:41,440
could i have done it in a

801
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:46,240
in a database all of that yeah probably

802
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,679
actually certainly because this is what

803
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:51,919
it is really it's a relational database

804
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,519
but

805
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,360
it was remember what i was saying about

806
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,480
the sprints

807
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,000
it started out as a fairly simple

808
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,440
spreadsheet

809
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,679
then when i started learning started the

810
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:04,159
really deep thinking

811
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:06,960
about what i was trying to achieve

812
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,279
it ended up

813
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,200
getting very complicated

814
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,039
and

815
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,000
yeah if we've got any more than a couple

816
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,440
of minutes left i'll actually show you

817
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,039
the real spreadsheet

818
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,360
but um we've got a another question on

819
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,760
there yeah all right what's your best

820
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,840
way to assess likelihood and

821
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,279
consequence sorry can you repeat that

822
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,640
one

823
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,200
what's your best way to assess

824
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,320
likelihood and consequence

825
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:39,600
yeah good question

826
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,840
experience

827
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:47,519
looking at it from the corporation

828
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,200
looking at it from the organization

829
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,080
you're working with

830
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,720
from their perspective

831
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,360
not dreaming it up by us

832
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:00,559
yeah and you just force yourself you say

833
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:02,880
what would this really do

834
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,200
in the context of

835
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,880
our

836
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,960
risk framework the corporate risk

837
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,200
framework because i everyone should

838
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,799
measure

839
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,240
if it doesn't there there's something

840
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,720
wrong i should say this is a

841
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,279
insignificant risk this uh

842
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,360
insignificant impact

843
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,360
or consequence this is a catastrophic

844
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,799
consequence

845
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,200
this is the like uh you know

846
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,600
almost certain likelihood and you just

847
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,799
um

848
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,200
and have a bit of a meditation have a

849
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,000
bit of a look at it

850
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,200
based on your experience one thing i

851
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,760
will say is what i've what i have found

852
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,559
over the years is if you go to somebody

853
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,159
and say tell me what you think

854
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,880
you either get into a a three-hour

855
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,159
argument

856
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:55,279
or

857
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,279
they give you blank looks

858
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:58,880
and you don't get anything

859
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,080
what i found much more effective

860
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,440
stake in the sand

861
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,720
what do you think

862
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,559
how does that look

863
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,040
and you get a much much

864
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,399
better

865
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,040
response from people

866
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,000
and again do not let them tell you

867
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,960
oh it's almost certain

868
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,719
what does that mean

869
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:23,119
give them the ranges that you're talking

870
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,280
about give them the ranges of the

871
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,520
consequence that you're talking about

872
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,839
this is what insignificant means this is

873
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,679
what catastrophic means

874
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,918
because i'll guarantee you what it will

875
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:34,800
do

876
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,359
is it will drag them back into something

877
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:38,960
that's realistic and something that's

878
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,199
manageable

879
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,119
so so what you're saying there is

880
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:44,960
instead of saying what do you think pose

881
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,000
an opinion then go go from there yeah i

882
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,760
think people were more likely to

883
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,918
criticize or i think it was a really

884
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,159
funny tweet i saw recently it was um

885
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,399
someone posting on stack overflow with

886
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,560
questions saying how do i do this

887
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,400
and then they'll log into another

888
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,000
account and they'll give a really bad

889
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,960
answer

890
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,640
and then i get hundreds of responses of

891
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,280
people wanting to correct that person

892
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,400
pretty much

893
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,079
and um

894
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,760
yeah um

895
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,320
having a leather jacket is good um you

896
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,200
know for all the criticisms

897
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,680
uh gore-tex perhaps

898
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,040
broad shoulders

899
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,680
rubber ass that helps

900
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,960
um

901
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,200
but you've got to be prepared

902
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,480
i made a mistake

903
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,560
there's a couple more questions sure

904
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,640
would this recording and the slides be

905
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,960
made available yes i'm quite happy to

906
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,960
make the reporting slides available

907
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,640
uh the slides i

908
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,920
i can't

909
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,200
make the spreadsheet available

910
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,320
you could probably put it together

911
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,839
yourself if you looked at it and you

912
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:49,520
thought about it and it may be a bit

913
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,079
different for every organisation

914
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,040
but that idea of the exponential

915
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:00,720
effectiveness and strength

916
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,240
it still works if you just do it two

917
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,880
four six eight ten but

918
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,119
it doesn't give that really strong

919
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,240
message

920
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,560
about

921
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:16,640
how essential the essential controls are

922
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,520
any more yep there's a few more

923
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,200
questions that's done cool pour in which

924
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,240
is nice

925
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,359
uh how do you sell to a leadership team

926
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,000
who might not see the value of security

927
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,480
controls

928
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,839
okay

929
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:34,160
okay

930
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:40,640
that

931
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,640
that's how you sell it

932
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,119
that's the output

933
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,920
that is your high level

934
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,599
of what you're trying to do

935
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,000
and again practical pragmatic and

936
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,960
reasonable don't try and get and

937
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,280
absolutely minimize the risk

938
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:00,400
try and manage the risk and most risk is

939
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,119
about communicating

940
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,920
what you're doing why

941
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,320
why you can't do some stuff that's just

942
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,280
as important as why you can't do it

943
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,599
why you can why you should do it if you

944
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,480
can't do something

945
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,800
hands up this doesn't make sense to do

946
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,760
it will cost us too much money

947
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:24,640
yeah so

948
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,240
and by the way if you didn't realize

949
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,680
this ties in directly with everything

950
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,760
that was put in to that excel

951
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,960
spreadsheet

952
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,839
to my excel spreadsheet

953
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,599
and like i said i'd love to have all

954
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,520
that other stuff but

955
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,800
i didn't have the finances

956
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,400
and convincing people to invest money in

957
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,560
this sort of thing we couldn't afford

958
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,560
one of these big grc

959
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,880
things

960
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,880
and to be quite honest they didn't do

961
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,000
what i wanted to do

962
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,560
i've got another one here

963
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,280
could you talk about how and how often

964
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,599
you measured the effectiveness slash

965
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,160
maturity yeah of the security controls

966
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,359
to feed back into the current status

967
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:14,240
view

968
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,079
yeah yeah yep

969
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,839
because it's at the st well

970
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,520
elt

971
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:26,880
this gets presented to every 12 months

972
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,400
it also gets

973
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,119
so that's once

974
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,040
when a project finishes

975
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,920
or initiative finishes

976
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,560
that's another time and i also run my

977
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,200
eye over it

978
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,839
every time i talk to an auditor

979
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,920
because the auditors

980
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,520
they love the they love this sort of

981
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,280
stuff because it ties into the

982
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:53,520
effectiveness of the controls so you end

983
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,599
up doing it really often but i i do make

984
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:57,599
a point of doing it every every couple

985
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,599
of months or when uh

986
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,480
when initiative completes um for those

987
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,160
of you that have dealt with auditors i'm

988
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,760
sure you'll know what i mean i've got

989
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,760
calluses here

990
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,560
yeah

991
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,800
next one

992
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:13,440
uh that looks like it online we got one

993
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,040
more minute for a quick question in the

994
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,320
audience

995
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,079
okay if anyone wants to have a look at

996
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,599
the spreadsheet come

997
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,000
talk to me afterwards and i'll give you

998
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,720
a quick look at it so that you can

999
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,240
see it

1000
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,560
