1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,680
okay good morning and welcome to this

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,160
next session at ulcer 2022 day two my

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,760
name is valdemar jacobson from business

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:10,880
aspect and i'm your chair for this

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,759
session

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,320
um this session is by jamie zajac from

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,320
recorded future talking about five ways

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,359
to optimize your sock

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,800
all right thank you very much

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,760
all right

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,119
just a quick reminder there are two

12
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,039
extra seats up here so if anyone wanted

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,560
to take these they're comfortable

14
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,160
they're available but that's up to you

15
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,079
of your choice uh so good morning jamie

16
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,440
zajac nice to meet you all i am from

17
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:35,040
recorded future i run product management

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,640
there uh but today i'm not talking about

19
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,840
recorded future i'm just going to talk

20
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,520
more generally about

21
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,920
five ways to optimize your stock

22
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,280
so first i'd like to start with what is

23
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,640
the problem that we're actually trying

24
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,360
to to solve by having a stock in in

25
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,559
general

26
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,600
uh

27
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,879
and the thing is that what's happening

28
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:52,559
is uh cyber security is becoming more

29
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,320
and more of a requirement for every

30
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,480
company uh gartner estimates that in the

31
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,199
next couple of years 40 of companies

32
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,039
publicly traded companies are going to

33
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,719
have a dedicated cyber security

34
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,799
committee at the board level so there's

35
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,720
a lot of money pouring into security a

36
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,400
lot of awareness pouring in for

37
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,400
companies saying right i have to do

38
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,400
something about this this is a threat to

39
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,159
my business this is a real problem

40
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,840
something i have to actually deal with

41
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,439
so that's good for us as cyber security

42
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,280
professionals because the business is

43
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,520
finally starting to realize uh what we

44
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,680
do is important what we do is essential

45
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,280
but it also puts a lot of pressure on us

46
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,119
that we're now you know given these

47
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,560
these really high expectations i want

48
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,960
you to protect me from everything i want

49
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,799
you to keep my business running these

50
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:34,720
really lofty ambitious goals that cyber

51
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,520
security professionals are now handed

52
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,560
so you know there's more and more

53
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,759
pressure being put on the team there's

54
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,040
more and more more need that we need to

55
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,079
deliver

56
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:43,119
i like to look at what we're trying to

57
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,200
do in cyber security i use the analogy

58
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,920
of driving if we think about driving

59
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,000
it's an inherently dangerous task right

60
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,320
we're in these these small vehicles that

61
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,079
although they're designed to be safe

62
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,159
they're really susceptible to uh a

63
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,360
pothole in the

64
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,680
road some rocks uh to something

65
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,040
something happening

66
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,399
you know when we're driving we're going

67
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,399
down the motorway at you know what 100

68
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:06,719
110 150 depending on your speed of

69
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,160
choice you know kilometers per hour

70
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,318
we're going really fast just a few feet

71
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,680
apart from other vehicles that are doing

72
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,280
the same thing

73
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,560
everyone on the road has a different

74
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,319
priority some people are just trying to

75
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,000
look cool in their car some people are

76
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,440
trying to get somewhere really fast some

77
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,520
people are trying to take in the view

78
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,200
we all have different priorities

79
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,000
uh

80
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,520
we all have different ways that we're

81
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,879
trying to get there so it's a it's a

82
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,239
challenging dangerous environment to

83
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,040
drive

84
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,640
and there's no one solution to make

85
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,560
driving safe right there's you can't

86
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,400
just simply drive slower right on the

87
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
motorway it's actually more dangerous to

88
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,000
drive slowly than it is to drive at the

89
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,519
speed of traffic

90
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,280
you you can't simply put your car on

91
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,879
autopilot right there's been numerous

92
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,720
accidents that have happened by that

93
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,160
there's no one tool just wearing your

94
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,599
seat belt won't protect you just buying

95
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,519
a safer car won't protect you there's no

96
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,440
silver bullet

97
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,840
so you know how do we make driving safer

98
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,480
right we all do this every day well we

99
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,159
we maintain situational awareness we

100
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,440
know what's around us when we're driving

101
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,120
who's the car trying to pass us you know

102
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,280
coming by uh where's the exit that we're

103
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,360
trying to get to

104
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,879
second we make a plan we know where

105
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,400
we're going to get to what exit do i

106
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,840
need to take what lane do i need to be

107
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,519
in to get there so we make a plan we try

108
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,280
to follow that plan

109
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,959
and then finally we we understand that

110
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:16,640
no matter how good of a plan we make for

111
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,400
our driving we have to adapt and

112
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,800
overcome when all of a sudden a car cuts

113
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,360
you off when perhaps an animal is in the

114
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,440
road or perhaps you get a notification

115
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,879
that there's a police officer ahead

116
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,200
running radar you need to slow down we

117
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,840
quickly adapt and overcome to the

118
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,640
environment it's really the same in

119
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,560
cyber security there's no one silver

120
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,400
bullet solution that we can implement or

121
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,080
buy that it's going to protect us from

122
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,200
everything

123
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,959
we have to build a plan

124
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,799
we have to try to align priorities in an

125
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:43,920
environment where everyone has a

126
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,040
different goal that they're trying to

127
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,280
accomplish and no matter what we plan

128
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,000
for

129
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,599
something changes either the threat

130
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,440
landscape changes something gets in our

131
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,879
environment so we have to adapt and

132
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:53,840
overcome

133
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,200
so i use the analogy of driving to

134
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,400
represent cyber security and to

135
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,680
represent the way that i think we can be

136
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,439
better we have to have a plan we have to

137
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,319
adapt and overcome

138
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,400
so i'm going to talk you know today

139
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,159
because the sock and because security

140
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:07,519
teams have more and more pressure on

141
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,040
them i'm going to talk about how can we

142
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,560
make our sock team a little bit more

143
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,920
efficient how can we deal with some of

144
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,040
these you know challenges that we're

145
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,799
facing

146
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:15,760
i am going to start with some

147
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,000
assumptions you know no two companies

148
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,600
are exactly the same no two companies

149
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,040
have exactly the same priorities the

150
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,360
same goals the same budgets so when i

151
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,880
speak about ways here i'm going to make

152
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,160
a few assumptions about the type of

153
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,800
business i'm i'm i'm looking at

154
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,479
first i'm going to assume that this is a

155
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,320
medium to large size business you know

156
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,320
so someone that has a you know an actual

157
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,160
team here you know they have some assets

158
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,600
they're trying to protect

159
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,040
i'm going to assume that there's a sock

160
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,320
that's established so i'm looking at

161
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,960
ways to optimize a sock versus implement

162
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,040
a sock so you can certainly take these

163
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,479
these lessons and think about them if

164
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,840
you're starting a new team or starting

165
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,360
some new tooling or new project from the

166
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,960
start

167
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,160
and i'm also going to assume that

168
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,400
there's a kind of general set of tooling

169
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,000
already in place so i'm going to assume

170
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,840
you already have a firewall in place you

171
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,440
have some sort of endpoint protection in

172
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,360
place some sort of monitoring i assume

173
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,280
that you already have a stem in place so

174
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,720
again whether you are in that spot or

175
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,160
not that's kind of the the spot i'm

176
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,680
jumping into to give us a baseline of

177
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,400
what we're going to talk about

178
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,000
all right final rule i do have one rule

179
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,840
for all my presentations which is that

180
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,440
it doesn't end until people ask three

181
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,199
good questions

182
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,639
so i have instructed them to lock the

183
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,639
doors in the back i know it's a very bad

184
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,479
fire hazard but i really encourage three

185
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,759
questions if you want to ask him as we

186
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,360
go that's totally fine if you want to

187
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,479
wait till the end that's fine too you

188
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,840
can raise your hand you can yell it out

189
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,680
i listen really well and we'll go from

190
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,520
there but i love the participation if we

191
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,919
can get it

192
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,680
all right so five ways here so the first

193
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,039
one

194
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,880
the stock team is responsible for an

195
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,479
overwhelming amount of data flowing into

196
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,880
them uh pretty much every system every

197
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,960
log every alert from another application

198
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,320
that's generating alerts they all tend

199
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,639
to flow into the sock so the first

200
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,400
recommendation i have is to think about

201
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,080
the data that's flowing in if you have

202
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,919
garbage coming into the sock you're

203
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,080
going to have garbage coming out

204
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,560
now the stock team is is oftentimes seen

205
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,400
as a team where you know we have a

206
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,759
compliance requirement that we need to

207
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,759
monitor this data we need to have log

208
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,280
files retained we're going to throw it

209
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,560
into a sim we're going to give it to the

210
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,840
sock

211
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,120
i can personally attest as an

212
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,800
application developer or former

213
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,080
application developer which i realize

214
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,680
probably makes me hated by many of you

215
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,520
but that's okay that i've done this

216
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,520
myself i've had a compliance requirement

217
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,199
i've said we'll just throw it into a sim

218
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,720
we're all good the stock will run some

219
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,080
rules if anything bad happens they'll

220
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,720
let us know we're good to go

221
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,560
i've grown older and wiser to realize

222
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,639
that simply throwing logs into a sock is

223
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,039
not a solution it's a compliance

224
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,560
checkbox but it hasn't actually solved

225
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,080
any problems

226
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,759
so over time i've learned well how do we

227
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,680
get out of the situation where we're not

228
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,120
just throwing everything into the stock

229
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,639
and then hoping that you know you guys

230
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,919
will magically alert you know the

231
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,520
application teams and the business team

232
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,120
to the problems

233
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,960
well it requires first thinking about

234
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,160
what's coming into the stock right

235
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,080
garbage in equals garbage out

236
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,759
so one way you can do this is by

237
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,360
understanding what are all the sources

238
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,199
of data that you're responsible for that

239
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,319
are coming in

240
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,000
i suggest creating an inventory of

241
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,360
everything that's coming into the sock

242
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,280
every log source having some sort of

243
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,759
wiki page or confluence page or or

244
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,680
google doc or whatever your preferred

245
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,919
technology of choice is for listing this

246
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:11,759
where you're able to list these are the

247
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,520
this is the log source this is the

248
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,520
system it's coming from this is the

249
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:17,120
business owner of that system this is

250
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,199
who i go to if there's a problem and

251
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,880
this is what i'm responsible for looking

252
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,000
for

253
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,280
you know now the business won't be able

254
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,800
to tell you many application developers

255
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,160
won't be to tell you exactly what to

256
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,599
look for but you may say what i'm

257
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,039
looking for is you know this is a

258
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,360
firewall log it's coming from our you

259
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,000
know our singapore entity and what i'm

260
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,680
responsible for looking for is malicious

261
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,919
traffic great you know that's at least a

262
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:38,880
starting point you're looking for

263
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,720
malicious traffic it's a firewall log

264
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,479
it's for the singapore entity maybe it

265
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,160
supports a particular you know segment

266
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,879
of the business that you can identify

267
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,800
now as opposed to having a generic log

268
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,400
source now you kind of have some context

269
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,919
around it so now when there's an alert

270
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,039
fired on that or some sort of

271
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,479
correlation detected some sort of

272
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,160
incident that you're investigating you

273
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,000
have a place to go to as your first step

274
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,680
what is that log source

275
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,599
what is the context around it who's

276
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,599
responsible for it and what am i

277
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,120
supposed to be looking for in it is that

278
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,479
within my remit and my role and

279
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:09,840
responsibility in this organization

280
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,039
that works well if you're responsible

281
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,319
for a log source right it's coming from

282
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,759
this system this is the owner this is

283
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,840
the context around it

284
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,680
another big source of data into the sock

285
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,360
is oftentimes other teams or other

286
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,960
systems might generate alerts that they

287
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,080
feed into you

288
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,759
maybe someone's running a secondary

289
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:24,879
system or something that you're not

290
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,720
responsible for managing the system but

291
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,479
they generate some sort of alerts within

292
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,479
that maybe it's a an identity and access

293
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,399
management system that has some ruling

294
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,000
or some tooling built in it's that can

295
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,360
generate you know anomalous traffic

296
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,279
anomalous logins maybe you don't get the

297
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,719
raw logs

298
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,000
so the other part is to look at anything

299
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,599
that's being generated as an alert

300
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,360
outside of the sock and being fed to you

301
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,959
as an alert and go through the same

302
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,959
process great if i'm getting an alert

303
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,880
from the iam system

304
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,959
what is that system who's responsible

305
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,720
for it what is the logic that's

306
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,240
generating that alert and what am i

307
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,360
supposed to do with it what is my

308
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,880
responsibility around it am i

309
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,160
responsible for just saying it simply

310
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,000
exists thank you very much

311
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,200
most likely you're responsible for

312
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,800
taking some further analysis or action

313
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,080
on it so you can write that down and

314
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,240
have a good understanding

315
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,600
so first we understand what's all the

316
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,519
data coming in what's the context around

317
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,200
it who's responsible for it then we can

318
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,560
make sure that when we're feeding data

319
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,000
out after we've done our analysis and

320
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,760
investigations that we have that context

321
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,839
around it so garbage n equals garbage

322
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,000
out good data in you can help get good

323
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,320
data out

324
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,200
all right

325
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,800
all good on number one

326
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,480
move to number two

327
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,640
number two is have a playbook

328
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,720
the best sports teams in the world they

329
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,399
aren't great because they just happen to

330
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,160
have an amazing player or an amazing set

331
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,000
of players they're usually great and

332
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,279
have winning records and win

333
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,959
championships because they have a

334
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:40,800
playbook they have a way that they

335
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,720
execute that that sport

336
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,399
i was a former basketball player and

337
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,680
even at you know high school level

338
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,839
basketball we would practice you know

339
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,279
what happens when there's four seconds

340
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,399
left in the game

341
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,839
you're down two points in the balls at

342
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,360
the other end of the court you had

343
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,519
prescriptive plays you would practice it

344
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,200
that's how you got good at executing

345
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,279
because it wasn't you know a hail mary

346
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,480
at the end of the game it was something

347
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,920
you'd practice for it was something you

348
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,519
knew how to do you had a playbook to

349
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,040
follow

350
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,480
so having a playbook it's no different

351
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,079
when we're responding to an alert or an

352
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,160
incident in a security investigation

353
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,800
let's take an example here

354
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,240
of you know you just got an alert that

355
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,079
says you have traffic going you know

356
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,360
through your firewall or through your

357
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,600
waff through one of your systems uh you

358
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,480
know from an endpoint to a suspicious ip

359
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,680
so the question is now what are you

360
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,360
going to do

361
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,959
regardless of the skill level in your

362
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,320
organization you want to have a written

363
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,680
down plan that says how you're going to

364
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,959
execute that

365
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,399
many of you here are probably some of

366
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,320
the the rock stars in your in your

367
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,800
soccer rock star incident uh responders

368
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,760
you know that's probably why you were

369
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,600
chosen to come here today you're like

370
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,880
already three steps ahead of me like

371
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,240
jamie this is not a problem i know

372
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,160
exactly how to investigate that alert

373
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,440
i'm going to look at what system it's

374
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,800
coming from i'm going to know the

375
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,160
context of that system i'm going to look

376
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,839
at how much traffic was it i'm going to

377
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,200
look at where that traffic's going i'm

378
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,320
going to look at the properties of that

379
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,720
ip like what's the problem

380
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,720
you're the rockstar people here in this

381
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,200
room most likely the problem is not

382
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,640
everyone has the same skill level the

383
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,040
same experience the same expertise so

384
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,560
writing down a playbook allows you to do

385
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,600
a few things one it allows you to scale

386
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,519
your team across many different

387
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,519
individuals coming on and ramp up up

388
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,680
quickly so regardless of a tier one or

389
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,680
an expert analyst you can have a similar

390
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,480
process that people are following

391
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,680
two

392
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,760
it allows you to respond faster

393
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,640
if

394
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,920
if you're relying on people to go

395
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,600
through the analysis each person might

396
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,040
have a slightly different perspective on

397
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,560
how they look at that slightly different

398
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,720
analysis if you can have it written down

399
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,480
then you're allowing people to follow a

400
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,160
more repeatable process that they can go

401
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,399
through

402
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,160
so when you look at a playbook there's

403
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,360
kind of a few elements that you can go

404
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,120
through so one is i always think of you

405
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,040
know scoping the incident first what are

406
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,959
the systems involved in that and what

407
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,040
are the details of that not all systems

408
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,399
are created equal

409
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,639
if you see suspicious traffic to an ip

410
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,320
from one endpoint device and it's maybe

411
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,240
a few packets

412
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,920
or if you see you know a lot of packets

413
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,200
maybe an exfiltration event to a

414
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,040
suspicious ip from a production server

415
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,959
where you're storing a lot of pii which

416
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,240
of those has higher priority to

417
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,600
investigate

418
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,120
now they might both be important but

419
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,720
probably that production system that's

420
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,399
possibly going through an exfiltration

421
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,760
event is a higher priority you want to

422
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,200
look at that one first

423
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,639
so you need to understand the kind of

424
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,639
nuances of the system there

425
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,160
these are things you can write down hey

426
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,279
the first thing we want to do is

427
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,279
understand what system is it coming from

428
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,320
the second thing we want to do is

429
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,160
understand how much traffic is it the

430
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,000
third thing is we want to look at the

431
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,839
the destination i want to investigate

432
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,760
certain aspects of that ip address where

433
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,600
is it hosted why was it considered

434
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,120
suspicious what type of traffic is it

435
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,399
so you can write down a playbook because

436
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,000
this is the data you need to identify

437
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,519
this is the data you need to gather

438
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,680
these are the kind of pros or the

439
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,200
the nuances of the system that you need

440
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,880
to investigate when doing this

441
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,560
and then follow that through

442
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,320
a best practice for writing a playbook

443
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,959
is to avoid dead ends

444
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,399
this is really challenging

445
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,279
because

446
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,279
it everything we do is not cut and dry

447
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,040
it's not like because this system talks

448
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,560
to that ip therefore it's bad and we

449
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,320
need to take that system off the network

450
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,399
it's always more complicated than that

451
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,320
always it's always well let me look a

452
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,720
little bit further so to whatever scent

453
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,160
possible the more you can get into the

454
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,000
details to try to avoid a dead end at

455
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,680
the end of that by documenting more

456
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,120
questions more data that you would go

457
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,800
through what's that next step the more

458
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,399
robust that playbook can be for someone

459
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,399
to execute it that's also a way that you

460
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,399
can allow lower tier analysts to execute

461
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,160
perhaps even higher level analysis

462
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,600
because you've documented it for them to

463
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,519
be repeatable

464
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:27,200
now it's not to say it's a panacea many

465
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,720
of your playbooks will end with escalate

466
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,040
to a tier 2 escalate to a tier 3 because

467
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,800
sometimes things just get complicated

468
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,160
but the more that you can resolve at the

469
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,680
lower levels the cheaper it will be the

470
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,360
more efficient you'll be and the more

471
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,880
satisfied your team will be as well and

472
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,160
the better outcomes you'll drive for the

473
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,320
business

474
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,920
so the second recommendation here is

475
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,600
create a playbook for every alert that's

476
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,560
coming in for everything you're

477
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,560
responsible for triaging and analyzing

478
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,000
have a playbook written down that says

479
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,440
what are the steps i'm going to execute

480
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,320
and walk through to do that

481
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,000
all right everyone's still with me the

482
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,360
three question rule's still in effect so

483
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,880
if you have one you can just you know

484
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,320
raise your hand you can shout it out you

485
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,680
can come sit in one of these chairs it's

486
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,239
up to you guys

487
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,000
all right the third one is you need to

488
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,399
drive focus within your organization

489
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,000
and just to be clear you do not need a

490
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,079
green ford focus i promise you this will

491
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,720
solve zero of your problems um but this

492
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,560
type of focus this is where you're

493
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,079
supposed to give a small laugh or a

494
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,920
chuckle uh it's in the notes it says

495
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,199
that's what you're supposed to do so i

496
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,000
hope you guys thank you someone perfect

497
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,600
all right you need to drive focus within

498
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,880
the sock

499
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,639
when everything's a priority nothing's a

500
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,720
priority right it's a very simple saying

501
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,480
but it's it's quite true

502
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,760
so the question becomes how do you

503
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,600
actually drive focus within the sock how

504
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:38,399
do you drive priority um the first is

505
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,760
making sure that things that are fed in

506
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,199
are actionable

507
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,880
so whenever you're investigating alerts

508
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,639
i like to always check is this alert

509
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,560
that i'm investigating leading to an

510
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,720
outcome or is it leading to a dead end

511
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,440
or a false positive or nothing

512
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,880
as you identify things that are leading

513
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,320
to false positives you need to go back

514
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,760
and tune the alerts

515
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,600
right you can't just say well hey that's

516
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,040
that's constantly happening we're just

517
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,480
going to accept it

518
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,560
i think back to early in my career i

519
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,560
started as a system administrator

520
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,480
and you know the task that we had 10 15

521
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,480
years ago was we would set up monitoring

522
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,279
on basic hardware systems you know and

523
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,720
the the example that everyone learned

524
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,120
the hard way was monitoring for cpu if

525
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,079
the cpu percentage goes over 95 send me

526
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:19,519
an alert i need to investigate that

527
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,440
system i might need to scale out another

528
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,199
you know another server i might need to

529
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,720
shut down a process i need to i need to

530
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,120
do something right cpu spiking

531
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,800
this is for those of you younger people

532
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,240
in the room this is before the cloud

533
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,920
this is when we actually had to scale

534
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,959
out physical systems uh in the world

535
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,480
and what we'd all learned the hard way

536
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,560
was that at 2 30 in the morning the sql

537
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,160
backup would run on the server it would

538
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,560
spike the cpu we'd get an alert we'd get

539
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,240
woken up and we would do absolutely

540
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,639
nothing except the sql backup run

541
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,079
and so eventually we started tuning that

542
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,920
alert right we'd say well if the cpu

543
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,560
spikes to 95 for more than 10 minutes or

544
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,560
more than 30 minutes or if it's not

545
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,000
between the hours of 2 and 3 in the

546
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,079
morning then alert me we'd then get

547
00:15:58,079 --> 00:15:59,600
alerted during daylight savings but that

548
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,360
was only twice a year so it wasn't a big

549
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,800
deal

550
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
right but that was how we worked

551
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,759
eventually we started really

552
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,199
understanding how to tune those alerts

553
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,720
what actually matters you know was it

554
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,480
duration was it time was it certain

555
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,560
periods we would exclude did we exclude

556
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,399
certain processes you have to do the

557
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,680
same thing with alerts that are feeding

558
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,120
into the suck

559
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,880
if we constantly let things come in and

560
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,880
just ignore them as false positives then

561
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,560
we create alert numbness we just always

562
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,079
ignore it we will miss something in the

563
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,120
future

564
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,959
taking the the little bit of time or

565
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,240
sometimes you know a medium amount of

566
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,160
time to go back to the root system and

567
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,920
fine-tune those alerts will pay off in

568
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,439
the end with better actionable alerts

569
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,680
the second is to prioritize and get

570
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,759
buy-in from the business

571
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,279
what actually is a priority to the

572
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,600
business uh now you can't go ask that

573
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,199
every business owner will tell you two

574
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,199
one of two things either it's all a

575
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,279
priority or one of three things they'll

576
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,040
give you a wrong answer that you just

577
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,560
really shouldn't believe

578
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,079
two they'll tell you everything's a

579
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,160
priority or they'll tell you like it's

580
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,560
your job just protect me stop everything

581
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,320
like your job is to to keep me out of

582
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,480
the front page news that's what i want

583
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,559
there's a really unhelpful answers to

584
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,240
actually prioritize

585
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,160
so what i encourage is people who are

586
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,599
leading the security team leading the

587
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,400
sock to to be proactive about going back

588
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,919
to the business with a recommendation

589
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,000
with trade-offs with business language

590
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,880
about

591
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,640
how we can actually drive priority and

592
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,119
within the within what we're doing

593
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,720
so one way to do this is to speak and

594
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,400
try to speak in business language this

595
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,720
can be really hard uh to do but let me

596
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,919
give you an example

597
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,320
uh you might go and say hey

598
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,160
looking at the threat landscape i

599
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,160
estimate we should be budgeting you know

600
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,000
a half million dollars to pay out a

601
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
ransom this year because everyone around

602
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,280
us is getting hit

603
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,320
you know that's what i think is the

604
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,679
average payout for a business of our

605
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,440
size based on some research or analysis

606
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,480
you've done

607
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,679
so we should just budget for it it's

608
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,280
going to happen this is going to say

609
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,160
like well wait a minute i don't want to

610
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,760
just budget for paying a ransom that's a

611
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,919
horrible idea all right well we have an

612
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,679
option we have a trade-off we could

613
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,760
implement a really good dr system a

614
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,320
really good edr protection system and

615
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,919
you know it will help prevent that that

616
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,360
system will probably take us you know

617
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,679
maybe two hundred thousand dollars to to

618
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,000
buy to implement to get running

619
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,280
but we don't have to budget for the half

620
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,799
million of ransom because i think we'll

621
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,880
reduce that risk considerably

622
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,480
right now we're actually talking about

623
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,320
language that the business understands i

624
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,480
have a risk of 500 000 that i might have

625
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,559
to pay i have an option i can pay 200

626
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,039
000 and retire that risk or i cannot

627
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,559
right but now you're able to drive a

628
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,480
priority around a project right now

629
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,679
we're saying hey this is a project

630
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,039
that's important this is the cost to

631
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,240
implement it this is how it's going to

632
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,840
impact the business

633
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,120
that can be really uncomfortable

634
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,880
difficult conversation to drive

635
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,960
especially from within the security team

636
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,919
but i think that's how we as

637
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,760
professionals help drive this within the

638
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,039
business this is the culture this is

639
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,559
what we need to do and speaking the

640
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,080
business language can help drive some of

641
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,760
those those priorities and trade-offs

642
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,320
within the organization it's not easy

643
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,440
it's not like the business is just going

644
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,600
to say great here's 200 000 have a great

645
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,039
day but at least it gets you in the

646
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,039
conversation about driving the solutions

647
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,280
and being proactive in that conversation

648
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,840
with the business

649
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,520
all right

650
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,280
recommendation number four

651
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,360
is to integrate and automate as much as

652
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,520
possible

653
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,080
so in step two i know i said great if we

654
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,679
start writing playbooks about how do we

655
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,039
actually triage these alerts what are

656
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,400
the steps we're gonna take what are the

657
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,679
system aspects we're gonna look at

658
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:16,799
what's the information we're gonna

659
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,720
gather if you can write the playbook

660
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,240
then you can ask yourself can you

661
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,919
automate the playbook

662
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,600
automating playbooks for response really

663
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,080
comes down to two things one do you have

664
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,320
the playbook written down to automate

665
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,160
because automating a bad process is just

666
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,760
as bad as running a bad process it's

667
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,840
just doing it faster so one do you have

668
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,880
a good process do you have a good

669
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,440
playbook written and then number two now

670
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,120
it's just down to the technical skill to

671
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,960
actually automate it which if you have a

672
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,559
good playbook the technical skill is

673
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,080
usually the secondary you might have a

674
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,280
backlog of things that you're trying to

675
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,960
get done but but it's usually not the

676
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,520
the most complicated part

677
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,440
so if you have a playbook can you can

678
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,200
you automate it can you get that those

679
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,840
steps taken automatically

680
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,679
one of the biggest challenges you'll run

681
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,240
into with with creating playbooks is

682
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,840
like i said there's really no definitive

683
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,000
answer it's not never it's hardly ever

684
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,960
guaranteed that this traffic or or this

685
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,880
process or this you know

686
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,039
obscure thing i've seen in the logs

687
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,880
is truly good or bad that's why it's

688
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,200
given to the sock if it was a hard fast

689
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,559
this is a bad process it should be

690
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,799
blocked your edr would block it or your

691
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:20,720
default firewall pro you know rules

692
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,159
would block it

693
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,520
the reason why the stock team's usually

694
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,360
involved is because it's not cut and dry

695
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,200
that this is good or bad it requires you

696
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,880
to provide a little bit of analysis and

697
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,039
critical thinking and investigatory

698
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,440
research or time into that

699
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,039
so bringing in threat intelligence can

700
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,640
help you do that it can help you

701
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,880
understand is this you know traffic to

702
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,480
this ip give me more information about

703
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,320
that ip has it previously been used in

704
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,000
an attack what type of malware is it

705
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,080
associated with typically why is that

706
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,840
considered suspicious

707
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,919
okay well it's coming from this process

708
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,840
running on this endpoint okay well it's

709
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,600
a windows 10 device that's coming from

710
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,240
you know

711
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,880
svchost.exe

712
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,559
okay what else should i be looking at to

713
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,159
see if that's good or bad okay well

714
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,520
that's associated with these types of

715
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,200
malware with these hashes with these

716
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
behavioral characteristics now i can

717
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,120
keep going and investigating it so

718
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,640
bringing in some threat intelligence to

719
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,400
your process gives you more information

720
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,240
more context to be able to progress that

721
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,840
investigation faster and more

722
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,840
confidently

723
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,559
now you might not be able to drive

724
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,960
everything to an automated remediation

725
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,880
system within your environment that's

726
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,400
the panacea that would be great to

727
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,520
automatically

728
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,520
get an alert investigate it pull in the

729
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,200
context make a decision resolve the

730
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,720
ticket you know execute remediation and

731
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,720
resolve the ticket that's that's where

732
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,360
everyone wants to be but one key step to

733
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,919
get there is what i call auto enriching

734
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,840
events for your analyst

735
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,200
so if you have a playbook that says

736
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,880
right the analyst needs to gather this

737
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,720
information they need to understand what

738
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,559
system it's coming from who's the user

739
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,400
on that system they need to understand

740
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,640
these aspects of perhaps that ip you

741
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,320
know i i mentioned kind of is it

742
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,520
associated with this malware what

743
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,440
processes should they look for if you

744
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,039
can pull all of that together into the

745
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,039
ticket for the analyst you've saved them

746
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:00,240
a lot of time

747
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,159
as opposed to someone going to three

748
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,760
four five different systems to

749
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,440
investigate this you know maybe open

750
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,919
source websites free tools uh you know

751
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,200
that people are using

752
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
try to see if they have an api can you

753
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,559
call that and pull it into the ticket

754
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,480
itself now the now the analyst is

755
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,400
looking at all this in one place and now

756
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,600
they're taking exception when they're

757
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,120
going out to these other tools it's a

758
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,280
lot faster it's a lot more repeatable

759
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,559
and guess what when you escalate that

760
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,240
from tier one to tier two for more

761
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,320
investigation you have all of that work

762
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,080
in one spot so now you don't have the

763
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,679
tier two analyst repeating that because

764
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,520
they didn't trust the tier one analyst

765
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,880
or because time's elapsed they have it

766
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,039
all in one spot so if you can auto

767
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,559
enrich these events or these tickets

768
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,240
however you're sending that to your

769
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,240
analyst with more context you've saved

770
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,600
them a lot of time you've made it more

771
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,919
repeatable for the entire process

772
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,120
it can also be a great coaching

773
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,799
experience now that you've got all this

774
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,960
information in one spot if you expected

775
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,400
a lower level analyst to be able to

776
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,000
handle this alert you can go back and

777
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,240
coach them say hey you know here's the

778
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,159
information that was in the ticket

779
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,840
why did you you know why did you not

780
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,600
understand this part or why did you make

781
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,520
that decision whereas if you're saying

782
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,120
like why didn't you go to tool a or tool

783
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,640
b you'll end up with a lot of like i

784
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,240
didn't have time i didn't know it i

785
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,600
didn't know i was supposed to go there

786
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,720
so the more you can bring in you can

787
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,480
also help coach and grow your analysts

788
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,159
so they can understand the better

789
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,600
processes that they should be using the

790
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,600
better analytical analysis they should

791
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,039
be executing maybe some of the technical

792
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,640
details wherever it is that they that

793
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:22,280
they might be getting lost

794
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,600
you know it's part of integrating and

795
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,120
automating see how many systems you can

796
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,120
tie into a sore one of the hardest parts

797
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,559
of implementing some sort of soar

798
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,640
technology is having a playbook and then

799
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,480
another is is getting the integration

800
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,919
set up and stood up to each of the

801
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,120
different tools

802
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,480
perhaps you have a process where you're

803
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,960
looking for leaked credentials from a

804
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,480
from any of your employees their

805
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,159
credentials have been leaked or stolen

806
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:43,840
you want to know about that and reset it

807
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,240
if you can use a system to to automate

808
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,640
that to to get the stolen credentials to

809
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,400
validate they're an active employee and

810
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,679
then maybe hook into your active

811
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,279
directory or your octa or whatever

812
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,120
you're using as iam system

813
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,559
if you can do that you can execute a lot

814
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,720
of automation through that

815
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,240
it's oftentimes a big challenge to get

816
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,240
access to the tools but again pushing

817
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:04,000
that this is a priority for the business

818
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,360
because you've aligned with the business

819
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,880
priorities can help you execute that and

820
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,480
get the access and the permissions that

821
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,440
you need to to do this

822
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,600
and then my final part is or maybe word

823
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,600
of caution is when you're thinking about

824
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,200
automation you need to understand the

825
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,720
different systems and the impacts that

826
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,760
they have

827
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,200
so one of my favorite examples is if

828
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,120
we're looking at leaked credentials and

829
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,880
we're going to try to automate perhaps a

830
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,640
you know password force password reset

831
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,240
or a lockout process

832
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,000
it's a feature i call don't lock out

833
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,640
your ceo from the company and what this

834
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,400
means is you need to understand that

835
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,000
different employees or different systems

836
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,600
have different rules and you may not

837
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,720
like that they have different rules but

838
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,480
they have different rules right an ecom

839
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,080
system versus an endpoint you can lock

840
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,760
out someone you know if you lock out an

841
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,919
engineer from you know from their build

842
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,520
system or from something like that for a

843
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,200
few hours they'll yell and scream of

844
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,200
course they'll complain but if you take

845
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,679
down your ecom system for four hours

846
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:54,880
that's a lot more painful to the

847
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,840
business

848
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,440
so you do need to understand the nuances

849
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,200
of these different systems and what the

850
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,640
different impacts to the business are so

851
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,480
that you have the right uh threshold

852
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,320
there and you'll get it wrong sometimes

853
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,520
you know that most businesses will

854
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,440
accept that but uh but trying to

855
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,120
understand those those differences gives

856
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,200
you a better uh confidence in what

857
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,559
you're automating because you can always

858
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,720
make an exception to say hey if it's the

859
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,880
ceo like open a ticket and i want an

860
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,039
analyst to handle that manually right

861
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,039
that's better than locking them out but

862
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,400
it's also better to have an exception

863
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,480
for the ceo and the c-suite than it is

864
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,000
to not move forward with automation at

865
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
all

866
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,880
all right and the final one is

867
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,720
what gets measured gets managed what

868
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,799
gets managed gets improved so you need

869
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,159
to really measure everything that's

870
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:39,919
happening within your your organization

871
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,520
within your team

872
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,039
so there's a few places you can start to

873
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,480
measure

874
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,320
first is measure the amount of alerts

875
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,440
that are coming in and the amount of

876
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,120
alerts that you're generating

877
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,640
just looking at the volume is it going

878
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,720
up over time is it going down over time

879
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,880
is it staying flat you know it's a lot

880
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,240
easier to go when you're saying hey i

881
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,159
need to hire two more analysts next year

882
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:59,840
when you say let me show you the alert

883
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,600
volume we've dealt with over the past 12

884
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,000
months and how it's gone up 42

885
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,600
um that's a much more concrete

886
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,080
conversation than uh you know we're not

887
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,679
keeping up with tickets we're behind we

888
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,360
just need more analysts now it shows

889
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,559
that you're really managing that part of

890
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,000
the business

891
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,919
look at this by source if you have

892
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,120
different business units that are

893
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,799
responsible for feeding into your sock

894
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,159
or different teams

895
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,400
it's also really powerful to say hey i'd

896
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,000
like to show you how many alerts we're

897
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,480
getting from this team over here

898
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,080
uh you know whether it's a geography or

899
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,520
whatever that business unit organization

900
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,600
that you have is uh they're generating

901
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,520
80 of our load

902
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,279
okay well now the business can say great

903
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,400
that team is going to pay for you to

904
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,520
have another analyst right i'm going to

905
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,559
take a little bit of their budget and

906
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,159
maybe give it to you again now you've

907
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,440
got the data to help drive those

908
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,039
conversations

909
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,159
and then what's your mean time to

910
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:45,440
response how many tickets are you

911
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,880
actually getting to and how long is it

912
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,200
taking you you know this can give you a

913
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,640
threshold a bit of set improvements hey

914
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,559
we want to implement some programs to

915
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,000
get our mean time to response or a

916
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
number of tickets handled by endless one

917
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,760
you know up by 10 percent this year or

918
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,919
improved by 10 percent uh and these are

919
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,039
some programs that we're going to talk

920
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,200
about to execute to do that now you have

921
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,000
some measurements to drive that

922
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,440
if you're creating playbooks whether

923
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,960
they're a manual that you've written

924
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,880
down or whether they're automated in

925
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,960
some sort of tooling you can measure the

926
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,960
volume that they're being executed this

927
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:18,320
gives you a couple of things one

928
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:19,840
are you automating the right things if

929
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,200
you have a playbook that's being run

930
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,039
hundreds of times a month that's a great

931
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,720
candidate for automation if you have a

932
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,039
playbook that's being run once a month

933
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,559
that's probably a poor candidate for

934
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,159
automation you'll have a lower roi on

935
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,080
that so measuring how often a playbook

936
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,919
is being executed whether it's a manual

937
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,520
playbook that someone's walking through

938
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,039
or whether it's an automated playbook

939
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,039
gives you that that roi essentially

940
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,240
calculation right off the bat

941
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,960
you can try to measure the the relevance

942
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,880
what i mean by relevance is how many

943
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,240
tickets are you getting that are true

944
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,600
positives that you're investigating and

945
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,279
leading to a specific outcome or

946
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,559
incident that you're investigating

947
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,559
versus our false positives

948
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,320
i like to use effectively two different

949
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,399
statuses on a ticket to do this so i

950
00:27:58,399 --> 00:27:59,679
might have a status that says this

951
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,120
ticket is closed which means i

952
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,200
investigated it and the incidents closed

953
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,600
or a status of maybe dismissed and a

954
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,120
dismissed might mean hey this was

955
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,120
useless i did nothing with this it was

956
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,840
effectively a waste of my time or

957
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,960
maybe something i didn't want to spend

958
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,000
my time on

959
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,679
or closed means it was actually a real

960
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,360
thing this gives me that ability to

961
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,960
measure over time how many tickets am i

962
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,640
dismissing versus investigating and

963
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,279
closing uh and is that going up or down

964
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,039
if i want to drive actionability of the

965
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,880
alerts coming in if i want to tune them

966
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,480
having this metric gives me that ability

967
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,600
to to base that off of

968
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,600
and then just two more here one concept

969
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,960
i've used successfully is called a

970
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,880
continuous improvement board where you

971
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,320
assemble a team this can be you know

972
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,559
maybe three or four people within your

973
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,080
organization hopefully different skill

974
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,279
sets or different kind of diverse

975
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,760
opinions it could be a a great analyst

976
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,039
it could be someone from the engineering

977
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,880
team someone from an analyst team

978
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,720
however you're organized but create a

979
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,399
board that meets maybe once a month

980
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,399
reviews these metrics and then can come

981
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,080
up with suggestions and recommendations

982
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,559
on improvements this way it's you know

983
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,159
getting the best opinions hopefully from

984
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,760
the team getting the brain power of

985
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,600
multiple people together can be a great

986
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,279
way to drive improvement within your

987
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,799
team that you have some of your your

988
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:08,720
best analyst part of this continuous

989
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,799
improvement report board to review the

990
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,559
metrics and suggest programs and

991
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:14,159
improvements this is where a lot of the

992
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:15,840
good ideas will come from hey if we

993
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,440
automate this playbook it'll drive this

994
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,279
outcome or like that sounds like great

995
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,559
but it's really hard we should do this

996
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,399
other one instead and here's why you can

997
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,080
have a team that's reviewing that month

998
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,679
over month or quarter over quarter

999
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:27,279
whatever the right cadence is for your

1000
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,279
business to try to drive improvement

1001
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:30,880
requires having the metrics but then you

1002
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,480
can have that team working on continuous

1003
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,640
improvement

1004
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,320
and finally the more you measure the

1005
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,480
more you have the metrics to bring to

1006
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,919
executives that are asking you about

1007
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,279
things whether it's how many tickets are

1008
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,600
we responding to or is our risk going up

1009
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,679
are we getting an roi on this tool you

1010
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:46,880
know why do you need to hire more

1011
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,360
analysts having the the executive the

1012
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,720
metrics

1013
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,720
there because you're measuring stuff the

1014
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,559
right stuff gives you the ability to

1015
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,399
provide that up to them

1016
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,240
i'm a big fan personally of managing up

1017
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,799
within my business and so i proactively

1018
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,320
send out monthly reports on what my

1019
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,919
team's working on and what they're doing

1020
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:05,440
and what our metrics are each month i'm

1021
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,279
not asked for it but now i'm controlling

1022
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,480
the conversation controlling the

1023
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,640
narrative up to that that executive so

1024
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,000
that by the time i'm asking for more

1025
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,360
resources in eight months they've heard

1026
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,880
it eight months in a row and what the

1027
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,320
problem is so now they kind of

1028
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,240
understand what the goal is when i go to

1029
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,919
them at just the end i get a really bad

1030
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,919
response so i find that proactively

1031
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:23,360
sending out metrics shows that you're on

1032
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,039
top of your business as a as a sock

1033
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,799
leader it also allows you to control the

1034
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,200
narrative up to your to your executives

1035
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,640
and same thing if you're a cso if you're

1036
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,640
in charge of it up to the ceo up to the

1037
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,320
board up to whatever that next level is

1038
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,240
is there giving them the metrics and

1039
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,279
visibility of what's happening

1040
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,880
all right this is where you're going to

1041
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,000
want to start preparing one of your

1042
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,919
three good questions that's coming up

1043
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,320
very quickly so remember nobody gets to

1044
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,240
leave until we go through that process

1045
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,080
so summary the five things to think

1046
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,159
about one is the stock is responsible

1047
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,840
for so much data coming in but if you're

1048
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,120
getting garbage in you're gonna get

1049
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,799
garbage out so you need to understand

1050
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,480
you need to inventory and document all

1051
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,399
this all the sources of logs and alerts

1052
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:02,000
coming into the stock who's the owner

1053
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,159
what's the context around that write

1054
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,080
down a playbook for each alert what is

1055
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,760
the process that the analyst needs to go

1056
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,039
through what's this

1057
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,559
the system nuances they need to know

1058
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,320
what's the data they need to gather to

1059
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,960
bring that in to make a decision

1060
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,480
drive focus within the business if

1061
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,840
everything's a priority nothing's a

1062
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,919
priority so if you can tune the alerts

1063
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,120
that are coming in you can have more

1064
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,200
focus you can identify some alerts as

1065
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,120
higher priority than others coming in

1066
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,480
now you have a priority your team can

1067
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,880
work on

1068
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,320
i would not like to allow that thank you

1069
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,600
automate and integrate as much as

1070
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,799
possible

1071
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,240
if you have a playbook written down ask

1072
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,760
yourself can you automate it can you at

1073
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,440
least gather information and intel

1074
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,360
together to feed into that analyst to

1075
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,799
give them a central point of everything

1076
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,399
they need to look at use threat

1077
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,399
intelligence to try to bring additional

1078
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,159
context or try to make that decision as

1079
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,000
automated as possible

1080
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,600
and then finally what gets measured gets

1081
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,039
managed and what gets managed gets

1082
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:54,640
improved so you need to measure these

1083
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,159
key metrics within the business about

1084
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:57,519
how many how many tickets are you

1085
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,120
responding to how many are leading to

1086
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,960
false positives how many are actionable

1087
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,799
how long is that taking is the volume

1088
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,640
going up or down what business unit is

1089
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,559
generating the most alerts measuring

1090
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:07,840
these things give you the metrics that

1091
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,600
you need to drive improvement within

1092
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,279
your team within your organization and

1093
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:12,399
drive the outcomes that you're looking

1094
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,799
for

1095
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,480
so before we move to the final questions

1096
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,720
and the moderator comes up uh here i

1097
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,000
just want to say thank you all for for

1098

listening it's you know always a

1099
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,399
pleasure to get to talk about this i

1100
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,000
hope you found some relevance to it if

1101
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,279
you want to look me up on linkedin or

send me an email directly i'm always

1103
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:28,320
happy to chat more directly about these

1104
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,159
topics or you can of course find it over

1105
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,000
at our booth later today as well so i'll

1106
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,360
invite some questions but otherwise

1107
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,550
thank you very much

1108
00:32:35,550 --> 00:32:41,369
[Applause]

1109
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,480
thank you very much

1110
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,399
so uh in the dying minutes there turned

1111
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:47,679
out to be more questions than just my

1112
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:48,480
own

1113
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:51,200
so um of these uh it's actually a couple

1114
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,760
more that just popped up as well um okay

1115
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,600
so based on your experience what are the

1116
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,440
top three metrics that executives or

1117
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,600
boards are interested in from a sock

1118
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,159
yeah so top three metrics uh

1119
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,760
executives are always looking for the

1120
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,440
the outcomes not the raw volume so

1121
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,880
usually looking for how many incidents

1122
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,720
did we have what was how long did it

1123
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,640
take us to resolve it and how much did

1124
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,320
that cost me and it's really hard to get

1125
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,640
the how much did it cost me um you know

1126
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,320
one but if you can get to some proxy

1127
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:17,760
metrics around it you can usually get

1128
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,600
there pretty close

1129
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,679
uh my own question since somebody else

1130
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,519
seems to have liked it rather than just

1131
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,440
the seam and saw technologies is it a

1132
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,200
dedicated instant response platform or a

1133
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:29,360
dedicated incident handling capability

1134
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:32,240
that's the key enabler for stock

1135
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,039
uh

1136
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:34,880
so i think it's always going to a little

1137
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,960
bit depend on on the organization what

1138
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,039
the right tool set is i don't think

1139
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,720
there's any panacea tool there's you

1140
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,159
know maybe every vendor out there tells

1141
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:43,360
you that their tool will solve all your

1142
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,720
problems i really think it's about

1143
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,720
understanding uh what are the threats to

1144
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,640
your business what's likely to happen

1145
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,679
and how are you gonna respond to that

1146
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,120
with a good playbook

1147
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,240
and i don't think there's a single tool

1148
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,080
out there that's the silver bullet

1149
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,720
how do you deal with soft fatigue

1150
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,440
how do you deal with stock fatigue um

1151
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,440
if people are wasting their time

1152
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,200
triaging false positive alerts i think

1153
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,200
that's what leads to fatigue and leads

1154
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,399
to just like why am i here what am i

1155
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,159
doing i'm just getting worked harder so

1156
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:12,239
if you what i encourage is try to work

1157
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,839
back to the source of what's generating

1158
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,839
those alerts that are coming in that if

1159
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,760
you can get actionable alerts in then

1160
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,960
working in the stock is actually a kind

1161
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,399
of interesting process because you're

1162
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,839
investigating crazy stuff that's

1163
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:23,520
happening in the world

1164
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,719
if people are investigating false

1165
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,639
positives and silly alerts that leads to

1166
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,679
fatigue

1167
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,719
and then finally if you can get the

1168
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,079
metrics so that you have a properly

1169
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:31,918
staffed team or if you can automate the

1170
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,199
program so that you have a properly

1171
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,119
staffed and resource organization that

1172
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,639
can can help

1173
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,639
as well so that leads quite nicely into

1174
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,480
the next one how many playbooks is too

1175
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,440
many

1176
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,879
how many playbooks is too many i would

1177
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:44,719
say if a playbook is being executed less

1178
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,040
than once a quarter then it's probably

1179
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:50,239
uh a lower priority playbook

1180
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,520
but that's going to depend on your your

1181
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,359
volume but it'll just get stale if it's

1182
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:55,119
not being executed

1183
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,879
and can you tell us about a playbook

1184
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:59,760
you've automated that worked really well

1185
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,040
a playbook that i've automated that

1186
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,040
works really well i would say the most

1187
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,599
effective has been auto enriching alerts

1188
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,640
um

1189
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,480
trying to execute the full remediation

1190
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,320
has been really challenging from what

1191
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:12,400
i've seen from most people but

1192
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,079
bringing together the intelligence as

1193
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,680
opposed to gathering it i found to be

1194
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,440
the most effective because it can make

1195
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,200
the decision making much much faster and

1196
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,800
give you a record over time of what's

1197
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,400
happening

1198
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,839
and that follows on to the next question

1199
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:24,880
that's just popped up how do you

1200
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,480
optimize threat intelligence within your

1201
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,839
playbooks

1202
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:30,560
uh optimizing threat intelligence trying

1203
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,480
to as much as possible get to a yes or

1204
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,200
no

1205
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,960
decision um

1206
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,240
and that a lot of times it's going to

1207
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,359
depend on what's the risk that you're

1208
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:39,359
willing to take of a false positive or

1209
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,760
being overly aggressive in that response

1210
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,320
so whether it's based off of a score or

1211
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,839
whether it's based off of you know more

1212
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,160
context if you can get to yes or no you

1213
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,119
can move to the next step in the

1214
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,640
playbook if you can't get to a yes or no

1215
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,480
because it's like a 50 risk which is

1216
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,560
really annoying to deal with

1217
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,000
then you're going to have to kind of

1218
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,800
revert back to a manual triage

1219
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,640
and uh the last one we've got in here is

1220
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,560
uh harking back to the early parts of

1221
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,560
your slides uh what position did you

1222
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,160
play and uh

1223
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,720
does defence win championships

1224
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,640
so you mean long story on what position

1225
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,960
i played i started off and i was uh i

1226
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,720
was really tall so i was a forward or

1227
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,640
center and then i stopped growing so i

1228
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,160
became a point guard when everyone got

1229
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,000
taller so it just made me a really

1230
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,079
baller number three you know wing player

1231
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,839
with really good ball skills decent

1232
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:26,320
shooting but able to play in the post so

1233
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,119
it was a lot of fun and uh then i i got

1234
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:30,480
older and got worse and i became a

1235
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,680
defensive specialist i'm going with

1236
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,320
defense wins championships yeah

1237
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,160
so back on topic um in terms of

1238
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,240
optimization how would you dedicate

1239
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,400
resources in playbook development

1240
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,720
is it a senior analyst job

1241
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,839
what would you actually do yeah would

1242
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,200
you actually expand on that for playbook

1243
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,640
development i like to have diversity of

1244
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,480
opinions so someone mid-level someone

1245
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,440
senior

1246
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,880
pair them up together have them go

1247
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,720
attack a playbook and then have a review

1248
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,560
process so they create the playbook and

1249
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,680
then you have two or three other people

1250
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,599
that review it and can comment on it not

1251
00:36:57,599 --> 00:36:58,960
just to say great job thanks for the

1252
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,040
work but to try to make the nuanced

1253
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,960
decisions a little bit better or make it

1254
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,800
simpler as possible but i like pairing

1255
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,400
up two people if you have the resources

1256
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,760
to do that because it helps your junior

1257
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,599
analysts grow and to the point about

1258
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,599
alert fatigue if people are part of the

1259
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,320
solution they tend to be more engaged

1260
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,320
as opposed to i'm just here to do what

1261
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:18,640
i'm told all day that can help drive a

1262
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,320
improvement within your team morale and

1263
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,640
team structure as well

1264
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,640
and uh one that i seem to be tripping

1265
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,640
over from time to time again how do you

1266
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,000
do this when you've only got a micro

1267
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
sock with one one and a half or even

1268
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
only part of a person to fill that

1269
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,040
function

1270
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,720
yeah i think it's it's even more

1271
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,240
important when it's a small team it's at

1272
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,680
that point it's about driving priority

1273
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,040
with the business hey we've got this

1274
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,480
many tickets this is what we need to get

1275
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,160
to and either we're going to have to you

1276
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,760
know we need to spend ten percent of our

1277
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,599
time moving to the next level so i'm

1278
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,119
only going to allocate you know 80 90

1279
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,640
percent of that resource to to daily

1280
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,880
ticket triage i will allocate 10 of

1281
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,640
their time to playbook development and

1282
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,560
automation and getting ahead and if the

1283
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,680
business doesn't buy into that you've

1284
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,040
got to show them the same thing hey look

1285
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,560
the threat landscape is growing this is

1286
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,240
going to be more complex this is the

1287
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,079
only approach that we have

1288
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,040
and you've got to align with the

1289
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,240
business so if you're part of the

1290
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,240
conversation there you can drive that if

1291
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,839
you're not part of the conversation then

1292
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,040
then you're going to lead to the alert

1293
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,119
fatigue the burnout uh you know some of

1294
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,880
the challenges that are really inherent

1295
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,720
so i'm not trying to say that you know

1296
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,119
that's a silver bullet um you know there

1297
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,320
are real challenges that i know

1298
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,599
everyone's facing

1299
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,119
great well thank you very much jamie

1300
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:22,160
it's been a very thought provoking and

1301
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,599
engaging presentation thank you very

1302
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:24,750
much everybody

1303
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:29,920
[Applause]

1304
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,280
so we've now got a five minute break

1305
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,400
until the next one which is the

1306
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,520
hallmarks of a high performing sock

1307
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,599
thank you that was really good at least
