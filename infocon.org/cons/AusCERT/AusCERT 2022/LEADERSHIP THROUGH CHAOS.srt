microphone

35
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,560
just for those people that are tuning in

36
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,560
on the stream that they may not be able

37
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,080
to hear you unless your voice is really

38
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,360
loud and comes here that's why we have

39
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,720
this

40
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,159
without further ado

41
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,720
i'll bring brian haye up onto the stage

42
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,400
and i'll be talking through leadership

43
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:25,119
through chaos so brian haye has a rare

44
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:27,280
blend of cyber security skills and

45
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,880
business attributes

46
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,560
long considered a thought leader in the

47
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,560
world of cyber security

48
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,320
he learned his craft not from the

49
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,159
technical demands of the industry but

50
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:37,920
rather by focusing on the activities of

51
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,079
organized crime and cyber criminals

52
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,720
through the through the a 35-year career

53
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,640
in law enforcement his talk is going to

54
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,320
talk us today through exploring the

55
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,640
concept of leadership and chaos and

56
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,960
whilst utilizing a light touch of covert

57
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,680
nostalgia to demonstrate the arguments

58
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,520
extrapolate the simple principles of

59
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,759
what the sizo and security manager face

60
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:59,759
every day can give a very warm round of

61
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,719
applause to brian haye

62
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,799
thank you

63
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,160
good morning everyone can you hear me

64
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,840
okay i think this should have kicked in

65
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,200
um look thanks very much for your time

66
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,720
it's always i consider a privilege and

67
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,800
an honor that you take the time out of

68
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,400
your schedule to share it with me so i

69
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,160
hope i won't disappoint

70
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,680
um

71
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,440
leadership and chaos well it's been a

72
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,959
crazy world for the last couple years

73
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,239
without question

74
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,760
and leadership well that's a question

75
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,280
mark isn't it and it's really i want to

76
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,959
explore today that

77
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,400
the notion that leadership means

78
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,920
different things to different people and

79
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,800
sometimes it gets a bit confusing chaos

80
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,480
or is it a new phenomena or has it been

81
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,160
with us a long time it's all a matter of

82
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,440
perspective

83
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,000
so i might challenge and i'm no expert

84
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,080
on leadership and i'm not professing to

85
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,840
be a leader

86
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,599
but i think there are lessons in all of

87
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:50,480
us for all for everyone and i'll share a

88
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,239
couple of things with you and

89
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,480
as we go forward by all means interact

90
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,560
ask a question through the process don't

91
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,319
wait for me to finish it then because

92
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,000
i'm going to try and catch up some time

93
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,040

94
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,480

sound is said to go go go go

120
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,040
and then i turn my head the same time is

121
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,680
my right side door is open and i saw the

122
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,920
one police officer with his gun and he

123
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,840
asked him don't touch don't move

124
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,080
anything the terrified cabbie was moved

125
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,399
out of the line of fire i had cause to

126
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,720
draw my gun

127
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,839
that person

128
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,240
got into a yellow taxi

129
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:25,360
and i was able to prevent a taxi from

130
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,280
leaving within a few minutes sergeant

131
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,199
haye was joined by other police who

132
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,919
dragged a bag a gun and the suspect from

133
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,160
the car the sergeant emptied the man's

134
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,320
22-caliber rifle while he was being

135
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,240
searched several other weapons were

136
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,240
found the man was taken away for

137
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,080
questioning while the man was being

138
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,840
detained other officers tended to the

139
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,160
wounded attendant he'd been shot once in

140
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,400
the chest twice in the legs and once in

141
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,639
the buttocks sergeant hey is likely to

142
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,479
be recommended for a bravery award but

143
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,320
he says his first thoughts this morning

144
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,840
were for the safety of the people in the

145
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,919
street yeah i think i'm more shaken now

146
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,639
after it's over than at the time

147
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,479
you've probably risked your own life too

148
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:03,919
have you thought about that

149
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,360
that's probably why i'm shaking after 21

150
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,360
so i know i looked a bit different now

151
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,840
to then right so i wasn't always this

152
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,000
felt figure i was a little bit slimmer

153
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,759
and a little bit uh had more color in

154
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,280
the hair and not this ash blonde that

155
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,919
you see before you today

156
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,160
but was that leadership

157
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,000
to go and afford what a was i

158
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,880
to go chase someone with a gun no crazy

159
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,320
but sometimes you just don't think and

160
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,840
that's where training incident response

161
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,199
comes in or because that was not

162
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,400
leadership i was acting purely alone

163
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,560
okay with the absence of others it can't

164
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,520
be leadership and so that to me was

165
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,759
absolutely incident response

166
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,520
and we actually have these chaotic

167
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,520
events thrust upon us from time to time

168
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,199
we have to deal with it

169
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,039
and we hope that the training the skills

170
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,639
that we have the way we approach such

171
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,720
challenges we can actually write make

172
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,080
the right decisions at the time

173
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,680
and you never know that was just a

174
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,919
bizarre who would have thought 6 30 a.m

175
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,319
queen street mall monday morning you're

176
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,840
going to be confronted with a situation

177
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,680
like that you know i can tell you and i

178
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,120
never want to experience it again but

179
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,800
when that adrenaline is pumping through

180
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,360
your mind the speed at which your brain

181
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,800
operates

182
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,360
is phenomenal and when you talk to ones

183
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,759
had that massive adrenaline dump

184
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,360
and i've only had to speak to a couple

185
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,960
of people but

186
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,880
it affects everyone physiologically

187
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,319
quite different i couldn't taste

188
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,960
anything for about eight hours it was it

189
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,759
was quite bizarre and uh you know when i

190
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,680
still look at it now i was of the fun

191
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,360
then the father of two young small boys

192
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,560
i myself still but it's crazy

193
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,160
but you know

194
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,919
chaos can strike at any time another

195
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:40,880
example

196
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,560
i was performing judy as a junior

197
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,160
officer at i think it was a 1986

198
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,120
rugby league grand final wayne bennett

199
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,960
was a coach of south wally lewis was the

200
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,280
coach of captain coach of wynham it was

201
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,960
a grand final

202
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,639
and can i just point out to you young

203
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,560
people today that streaking onto

204
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,319
football pictures and the like is not a

205
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,759
new phenomenon

206
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:04,560
so the south supporter decided he uh his

207
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,800
team was behind and he wanted to give it

208
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,639
to the manly supporters so he went and

209
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,360
jumps on the into this onto the pitch

210
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,880
pulls down his strides and bears the

211
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,039
cheeks of his clacka to the audience of

212
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,560
the opposite fans

213
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,479
i'm standing there in uniform i expected

214
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,160
to do something this was all captured by

215
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,960
the photographer at the courier mail

216
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,759
and

217
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,520
it's about you know how do you think of

218
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,880
issues so

219
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,400
he's dropped his strides and i come on

220
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,479
board so he starts to run and he's still

221
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,639
got his pants down now i used to play a

222
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,639
bit of footy so normally you would just

223
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,720
go diving tackle now if i did a diving

224
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,039
tail to his legs to take him down there

225
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,360
is a risk my nose is going to go far up

226
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,039
his clacka

227
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:44,800
that was not a risk i was prepared to

228
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,960
take i had to take action so i had to

229
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,560
give a different sort of tackling

230
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,240
technique and ground me around the waist

231
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,639
keep my arms stiff and and ultimately

232
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,080
take him to the ground the hat goes

233
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,919
flying in the air but i'd like for the

234
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,440
benefit notice that i never lost my

235
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,520
sunglasses at any time

236
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,280
so he goes down

237
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,440
then my mate comes over and he walks

238
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,560
away

239
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,919
now one of these things whenever you

240
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,919
have chaos is always treat people with

241
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,560
respect and i must say the curry miles

242
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,639
thought it was quite a humorous event

243
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,319
the next day as well

244
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,639
but the point was here i was we had a

245
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,400
laughter battle with this guy he

246
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,039
apologized he got a ten dollar fine he

247
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,960
you know no conviction recorded so it's

248
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:23,919
all good

249
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,840
and why i say you always treat people

250
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,520
well no matter what you are and what you

251
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,160
are doing i remember once i we had this

252
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,759
scumbag piece of crap called dennis

253
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,120
raymond ferguson we caught him with

254
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,039
three pedophile i said he's a pedophile

255
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,640
with another guy called alexander george

256
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,760
brooks caught him with three little

257
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,719
kitties

258
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,440
in a roman hamilton

259
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,039
many years ago

260
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,919
now

261
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,360
not the most pleasant person you'd ever

262
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,279
want to meet but i made sure i treated

263
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,200
him extraordinarily well

264
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,720
because what i wanted to achieve was the

265
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,640
outcome with he had incarceration in

266
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,399
prison for a very long time

267
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,480
so i was never going to put my let my

268
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,560
emotions get the bit of me to put that

269
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,240
conviction that penalty in jeopardy and

270
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,760
that happened

271
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,600
and so but this guy here i'm standing

272
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,680
the next year on the hill at lang park

273
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:08,320
it was atlan park then watching the

274
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,640
state of origin game and this two heads

275
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,480
down this head turns around he looks at

276
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,560
me and he swivels back around all that i

277
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,480
know you he said yeah i know you and we

278
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,640
had a laugh about it and no matter what

279
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,640
trials and tribulations you face if you

280
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,120
can always maintain a sense of humor

281
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,440
maintain your dignity and respect from

282
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,720
the other people that you're dealing

283
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,760
with

284
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,800
life will always be better for it

285
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,920
because

286
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,120
we are going to have chaotic events

287
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,440
and chaos will continue to rain and fall

288
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,440
now i am no

289
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,040
sheldon cooper i'm not going to sit here

290
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,040
and talk about chaos theory and string

291
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,680
theory i'm not that smart okay i'm a

292
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,920
burnout fraud and cyber crime detective

293
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,440
but what it will tell you there is

294
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,360
supposed to be some pattern to chaos and

295
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,720
actual fact

296
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,640
when you go through it enough there are

297
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,440
things you can develop to make it easier

298
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,519
to manage as time goes on and i'll talk

299
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,600
about that a bit later

300
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,519
but it seems to be once upon a time we

301
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,160
used to get into this routine

302
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,160
we would have highs and lows now it just

303
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,640
seems to be crazy and that's because the

304
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,880
external environment is affecting the

305
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,560
internal and everything is changing so

306
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,120
rapidly sometimes driven by technology

307
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,120
sometimes by other world events

308
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,519
sometimes things like kovid 19 we had to

309
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,600
do a massive rollout as you know remote

310
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,600
workers right across the nation

311
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,120
and then of course we had things like

312
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,880
what we got at the moment the ukraine

313
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,800
russian conflict

314
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,240
now in australia we tend to have a

315
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,680
little bit of apathy we're in a big

316
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,360
continent we think we're the center of

317
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,120
the universe the reality is we're just a

318
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,279
bit player in the world stage and these

319
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,360
things will affect us and we're not

320
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,360
probably given enough thought to how is

321
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,120
it going to affect us in 6 months and 12

322
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,920
months because there will be

323
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,519
repercussions for this that we're not

324
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,640
understanding at the moment

325
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,880
so is chaos the new norm

326
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,399
okay

327
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,040
i remember 10 years ago saying

328
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,760
chaos was the new norm and everything is

329
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,240
accelerated a factor of 10 since then

330
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,000
and it's the new norm and want to talk

331
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,360
about chaos

332
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,040
is how do you survive how do you go from

333
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,279
treading water to actually and

334
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,440
occasionally the the the eyes and the

335
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,040
nose dips below the surface of the ward

336
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,480
and you get back up again and you keep

337
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,920
struggling

338
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,160
you know who would have thought

339
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,600
that here in queensland we would have

340
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,040
locked out our own citizens and

341
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,640
prevented them from getting home for

342
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,240
months on end

343
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,440
who would have thought the crime would

344
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,720
have been running ramping on the street

345
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,480
but locking out down our borders was

346
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,079
considered more important

347
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,920
and when you know everything in the

348
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,839
events of coving 19 will be studied by

349
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,000
academics for decades

350
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,920
it's very unique

351
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,240
did our leaders and i use the term

352
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,160
loosely show leadership although

353
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,839
following the norm

354
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,839
what was their priority

355
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,200
what was the big outcome they were

356
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,399
trying to seek

357
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,959
was it communicated effectively

358
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,720
whatever it is i'm not judging right or

359
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,800
wrong but these are questions we should

360
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,320
ask for what are the lessons we can take

361
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,480
from it ourselves

362
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,079
now i'm going to tell you leadership is

363
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,320
rarer than we think it is

364
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,240
we make this mistake by thinking that

365
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,160
people in senior positions are all

366
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,519
leaders

367
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,120
they're all expected to be leaders but

368
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,560
i'm going to argue that leadership is

369
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,880
actually quite a rare phenomenon

370
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,320
i'm saying a lot of people have

371
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,680
leadership in fact every one of you

372
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,279
people in the room do possess leadership

373
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:20,320
qualities

374
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,079
will that translate to be the leader of

375
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,519
an organization or a leader of a

376
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,920
business unit or a leader of

377
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,399
two people i don't know but i'd suggest

378
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,079
to you you all have it

379
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,399
within you to be leaders depending on

380
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:33,839
what you desire

381
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,519
and that's what i'm going to do today is

382
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,120
talk about

383
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,360
how you can challenge yourself

384
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,680
to reflect upon yourselves to be better

385
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,560
people and consequently better leaders

386
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,040
and stop putting leaders on pillars and

387
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,120
mantle pieces

388
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,880
just people okay

389
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,040
and they don't always get it right now

390
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,880
here's a slide

391
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,800
which fundamentally it looks like a i

392
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,200
can't that's not me that's it there

393
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,880
guidance solution goal motivation

394
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,120
communication plan vision direction can

395
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,360
i just call for a moment

396
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,880
okay when we start to provide a textbook

397
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,600
script about what leaders should do

398
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,680
we're starting to make mistakes

399
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,120
because if you actually look at the

400
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,480
leadership theory look at all these

401
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,839
types of leaders there's democratic

402
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,440
autocratic laser fair strategic

403
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:20,959
transformational transactional coach

404
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,320
style bureaucratic which one do you want

405
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,560
to be

406
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,240
crap

407
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,399
focus on just being a good person and

408
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,560
the leadership processes will evolve

409
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,880
right i remember once saying to the one

410
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,200
of the chief executives in ntt or it was

411
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
done mentioned when i was there and i

412
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,800
said you know what i said

413
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,959
dimension data is a bureaucracy

414
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,240
and he was horrified and he looked at me

415
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,160
he said what do you mean he was quite

416
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,920
offended i said you know when you're

417
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,199
working in a bureaucracy when the

418
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:48,560
process is more important than the

419
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,160
outcome

420
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,920
you imagine people i'm sure you've made

421
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,199
it if you've worked at large especially

422
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,959
if you've worked in the public sector

423
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,800
sit there grab that bit of paper stamp

424
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,240
in the top right corner move that bit of

425
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,680
paper over that piece of paper wait for

426
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,720
someone else to give up that bit of

427
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,160
paper so they can put their stamp on

428
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,839
that bit of paper

429
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,440
are they thinking about the big picture

430
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,040
are they part of a team that's making a

431
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,040
meaningful difference or are they just

432
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,760
performing a process

433
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,920
do they lack leadership or were they

434
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,720
subject of zero leadership it makes for

435
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,519
interesting debate

436
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,760
but one of the fundamental keys to me is

437
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,959
leadership

438
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:24,560
and what distinguishes leadership and

439
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,000
for saying management which i'll touch

440
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,519
on shortly

441
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,800
is that leaders strive to make a

442
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,760
difference

443
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,680
ideally they strive to make something

444
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,040
better

445
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,040
now that i don't care

446
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,519
if they made it better or not

447
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,760
what i care about is i gave it a crack

448
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,360
to make a difference

449
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,000
okay i would get all of my new staff in

450
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,440
when i came to the fraud and cybercrime

451
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,360
group i'd put them down i'd say okay

452
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,519
let's establish some ground rules this

453
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,880
is what i think this is the vision

454
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,480
where do you want to be in three years

455
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,160
five years seven years sometimes i

456
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,440
didn't know

457
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,760
i said what's your career aspirations

458
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:03,199
i said i've got you for a short time

459
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,839
and my job is to maximize the benefits

460
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,600
to you whilst you're here and my job is

461
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,680
to work for you so how can i help you

462
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,480
get promoted and i would talk about

463
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,760
and i would say bring me your

464
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,600
applications when you want to go for

465
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,279
promotion

466
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,360
and i would tell them do not bring me an

467
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,440
application that says all this

468
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,639
highfalutin philanthropic

469
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,720
buzzword crap

470
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:30,160
give me a litany of the demonstrated

471
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,920
areas and evidence where you made a

472
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,279
difference

473
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,800
because the rest will take care of

474
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,240
itself

475
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,600
so

476
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,040
that's what i would do set the

477
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,800
expectations understand and i said i

478
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,959
will never ever have a go at you for

479
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,399
making a mistake

480
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,079
if you make the same mistake three times

481
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,839
a minute of conversation but

482
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,199
fundamentally

483
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,959
i will always support you if you made a

484
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,079
mistake

485
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,680
but

486
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,839
i will have a crack at you if you don't

487
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,240
do anything so it's all about actions

488
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,639
and it's about inspiring and coaching

489
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,320
and nurturing

490
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,240
other people not so much about yourself

491
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,759
you know this guy says leadership is

492
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,920
about change and then he talks about

493
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,519
inspiration

494
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,440
if you want to be a leader

495
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,120
think about change

496
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,959
if you want to be a manager

497
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,199
and let me just say managers are vital

498
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,480
to leaders

499
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,079
not everyone can be at the top of the

500
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,839
potent pole when the look of our team of

501
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:26,079
huskies and there's ten dogs running

502
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,839
it's only the front one or two that

503
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,920
actually see the horizon the rest always

504
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,440
sees the other dogs butts in front of

505
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,720
them okay

506
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,480
but they're incredible because without

507
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,720
those people doing the grunt work those

508
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
those people are useless at the front

509
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,279
because they can't go anywhere

510
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:42,800
so

511
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,040
think about how you change because i'm

512
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,959
going to say to you if you're not

513
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,160
changing you're not leading and that is

514
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,759
business as usual okay that's a

515
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,120
management role

516
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,839
and leadership is all about actions not

517
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,519
position

518
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,279
how many people have been in more senior

519
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,040
positions you and your dad said they've

520
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,399
got their head up their ass most of the

521
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,480
time and have no idea what's going on

522
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,240
they lack the skills the understanding

523
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,000
the appreciation of the environment and

524
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,439
do they make a positive quality

525
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,119
difference to your life and that life of

526
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,359
the organization in the public sector

527
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,400
you may have heard of the peter

528
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,720
principle and trust me it is living

529
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,400
thriving and strong

530
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,319
the peter principle is you promote

531
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,319
people to get rid of them

532
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,880
into higher positions beyond their level

533
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,559
of competence

534
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,799
and sadly it should never happen

535
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,000
but it does and i'm sure you've all seen

536
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,480
p leaders put into positions i shouldn't

537
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,240
call them leaders people put into those

538
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,480
positions expecting to be leaders that

539
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,160
are completely incompetent for the role

540
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,799
and task

541
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:44,240
so

542
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,960
leadership is not a position

543
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,760
it is not about being popular we get

544
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,440
this notion sometimes that everyone a

545
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,799
good leader is someone that everyone

546
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,039
loves absolutely not

547
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,799
because you have to make decisions on

548
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,799
not everyone will agree with

549
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,840
and in times of chaos more importantly

550
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,880
they're thinking what the hell are they

551
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,160
making that decision for that's

552
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,480
ridiculous let's form a committee

553
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,080
okay

554
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,840
and sometimes you simply don't have the

555
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,720
time and i apologize later ladies i

556
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,480
didn't construct that slide i

557
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,640
unashamedly stole it

558
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,400
and so it's not a one-man show but a

559
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,480
one-person show

560
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,559
one person no leadership

561
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,840
team of people now there's an

562
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,120
opportunity

563
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,720
and the other thing accept

564
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,320
responsibility and accountability for

565
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,080
your actions and be

566
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,240
as humble with yourself

567
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,080
as you are with the team

568
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,160
okay as i said before

569
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,679
i'll never have a go at anyone for

570
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,080
making a mistake and forgive yourself

571
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,000
because sometimes i've seen leaders beat

572
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,160
themselves up because they got it wrong

573
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,880
it was proven later so what

574
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,960
did the world stop no

575
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,559
was an opportunity to learn absolutely

576
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:55,120
and another and critical thing through

577
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,200
when you're dealing with these chaotic

578
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,880
crazy events and you're trying to find

579
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,039
the way forward is

580
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,600
understand the perception of others

581
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,080
of the team the internal the external

582
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,760
can i just ask people in the room for

583
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:08,720
example

584
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,280
can you put up your hand that shoe

585
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,400
is it

586
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,720
let's call it a teal green

587
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,840
edge

588
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,240
with grey on a grey shoe who puts who

589
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,400
says that

590
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,520
okay

591
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,400
put up your hand if you see a green

592
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,360
teal edged shoe on a that is pink

593
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,559
yeah

594
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,600
okay normally i get more closer to 50 50

595
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,640
here it's about 90 10

596
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,280
but the perception by some is that is a

597
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,559
pink shoe

598
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,160
and they will argue

599
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,400
black and blue that is a pink shoe and

600
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,840
others will say what are you talking

601
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,000
about you dip it's a green

602
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,559
it's a grey shoe

603
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,600
sometimes

604
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,840
perception is reality you know we go

605
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,360
into organizations and we do these

606
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,360
things called cultural diagnostics to

607
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,600
understand perceptions beliefs attitudes

608
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,360
behavioural norms and you have to take

609
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,960
that all into account the world is not

610
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,080
black and white

611
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,679
we have so many people with different

612
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,240
diverse backgrounds which is fantastic

613
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,360
and we see and bring a character

614
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,280
if we can homogenize that view of the

615
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,640
world then we can have a whole new

616
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,840
landscape of opportunity so

617
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,400
understand just because you say so

618
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,760
doesn't mean people will believe it to

619
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,720
be true and sometimes it first of all

620
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,159
scan the environment to understand the

621
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,840
fundamental perceptions

622
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,240
and then manage that the way you need to

623
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,000
to further have a chance of success

624
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,679
now i said it before

625
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,520
you know

626
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,880
i'm not going to call them bad leaders

627
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,679
i'll put say bad people in positions of

628
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,200
potential leadership

629
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,559
we're all going to encounter them but

630
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,919
can i just say

631
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,840
those people and you see when someone

632
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,600
goes into an organization and everyone

633
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,919
leaves you've got a problem

634
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,960
can i just say you can learn just as

635
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,159
much

636
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:58,480
from a bad leader or a person in that

637
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,400
authority doing the wrong thing

638
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:01,919
and i don't mean corrupt wrong thing

639
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,559
i've just been incompetent

640
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,480
as you can from a quality leader in fact

641
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,080
you can learn more because when we have

642
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,159
and work for a good leader we really

643
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,919
appreciate it what happens human nature

644
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,000
is we start to take it for granted

645
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
and we forget how wonderful these people

646
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,280
are and how they really work hard for us

647
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,600
but with someone not so competent it's

648
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,960
right there in your face but what that

649
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,880
also presents and is an opportunity for

650
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,280
you to stand up and show your leadership

651
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,400
to actually dare also help them and fill

652
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,760
some of the voids and the challenges

653
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:34,799
will be ensuing after people leave

654
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,400
okay so

655
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:40,080
every moment is a learning moment

656
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,080
click

657
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,480
click here we go what is management so

658
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,640
just for the difference planning leading

659
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,960
organizing administering or controlling

660
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,480
now you notice it has an element of

661
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,080
leadership in it but managers

662
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,919
fundamentally aren't leaders but they

663
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,440
some good managers do have some good

664
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,520
leadership troops and there's no reason

665
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,200
you cannot be both

666
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,280
but generally as i said before

667
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,280
leadership is change and taking people

668
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,120
on the journey

669
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,799
management is getting the business as

670
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,960
usual done and you need we all need good

671
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,400
managers

672
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,919
and if you're happy to be a manager and

673
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:13,600
not a leader or a manager with good

674
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,320
leadership traits fantastic one is not

675
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,679
i'm not saying here one is better than

676
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,919
the other but what i do challenge you to

677
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,919
think is what do you want to be

678
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,240
and understand the basic parameters of

679
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,919
that behaves and the qualities it need

680
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:28,240
to do it well

681
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,760
so

682
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,600
i'm going to say the two attributes of

683
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,520
leadership we need to focus on

684
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,679
is change making a difference

685
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,760
and people if you're not embracing

686
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,480
people you're not being a leader

687
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,280
and can i tell you in times of chaos

688
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,200
your people need leadership and

689
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,360
direction more than ever before they

690
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,039
don't need someone to be perfect that's

691
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,360
not us it's not them but they do needs

692
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,360
people that are prepared to take on and

693
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,039
the challenge at hand

694
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,720
and one of the where i see it often in

695
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,200
the itc world

696
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,240
where the people side isn't considered i

697
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,080
call it implementation versus

698
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,679
installation in this case on the slide

699
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,760
installation versus implementation

700
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,440
installation you can hook up the

701
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,200
software you can hook up the hardware

702
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,880
and you can actually put a new piece of

703
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,640
technical kit on board

704
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,240
but if you haven't taken people in the

705
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,080
organizational journey and appraise them

706
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,679
of it got their support their feedback

707
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,440
done some focus groups

708
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,520
you may not get implementation i was

709
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,280
talking to one person from university in

710
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,360
victoria a couple of years ago and they

711
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,960
were frustrated they spent millions on

712
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,280
this check roll out it was adopted and

713
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,360
used by eight percent of the university

714
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,520
because they never involved people in

715
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,480
the process

716
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,640
and gave them a heads up so think about

717
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,360
the human element more regularly

718
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,880
the other thing admit little myth i'd

719
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,400
like to challenge is we tend to think

720
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,080
the leadership should come from the top

721
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:46,960
down

722
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,559
absolutely not

723
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,120
encourage leadership attributes from the

724
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,919
bottom up as well simultaneously

725
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:55,679
you know it's not an ego thing it's

726
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,039
about what is the difference we can

727
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,880
collectively make by working effectively

728
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,200
as a team together and ideally the

729
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,720
leadership the leader has set the vision

730
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,200
and people understand then with that

731
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,520
vision to achieve it

732
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,240
they've set the values the beliefs

733
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,240
so we understand what's right and wrong

734
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,919
what's when in parameter what is not in

735
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:17,360
parameter and how we're going to

736
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,000
collectively again can

737
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,919
assimilate to make a difference

738
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,440
but please don't think that if you're

739
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,039
the top of the organization you have to

740
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,039
make all the decisions that's nuts

741
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,400
there's too much going on especially

742
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,559
with times of chaos

743
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,559
you need decision making support you

744
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:34,640
need to get the information and you need

745
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,400
your people to work as a collegiate team

746
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,360
now for everything that i've said

747
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,360
and all the world things that's first

748
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,919
times experienced this chaos especially

749
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,440
here in australia

750
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,360
are you me

751
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,600
you people in the cyber security

752
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,679
community have been dealing with chaos

753
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,240
for over a decade and my hat goes you're

754
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,320
my champions

755
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,120
you deal with this every single day to a

756
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,880
scale that most other people in your

757
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,919
organization have no idea about

758
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,400
no idea whatsoever and i started putting

759
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,480
this light on an exploding head and i

760
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,000
started putting just some of the things

761
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,600
that thrown at you all today vendor

762

00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
that's on the outside and it's nuts

772
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,320
right

773
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,360
i've got more here risk and

774
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,960
vulnerability assess it's managing the

775
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,200
team

776
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,559
oh my god

777
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,400
how do you have time to draw breath in a

778
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,080
day

779
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,720
what do you people do is extraordinary

780
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,559
and you're showing leadership and

781
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,880
extraordinary management capabilities

782
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:54,000
every single day but sometimes you just

783
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,400
don't realize it

784
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,039
the simple reality is

785
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,279
you've been managing chaos pretty much

786
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,880
since day one

787
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,720
and people don't understand it because

788
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,840
you're doing it quietly and competently

789
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,840
and quite too often sometimes with not

790
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,919
enough support maybe that needs to be

791
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,760
vocalized a bit more

792
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,120
down the track

793
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,720
so

794
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,919
when you're saying about leadership

795
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,840
through chaos

796
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,679
you are demonstrating

797
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:24,159
or certainly managing through chaos to a

798
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,320
level but i think if you look within

799
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,080
yourselves as an opportunity to take it

800
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,120
to

801
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,799
one higher step

802
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,240
so at the moment i'd suggest you

803
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,600
probably in a position where a lot of

804
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,679
what you do is reactive

805
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,840
okay now if you're in a reactive state

806
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,520
that's a management state and you might

807
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,440
be and i'm not saying management is bad

808
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,039
please understand

809
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,799
but if it's in a reactive state you're

810
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,400
managing what i want you to start

811
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,440
thinking about how can you make it

812
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,360
proactive

813
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,440
how do you actually take a step back

814
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,039
sometimes

815
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,559
from the crap

816
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,880
to give an overarching perspective on

817
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,799
what is happening

818
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,720
and then start to provide some

819
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,480
predictive analysis of where do you

820
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,400
think it's going to go next

821
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,640
and if you can start to predict where it

822
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,159
might go next

823
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:10,640
now you move into a proactive state

824
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,799
now to do that you're going to initiate

825
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,840
change

826
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:16,000
now to do with be effective there you're

827
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,720
now demonstrating leadership qualities

828
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,080
and the other thing i want to challenge

829
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,039
you from

830
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,200
is move away from thinking you've only

831
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,480
your only role is to protect the

832
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,120
vertical i.t stack or maybe in the cloud

833
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,320
or whatever

834
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,159
okay start thinking to me good cyber

835
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,840
security is about driving business

836
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,600
outcomes reducing risk and growing

837
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,640
people

838
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,640
the technology is an element of that and

839
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,559
where i see great opportunity in this

840
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,039
industry is to permeate

841
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:44,480
your skills across laterally across the

842
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,919
business

843
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,320
i say to people said what is your

844
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:51,520
aspiration your your career aspiration

845
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,880
and they may say

846
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,320
i want to be a security manager i want

847
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,039
to be a sizo some not many say

848
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,799
cio

849
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,480
my challenge to you is why are you not

850
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,120
thinking about becoming the ceo

851
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,320
in this room are some of the most

852
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,840
intelligent people i've ever met with

853
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,840
the most the greatest capabilities with

854
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,080
a great empathy for people

855
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,760
and the only thing holding you back

856
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,679
sometimes is the way you perceive

857
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,440
yourself

858
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,760
so i would challenge you to look at how

859
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,320
you can add value laterally

860
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,640
okay because you deserve a seat at the

861
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,279
board table you have too much talent to

862
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,039
let the world put you in a shoebox but

863
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,120
the reality is the world is not putting

864
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,640
you in shoebox too many people are

865
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,880
putting themselves in that shoebox

866
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,559
so it might be time folks to break out

867
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:38,320
now one one tip i'd give you you're

868
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,600
going to break out

869
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,840
please develop skills around the english

870
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,360
language

871
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,440
bear with me so when i first arrived at

872
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,840
the fccg i had a peter kingsley came for

873
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,600
me peter headed up our digital forensics

874
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,159
team and peter said he came and i said

875
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,440
pete i'd like to know what you do how i

876
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,360

877
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,799
talking for about three minutes i said

878
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,080
pete do you mind doing me a favor he

879
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,520

880
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,120
go outside the door and come back in and

881
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,600
talk english and we had a laugh right he

882
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,360
said sorry boss they call us dolphins i

883
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,880
said dolphins he said yeah we're highly

884
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,039
intelligent but don't speak english

885
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,880
and we developed our own language and by

886
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,399
the end of it

887
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,559
i had we had grown the largest digital

888
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,720
forensics practice in the country

889
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,399
we need to start understanding that the

890
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,080
language of business and the language of

891
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,799
risk and the language of the board okay

892
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,360
not just the tech environments

893
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,960
failure

894
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,200
don't be afraid of it failure

895
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,279
is another step towards success thomas

896
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,520
edison said you know

897
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,200
he hasn't failed he's just tried ten

898
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,799
thousand different ways that didn't work

899
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:39,279
and that's a step towards success

900
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,039
so please don't ever be worried about

901
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:42,559
failure

902
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,559
now i remember once hearing a very

903
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:47,120
senior police leader saying

904
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,440
who didn't want to take on a new project

905
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,760
because he made this comment about

906
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,120
you know what happened to pioneers they

907
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,200
all died from arrows in the back if you

908
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,240
are a leader and you are making changes

909
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,760
there is every chance you are going to

910
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:02,240
be targeted without question

911
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,440
jealousy is a curse your peers will feel

912
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,640
inferior

913
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,320
and sometimes human nature they will

914
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,440
strike out

915
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,679
trust me i've been there it's

916
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:13,600
but it's just part of the game

917
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,440
okay therein one of the other

918
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,840
characteristics you need to be a leader

919
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,679
is to be resilient

920
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,919
life isn't fair and you can't control

921
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:24,399
other people but there are steps to try

922
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:27,360
and manage and mitigate that risk

923
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,960
so some final steps about leading

924
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,480
through chaos

925
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,679
okay

926
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,600
maintain always a calm and steady hand

927
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,640
no matter how crazy the situation is

928
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,240
never lose sight of the big picture of

929
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,399
what it's all about set your vision

930
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:41,760
values and beliefs i'm happy to make

931
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,200
these slides available if anyone wants

932
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,080
them

933
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,159
except for that video clip at the front

934
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,720
um always maintain a positive nature and

935
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,960
always have empathy for your people

936
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:53,200
you've got to be people focused

937
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,480
accept change as the normative value

938
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,440
okay bau is good for maintaining the

939
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,320
leading it's got to be change

940
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,760
and most critical is always explain the

941
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,240
why behind the change dear people

942
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,760
communicate communicate communicate

943
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,720
okay

944
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,159
now i think that would just about take

945
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,840
my time i've got 60 seconds

946
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,399
the theme of this conference

947
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,559
how often should you reflect i reflect

948
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,480
every single day i had to do this as a

949
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,919
professional executive leadership

950
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,960
program oh years ago a decade ago

951
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,679
down to mainly with charleston uni and

952
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,840
they challenged us to write a journal

953
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,200
about reflecting our thoughts now

954
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,200
getting a bunch of you know 30 40-year

955
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,120
veteran coppers to you know get all

956
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,799
emotional on paper and while they view

957
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,399
things was not an easy task at three

958
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:43,519
o'clock in the morning i'm still

959
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:44,880
struggling with it

960
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,559
and they promised us only one person

961
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:49,039
would read it so i said stuff it and i

962
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,640
did it and it spewed it out and it's

963
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,799
changed my life to a large extent i'd

964
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,960
encourage you to think about the way you

965
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,960
deal with difficult situations every

966
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,720
single day and what are the learning

967
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,840
elements from it then rethink

968
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,120
regularly

969
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,519
are you on the right path

970
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,200
don't commit something to three years

971
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,880
down the track that's really after six

972
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,960
months knows that something's not right

973
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,840
rethink regularly reskill never ever

974
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,679
stop investing in your people and never

975
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:18,000
stop investing in yourself you're worth

976
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,120
it

977
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,600
reboot as necessary

978
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,360
ladies and gentlemen thank you very much

979
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,679
i hope that uh gave you some insight i

980
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:27,440
really appreciate it thank

981
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,480
thank you

982
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,360
and thank you for absorbing some of the

983
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,000
time as well oh it's all right uh now

984
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,480
looking at the q a app i only have one

985
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,159
question as some issues are in the

986
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,840
virtual world so there's nothing to do

987
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,360
with the presentation itself just the

988
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,279
fact that people online couldn't see it

989
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,600
so hopefully that chaos is sorted now

990
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,799
um

991
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,480
are there any questions around the room

992
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,440
i have a few minutes

993
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,000
oh one over here excellent i get some

994
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,399
steps

995
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,760
thank you bro uh my question we've

996
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:05,519
talked about well you've talked about

997
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,279
chaos and leadership today so my

998
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,559
question is

999
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,799
crisis versus chaos

1000
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:14,480
and in your 33 years of experience what

1001
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,799
consistent attributes and qualities have

1002
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:17,919
you seen

1003
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:19,360
in leaders

1004
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,440
in times of crisis

1005
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,240
and i mean crisis as distinct from chaos

1006
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,679
so bushfires wars things like that thank

1007
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:28,559
you

1008
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:30,159
yeah so i'd say that

1009
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,799
chaos can control moments of crosses um

1010
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:35,440
a crisis is you want clarity normally

1011
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,919
it's a it's an operational role that's

1012
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,519
quite frankly certainly in what i've

1013
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:40,960
seen as law enforcement you've we've

1014
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,480
actually got most bases covered with

1015
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,720
your crisis from a loss of life a

1016
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,039
horrific industrial accident as you said

1017
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:51,279
a bush fire a major man hunt

1018
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,279
so crises is about normally and it's

1019
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,039
like an incident response on a larger

1020
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,880
scale you've got processes in place you

1021
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,480
have a commander control center that you

1022
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,440
default to and you actually fall into

1023
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,240
the process that is established and it's

1024
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,360
you know it's it's very particularized

1025
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,119
and you follow it almost fluently and

1026
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:11,679
automatically with chaos often i would

1027
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,760
say it sits outside the normal realm of

1028
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,440
response where you've got to innovate

1029
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:16,800
and change

1030
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,679
and you may have 6k uh crisis events to

1031
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:22,000
deal simultaneously with now 10 of your

1032
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,359
staff workload

1033
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:26,239
so you've got to be very creative

1034
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,599
i hope that makes it and as for the

1035
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,839
attributes ability to change and be

1036
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,040
flexible

1037
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,719
and prioritize on the fly and it's about

1038
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,960
forming a very quickly forming equality

1039
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,239
team with you to be able to achieve it

1040
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,159
thank you great question any other

1041
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:43,760
questions probably have a time for one

1042
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,399

1043
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,199
