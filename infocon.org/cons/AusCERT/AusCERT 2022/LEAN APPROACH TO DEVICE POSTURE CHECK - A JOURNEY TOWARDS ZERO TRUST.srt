00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,919
good morning everyone

4
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,439
so our next speaker is dashant from

5
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,039
deakin university

6
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,880
he's going to be talking today about the

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,800
challenges of providing services for

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,039
over 100 000 users where over 80 of

9
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,479
their devices are unmanaged please

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:35,120
welcome deshaun

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,920
thank you

12
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,000
well thank you for the introduction

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,680
this way sorry

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,000
um

15
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,800
what there you go um so my name is

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,719
dushant i work as a security operations

17
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,640
manager at deakin university

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,039
and i've been there for quite some time

19
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,280
now this is my 10th year

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,160
at deegan so i've been institutionalized

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,878
for a better word

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,600
so who who are we so

23
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,280
a lot of people you might have run into

24
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,680
a lot of university folks here

25
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,520
but i just wanted to take a moment to

26
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,960
acknowledge

27
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,520
the complexity of this organization so

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,720
universities are more like a mini city

29
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,479
in itself so they're very complex

30
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,680
environments

31
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,159
a hugely diverse population so we have

32
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,280
around 64 000 students

33
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,040
14 000 staff

34
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,840
across four campuses in victoria and i

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,880
believe we have about 120 buildings that

36
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,680
we run and manage

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,000
thousand managed workstations uh three

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,680
thousand plus service

39
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,560
two data centers

40
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,759
340 staff in it and only 11 in cyber

41
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,920
security uh that's including the sock

42
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,180
team which is my team

43
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:58,240
[Music]

44
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,640
so move on to the next slide so today

45
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,719
i'm going to be talking a bit about our

46
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,560
zero trust strategy

47
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,439
um how we doing device posture so

48
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,598
today's presentation is going to focus a

49
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,680
lot more on device posture

50
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,480
and is also going to talk about

51
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,400
the lessons we've learned what have we

52
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,040
done to actually get to where we are and

53
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,599
what are we planning to do next

54
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,440
so zero trust um i know this is probably

55
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,480
the fourth presentation that um

56
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,360
i've seen in in the last two days that's

57
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,120
talked about zero trust

58
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,160
and uh it's

59
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,080
it's interesting because it's not the

60
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,440
best

61
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,920
phrase out there it's not my favorite

62
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,519
if it was for me i would have said

63
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,200
something like

64
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,599
building trust or

65
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,120
something more positive because i feel

66
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,800
like zero trust has a very very negative

67
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,440
connotation but i'm not in marketing i'm

68
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,200
not making all these uh calls or

69
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,080
anyway

70
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,519
so our zero trust policy uh has actually

71
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,080
zero trucks foundation has been inspired

72
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,200
from the scissors zero trust uh

73
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,040
foundation architecture so they actually

74
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,440
have a this is still a draft stage but

75
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,040
it's a really good document i have a

76
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,440
link down at the bottom for anyone

77
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,879
interested it talks about the uh

78
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,360
the five fundamental pillars and uh the

79
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,959
architecture that's required to actually

80
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,799
get to where we need to in terms of zero

81
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,360
trust so uh in today's presentation i'm

82
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,319
going to be talking more about um

83
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:32,720
identity and device health and how we've

84
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,599
done that at the university level

85
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,200
so

86
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,080
uh this this is a also talks a bit about

87
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,760
maturity and how you actually rate

88
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,640
yourself against each of these pillars

89
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,440
so in terms of identity

90
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,560
there are three different levels of

91
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,879
maturity so there's a traditional

92
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,760
um

93
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,040
maturity there is advanced and optimal

94
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,159
so traditional is essentially where

95
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,000
you have an organization that's just

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,080
using passwords for authenticating into

97
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,319
a system there's some risk assessment on

98
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,480
understanding what are your critical

99
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,959
high-risk applications and stuff and in

100
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,720
advance you're doing

101
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,200
things like multi-factor authentication

102
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,200
you have some federated identity most

103
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,839
universities do we use australian access

104
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,120
federation

105
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,040
to interact and collaborate with other

106
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,880
universities across the board

107
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,720
and optimal is when you're actually

108
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,199
doing that extra continuous validation

109
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,520
to check if it's uh this is the right

110
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,800
user uh has the right privilege

111
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,639
is authorized to be on the system type

112
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:36,960
thing and there's uh machine learning

113
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,160
involved in understanding if it's uh

114
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,880
if the identity is not breached so i

115
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,040
have a mark there and i think roughly

116
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,040
that's where we sit we sit between

117
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,560
advanced and optimal we're not quite

118
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,479
there yet but we've done a lot of work

119
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,400
in this space to actually get to where

120
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,240
we are

121
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,160
um

122
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,360
so so we like i said we have um around

123
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,800
84 000 uh staff and students enrolled so

124
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,720
it's a it's a massive number

125
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,160
and we have around 441

126
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,800
applications last i checked and

127
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,520
the the number is a lot bigger than that

128
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,919
uh these are only applications that we

129
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:18,320
uh support and manage there are a lot of

130
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,639
other applications that use our single

131
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,720
sign-on or federated identity service

132
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,639
that we are actually supporting so it

133
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,479
could be an application that's designed

134
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,919
for students to

135
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:28,880
um

136
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,360
get you know discount coupons and stuff

137
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,039
uh so there are heaps of applications

138
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,240
that we actually don't support and

139
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,199
manage uh but this is this is what what

140
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,280
we have uh in terms of the number of

141
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,280
authentications we have in the last 30

142
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,520
days we've had 1.6 million

143
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,320
authentication requests come through

144
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,960
and of which

145
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,360
close to 90 of them use smartphone

146
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,080
devices but there's a good portion of

147
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,600
our users who actually don't use

148
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,039
smartphones

149
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,199
so we have hardware tokens and text

150
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,680
messages for them so text messages are

151
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,600
more for students we actually learned a

152
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,400
lot of text messages for staff as an mfa

153
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,600
method

154
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,560
and in terms of hardware tokens we have

155
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,720
staff and students who have

156
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,800
accessibility issues who can't use a

157
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,319
smartphone

158
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,199
we have students who are actually

159
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,400
in a

160
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,560
in in a prison in the prison

161
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,560
and can't have a phone there but they're

162
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,360
actually studying at deakin and can't

163
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,800
use the hardware token because you can't

164
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,400
take usb drives

165
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,199
so

166
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,080
it's

167
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,680
it's been really important for us to

168
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,240
make sure we provide an option for

169
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,880
multi-factor growth for every user so

170
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,560
the policy is designed so that we

171
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,479
actually don't have any exemptions so

172
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,560
everyone from the chancellor and the

173
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,199
vice chancellor through to the student

174
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,000
everyone uses mfa and it's compulsory so

175
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,840
it's designed so that you can't actually

176
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,000
exempt from the policy and there's no

177
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,840
process for exemption

178
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,280
so that's why we try and make sure that

179
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:00,160
there are enough factors available for

180
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,960
everyone to be able to uh authenticate

181
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,120
in

182
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,840
so

183
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,400
come coming more uh about today's topic

184
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,880
uh this is i'm going to be talking a lot

185
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,800
more about device trust and what we're

186
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,759
doing here so in terms of establishing

187
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,840
device trust

188
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,080
scissor talks about traditional advanced

189
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,400
and optimal stages so in traditional you

190
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,720
have very limited visibility on what

191
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,560
devices are actually

192
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,639
connecting to your network and you have

193
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,960
a very simple inventory so this could be

194
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,280
um a simple spreadsheet with a list of

195
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,039
devices that are actually

196
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,360
managed by the organization

197
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,080
um and you know it's it's not perfect

198
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,960
but it's it's something and then there's

199
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,440
the advanced uh stage where you're

200
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,919
actually doing compliance enforcement

201
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,440
for uh these devices your access depends

202
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,560
on the type of device that you're

203
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,879
connecting from uh which is where we'd

204
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,280
want to be um and that which is where

205
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,800
which is what we're doing at the moment

206
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,960
and there's also continuous monitoring

207
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,599
so constantly checking the health of the

208
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:06,639
device

209
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,280
and using advanced machine learning to

210
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,319
actually

211
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,319
do some risk-based analysis on uh

212
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,319
devices that are connecting

213
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,400
so

214
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,080
so one of the things that we had to do

215
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,599
before we actually

216
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,280
came up with this was to actually

217
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,919
prepare for uh doing device health and

218
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,280
posture so

219
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,440
we spend a lot of time trying to

220
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,520
identify the user group that we actually

221
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,440
are absolutely

222
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,000
wanting to enforce these policies on so

223
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,519
we clearly don't want to do it for

224
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,320
everyone we don't want to make it hard

225
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,640
for students to connect and study at

226
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,559
deakin especially because we actually

227
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,240
don't provide them the device that they

228
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,959
have so as long as they have

229
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,760
a basic computer with some minimum

230
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,920
specs and config they should be able to

231
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,880
study at deakin so that's the whole idea

232
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,839
and then

233
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,800
identify what is the acceptable policy

234
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,600
which

235
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,080
was a lot of exercise so we went to our

236
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:05,040
management to our support teams to all

237
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,720
the other stakeholders to actually come

238
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,120
up with a plan and come up with a policy

239
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,240
that is

240
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,880
tailored enough and works for

241
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,640
most of the use cases that we're going

242
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,160
to talk about today

243
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,040
and then the next stage was to actually

244
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,600
uh review the devices that are in that

245
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,279
are potentially going to be impacted so

246
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,399
since we're doing a lot of audit to see

247
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,600
who's connecting where they're

248
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,200
connecting from what's a device that

249
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,399
they're using

250
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,560
um we've basically

251
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,399
done a lot of review to understand who's

252
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,399
going to be impacted so the change

253
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,440
management becomes a lot more easier

254
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,800
and then making sure uh since university

255
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,519
environments are huge we try and uh get

256
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,839
to a self-service type

257
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:50,560
troubleshooting

258
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,000
scenario where we are actually not

259
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,600
relying on

260
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,760
users calling up service desk or service

261
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:58,320
support every time they have an issue

262
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,240
but they're actually being able they're

263
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,959
able to support themselves

264
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,279
um so this is what the policy uh

265
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:11,040
actually can do so we use uh duo uh for

266
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,880
our multi-factor auth uh as a

267
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,200
multi-factor oauth provider and they

268
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,640
actually have a few uh extra bells and

269
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,320
whistles to be able to do divisive in

270
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,399
posture so we thought why not you know

271
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,320
this is a great start

272
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,640
so what this actually does is you can

273
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,640
see the screenshot that

274
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,959
essentially talks about both that's the

275
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,279
mac version of it and that's the windows

276
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,920
version sorry the other way around

277
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,200
and

278
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,480
it captures information like location so

279
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,160
where the user is connecting from so

280
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,000
both location of the

281
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,320
computer or a workstation that they are

282
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,120
logging in from and location of the

283
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,200
multi-factor loads device so if you are

284
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,680
if your device location is in in a

285
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,160
different country and your mfa location

286
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,920
is in a different country that's an

287
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,240
anomaly so we're trying to understand

288
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,320
what's acceptable there so we capture

289
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,079
all of that information we look at

290
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,959
operating system versions so uh that's a

291
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,800
really interesting thing as well i'll

292
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,720
dwell into that in a in a sec uh we have

293
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,040
browser versions plugins installed on

294
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,399
the browser so

295
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,959
uh browsers have become a sort of an

296
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,720
operating system in them themselves so

297
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,519
there's uh add-ons and plugins so

298
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,440
whatever you can install on the browser

299
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,320
and most staff and students

300
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,640
purely interact with deakin services

301
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,480
just through the browser so securing

302
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:37,279
that is really important for us as well

303
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,000
and uh doing things like disk encryption

304
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,399
was has also been uh an interesting

305
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,720
thing an important thing for us uh

306
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,600
because we have a lot of people who have

307
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,079
been more mobile than they used to be so

308
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,279
we used to have uh only about 60 of all

309
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,240
staff

310
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,639
having a portable workstation uh now

311
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,480
that's slowly creeped up to 90 in the

312
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,680
last two years because we want um

313
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,160
our staff to be more mobile than they

314
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,000
used to be in the past

315
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,240
and uh then you know understanding

316
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,040
passive policies and login policies on

317
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,519
the workstation so this tells us that as

318
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,639
well and

319
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,480
the version of the agent that's running

320
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,240
on it so just making sure that we don't

321
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,320
have an updated agent running on the

322
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,959
workstation

323
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,920
so um policy this is where the

324
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,360
conversation always gets really

325
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,360
interesting in universities so every

326
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,200
time you talk about policy everyone has

327
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,920
their own perspective so our leadership

328
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,880
is like you know dial up security policy

329
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,079
let's go as secure as possible then

330
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:41,839
we look at the impact and we're like oh

331
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:44,160
no we need to dial down so you need to

332
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,320
get that right otherwise often what i've

333
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,399
seen in universities is

334
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:50,880
you have a very stringent security

335
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,760
policy and then there's

336
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,320
some research team or a major chunk of

337
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,000
the organization gets impacted because

338
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,320
of that security policy and there's a

339
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
massive scare and we dial it down so

340
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,000
much that it it's almost non-existent so

341
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,839
it's really important you get that right

342
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,839
and the way we've actually done this is

343
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,519
we've come up with three separate

344
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,240
policies so we've we have a policy for

345
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,399
uh just doing an audit so we have a few

346
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,720
alerts that we've set up uh purely based

347
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,680
on the information that we are

348
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,120
collecting from all our staff and

349
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,639
students

350
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,200
and we look at we have some playbooks

351
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,760
that look at anomalies like where's the

352
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,680
user logging in from uh is has the user

353
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,639
have does the user have multiple uh

354
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:37,040
devices that they are using for mfa so

355
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,920
we've identified a student recently

356
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,320
who had eight mobile devices connected

357
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,560
to the same account that's unusual like

358
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,120
two devices i'll take it eight devices

359
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,560
that's that's more than how much money

360
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,720
they'd be paying for their fee uh just

361
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,360
on um you know telephone bill so it's

362
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,839
really important to understand uh what

363
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,600
your thresholds are so we have a few

364
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,560
playbooks uh catered for that and then

365
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,639
we have a baseline policy for all staff

366
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:03,440
so

367
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,160
when we first went from

368
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,320
uh working from home i'm not going to

369
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,240
use the word pandemic but working from

370
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,440
home

371
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,839
we ended up in situations where

372
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,519
staff were

373
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,519
just going back home and using the

374
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,360
workstation that was already set up on

375
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,240
there

376
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,800
in their study or at home and they're

377
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,480
not actually not they didn't bother

378
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,880
plugging in their university workstation

379
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,800
so we ended up in situations where we

380
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,760
had

381
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,320
users with privileged access access to

382
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,519
critical

383
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,079
infrastructure logging in from windows 7

384
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,800
windows xp devices so that's not really

385
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,600
ideal for us and we wanted to make sure

386
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,920
we have a baseline policy to say you

387
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,839
cannot be using a windows xp device

388
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,240
anymore so we've set up a baseline

389
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,720
policy that's for all staff and that's

390
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,040
uh that's reasonable quite reasonable

391
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,600
it's not insane to expect that

392
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,320
and then we have a more stricter policy

393
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,720
for enforcement so this is more our

394
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,160
privileged users and when i say

395
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,320
privileged i'm talking about everyone

396
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,199
from i.t admins to people with financial

397
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,120
delegation who can actually

398
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,079
who

399
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,480
the organization has trusted with

400
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,040
uh with the organization's money so it's

401
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,720
also important that we make sure that we

402
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,360
provide extra security to those users

403
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,000
and users who are working on critical uh

404
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,839
research so

405
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,680
that's the enforcement policy we've had

406
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,560
so

407
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,040
which is uh which is quite stricter so

408
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,399
we'll go through that in a sec

409
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,079
so this is how the interface actually

410
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,839
looks like so you have uh when you log

411
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,000
into any deakin web application you are

412
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,800
presented with a single sign-on page

413
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,399
and you log in with your username and

414
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,959
password prompts you for mfa like every

415
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,160
other organization does and once you've

416
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,480
once you've done your mfa challenge it

417
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,600
just it then transparently so so the

418
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,800
user would not know that this is

419
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,279
happening in the background would send

420
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,600
health and posture information

421
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,480
based on a client that's installed or

422
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,839
the information that the browser is

423
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,160
collecting on your behalf anyway so you

424
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,440
don't have to

425
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,519
unless you are on an enforcement policy

426
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:14,800
you don't have to have the client

427
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,600
installed but it will prompt you uh time

428
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,120
and again to say

429
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,880
hey you know do you want to install this

430
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,639
client do you want this extra security

431
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,480
have this client installed but if the

432
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,079
policy is enforced you don't have a

433
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,279
choice you need to have the client

434
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,800
installed we need to get all the

435
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,240
information we need

436
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,839
so

437
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:34,079
mostly transparent but if you actually

438
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:34,959
have

439
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,199
a policy that you're not complying with

440
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,519
there's some self-service tips that come

441
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:40,480
up

442
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,720
on a pop-up so in this

443
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,800
screenshot on the left it talks about

444
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,639
firewall status so the os firewall

445
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,839
for this windows workstation is disabled

446
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,880
and the user got an alert to say uh fix

447
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,360
this click click here fix this firewall

448
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,120
enable firewall and then you're able to

449
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,120
log back in again so it's fairly

450
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,440
straightforward you don't even need

451
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,839
kb articles and stuff to

452
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,480
advise your staff or your students on

453
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,839
how to use this

454
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,160
and on the right you can see that

455
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,000
there's there's a pop-up that comes up

456
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,119
if prompting you to say hey you know

457
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,880
you've not

458
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,880
updated your browser your browser looks

459
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,119
very fairly out of date do you want to

460
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,839
do that so this is more uh an audit

461
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,919
policy so it actually prompts you to do

462
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,000
something but it actually not doesn't

463
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,160
stop you from doing what you're doing

464
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,559
but when we actually start enforcing

465
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:35,600
we're saying

466
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,320
hey you actually do have a really old

467
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,440
browser

468
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,840
and you can't log in unless you update

469
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,679
that and browser updates are quite

470
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,360
simple all you have to do is restart the

471
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,640
browser

472
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,320
in most cases at least

473
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,360
so

474
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,679
that's that's really important making it

475
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,679
transparent making sure you're not

476
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,160
adding extra hurdles

477
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,000
is really important otherwise you'll end

478
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,240
up in situations where people will see

479
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,280
this

480
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,360
as an extra hurdle or a hoop to jump

481
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:07,120
through every time they need to log in

482
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,000
um

483
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,440
going back a bit about

484
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,440
what our network actually looks like so

485
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,080
we will we'll talk a bit about uh the

486
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,679
type of devices that we're doing this

487
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,760
device health and posture for in a sec

488
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,480
but before that i just wanted to

489
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,600
show this graph and and talk about how

490
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,559
diverse the environment is so we have

491
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:31,520
a lot of iots and sensors so so the

492
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,320
number of workstations currently

493
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,400
connected to the network is generally

494
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,640
not this low we uh

495
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,120
our on-campus activity is not

496
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,200
back to where it needs to be or it used

497
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,720
to be

498
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,280
but we you can see the number of iot

499
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,520
devices on the network as well and

500
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,000
securing them are also really important

501
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,080
uh for today's presentation i'm gonna

502
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,480
predominantly talk about this these two

503
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:59,360
bits so the workstation and mobile

504
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,919
devices uh securing them along with all

505
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,559
the byod devices that connect as well so

506
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,200
this policy is agnostic of where you're

507
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,600
actually located so doesn't really care

508
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,640
if you are uh on deakin's network or off

509
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,280
deakin's network so it just ensures that

510
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,120
you're connecting from a secure device

511
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,280
irrespective of where you're connecting

512
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,400
from

513
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,840
um

514
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,360
so this is what we did at the start we

515
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,880
wanted to understand what we are

516
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,400
actually dealing with

517
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,720
so we looked at the number of endpoints

518
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,919
that we

519
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,600
um that are currently going through our

520
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,039
audit policy that we are actually

521
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,520
looking in capturing this telemetry and

522
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,919
information from so we have close to 100

523
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,320
000 uh end points that we've seen in the

524
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,760
last 30 days and you can see when we

525
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,640
actually started doing this

526
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,320
before we started kicking off some of

527
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,240
these people or getting them to do their

528
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,360
updates there were 1.4

529
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,640
000 or 1400 devices that were end of

530
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:59,200
life so end of life and endless support

531
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,880
means that they are either running a

532
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,280
really old version of windows 10 or

533
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,280
windows 7 windows 8.1 i had nine windows

534
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,360
xp users that were connecting to our

535
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,960
services i didn't even know that was a

536
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,559
thing i didn't really i didn't even

537
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,000
realize that browsers would actually

538
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,200
work

539
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,280
i thought it was long dead but clearly

540
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,679
not and then we had a lot of mac os

541
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,039
devices that were old functional but

542
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,080
um apple wouldn't provide further uh

543
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,400
releases and updates so we were in a

544
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,640
situation where we're like what do we do

545
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,159
with these devices

546
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:34,960
and that's sort of some metrics on how

547
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,120
many byo devices we're dealing with so

548
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,280
we're dealing with three quarters of our

549
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,159
all the devices connecting to uh deakin

550
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:43,440
applications

551
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,320
have all been using uh bvio devices and

552
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,280
and not

553
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,760
a lot of them are actually non-compliant

554
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,679
so we need to understand what we look

555
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:54,320
for um and and how we actually enforce

556
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,880
these policies so

557
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,480
um

558
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,559
moving on to the next slide so this is

559
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:03,039
just an example of the the amount of

560
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,640
information that we actually gather

561
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,400
through this um

562
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,720
this posture check so you can actually

563
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,520
see

564
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,640
at the top

565
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,960
you get some information about the user

566
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,960
the workstation and the version of the

567
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,320
operating system that they're connecting

568
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,360
from so for all uh deakin managed

569
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,000
workstations we actually have a

570
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,919
a trusted device check so we know if

571
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,000
it's a managed device or an unmanaged

572
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,760
device so

573
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,440
a security team actually didn't care

574
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,520
about it this as much we actually don't

575
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,840
have a policy that says you can do these

576
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,760
activities only on a managed device and

577
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,919
these you can't so

578
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,000
this was more to just get an

579
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,520
understanding and get a feel of it

580
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,919
because our support teams we're not

581
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,840
really aware of how many managed devices

582
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,600
there are there so we had good

583
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,679
statistics on

584
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,840
how many devices were actually

585
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,559
owned by the university but not all

586
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,320
university-owned devices were actually

587
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,880
managed people did their own thing

588
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,559
so getting those numbers were really

589
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,200
good we started targeting those users uh

590
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
tapping on their shoulders to say hey

591
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,600
you know why you not using a

592
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,760
deakin managed operating system on your

593
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,480
workstation so research especially we've

594
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,320
identified a lot of users where that's

595
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,120
that was the case and we've converted as

596
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,280
many as we could it's still work in

597
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,120
progress we're not there yet and i'm

598
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,559
sure most universities are going to

599
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,799
struggle with that but it was good for

600
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,960
us to just get an idea of how many

601
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,200
managed workstations we had

602
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,960
so that's the certificate that actually

603
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,840
does the check for managed and unmanaged

604
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,760
this is browser information so we have

605
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,159
we use cisco anyconnect as a vpn

606
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,240
solution and that's also treated as a

607
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,240
browser because we use single sign-on on

608
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,400
top of cisco and every time you single

609
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,720
sign-on it comes up as uh any connectors

610
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,799
your app connecting and that's the

611
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,880
user's primary uh browser that they're

612
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,960
connecting from so you can see that you

613
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,120
know there are plugins uninstalled which

614
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,360
is good that they don't have flash java

615
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,159
working which we flagged as high risk

616
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,720
plugins and we don't want uh users to be

617
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,640
using that because we don't have a lot

618
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:08,640
of applications or most our applications

619
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,720
don't use either those those two plugins

620
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,360
or don't require those two plugins

621
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,880
and this is a bit more information that

622
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,640
you get from the client that's actually

623
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,360
installed on your workstation so for

624
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,240
users who we've enforced this policy on

625
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,320
if they don't have the client installed

626
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,280
the single sign-on prompt essentially uh

627
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,799
comes up with the pop-up and tells you

628
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,760
how to install the client so you do it

629
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,919
as you're logging in to your workstation

630
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,600
for the first time

631
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:37,039
but this is all the information that we

632
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:41,360
collect which we talked about just then

633
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,720
so then

634
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,240
came the fun part

635
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,320
enforcement

636
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,960
our service support area hates us every

637
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,480
time we say the word enforcement they

638
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,240
freak out they're like we don't want

639
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,400
more user disruption but

640
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,240
i think we've done pretty well with our

641
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,120
first enforcement area we've done that

642
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,039
for our own it staff and we've had two

643
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,360
users who've had issues when we pushed

644
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,919
out the policy so the the impact was

645
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,440
quite low

646
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,640
um

647
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,640
so the first thing we did was we only

648
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,679
communicated to the people that we know

649
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,000
we're going to be impacted so we did

650
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:18,880
some

651
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,919
wider comps uh had newsletters and stuff

652
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,760
but the moment you actually tell someone

653
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,080
that there is a massive id change even

654
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,919
if it doesn't impact them

655
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,520
they're going to start getting worried

656
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,880
they're going to start ringing up i.t

657
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,440
they're like hey am i impacted what's

658
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,720
happening with me what's happening with

659
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,279
my device so we wanted to avoid that by

660
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,320
just doing some a lot of targeted comps

661
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,480
and that really helped

662
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,760
we also

663
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,520
provided

664
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,760
a lot of kbs and articles and

665
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,600
newsletters and stuff we have a an

666
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,679
amazing communications

667
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,679
team that is done that has put and

668
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,080
helped us with this

669
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,919
putting these things together

670
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,240
and we also had a process for dealing

671
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,039
with exemptions so normally we don't do

672
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,760
this it's unlike

673
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,159
having an exemption policy in securities

674
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,480
is not something that we would do within

675
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,600
the team

676
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,559
but we had a few issues i'll get into

677
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,960
the challenges in a sec but we've had a

678
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,760
few issues where we had to deal with

679
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,360
exemptions

680
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,520
where it wouldn't necessarily work for a

681
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,840
few use cases so we did come up with a

682
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,120
policy we don't advertise this but we

683
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,200
know it's there if in case someone is

684
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,640
stuck and they need to be able to log in

685
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,640
and we also when we actually do have an

686
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,799
exemption process we generally have

687
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:40,960
exemptions for a limited period of time

688
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,039
so we made sure that the process was

689
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,080
built such that you only get exemptions

690
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,799
for you know a month so for instance you

691
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,799
are in a situation where

692
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,559
you've ordered for a new workstation

693
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,480
you're a new staff member got a new

694
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,919
workstation and the workstation is stuck

695
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,320
with all the logistical shipping issues

696
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,080
that we have so you're using your

697
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,480
unsecured device at the moment so we

698
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,480
provide you with some exemption to be

699
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,159
able to do that

700
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,799
we support as best as we can but we you

701
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,640
need to do what you need to do

702
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,240
um but that's not going to be an

703
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,880
exemption forever so we actually ensure

704
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,880
that um that's time boxed and uh

705
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,120
that's it and

706
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,039
one yeah so

707
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,720
this is where it gets interesting again

708
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,279
um so lessons learned so

709
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,200
we've um

710
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,279
we've like i said we've identified that

711
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,240
there is a lot more byo devices that

712
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,480
staff are using than what we had

713
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,520
anticipated um a lot of their deakin

714
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,600
owned devices were just

715
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,679
sitting there in the cupboard not turned

716
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:48,640
on not used because they have a

717
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,960
a cool desktop with led lights or

718
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,360
whatever that's already connected but

719
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,880
that stated so

720
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,080
um

721
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,760
and we've also had issues with software

722
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,600
that we've had extended support for that

723
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,360
our device health and posture would not

724
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,640
take into account

725
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,159
so for instance firefox extended support

726
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,640
versions of firefox is a good example

727
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,640
the version numbers are old we're just

728
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,559
looking at version numbers to determine

729
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,520
if it's

730
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,399
a supported and a secure browser or not

731
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:21,200
so

732
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,679
we had a few people running esr version

733
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:26,880
of firefox that we had to switch them to

734
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,440
a public release of firefox as well so

735
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,320
we had a few of those cases where we

736
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,600
didn't know that they were actually

737
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,440
getting extended support for the

738
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,960
operating system and device that they

739
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,159
were using

740
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:39,600
um

741
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,320
and uh initial login was another problem

742
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,840
so we've moved to

743
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,399
uh in tune deployment for windows and

744
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,080
we're doing the we're doing something

745
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,399
similar using microsoft identity to log

746
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:51,279
into

747
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,000
mac os when they're first provisioned

748
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,039
and we had a bit of a catch-22 situation

749
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,360
so when you're logging in to your device

750
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,960
for the first time

751
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,279
the policy on your identity says you

752
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,039
need to have a

753
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,799
a health app running in the background

754
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,960
to give all the health information but

755
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,320
the health app will only kick in after

756
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,440
you log in

757
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,840
so what do you do there so we were stuck

758
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,559
in situations where we had some

759
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,600
processes that wouldn't work because

760
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,960
the health app would just not kick in

761
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,200
and some desktop applications that used

762
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,120
an embedded browser of some shape or

763
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,440
form didn't play really well

764
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,840
um they were not a full-fledged browser

765
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,240
sitting within the application not going

766
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,159
to name any applications but we had some

767
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,080
desktop apps that didn't play quite

768
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,480
nicely it's it's still relatively new

769
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,399
technology so

770
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:47,200
it's still a lot of room for maturity in

771
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,760
that space

772
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,720
so one of the things that we've been

773
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,679
getting asked from our management is

774
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,360
it's great you're doing all these things

775
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,600
but how do you actually measure your

776
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,760
progress how do you measure success on

777
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,279
these things is it 100 compliance but

778
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,880
that's often not the case that's not the

779
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,799
only metrics that tells us we've done

780
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:11,360
this well we've done we've hit the nail

781
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,919
on this so a couple of things that we

782
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,360
constantly reported back to our

783
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,360
management uh with this particular

784
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,279
initiative was we talked about how

785
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,200
frictionless the end user experience was

786
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,520
so we got some stats on the number of

787
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,360
calls that we got for

788
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,640
um

789
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,799
to for our support teams the number of

790
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,200
escalations that we've had to deal with

791
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,679
uh for this which were quite low

792
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,760
um and the number of security incidents

793
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,039
overall so we uh looked at uh instances

794
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,720
where we actually had to

795
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,000
uh to um like deal with compromised

796
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,880
workstations scanning re-imaging those

797
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,760
workstation time spent on dealing with

798
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,840
those workstations so that have gone

799
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,080
down as well so we've measured on that

800
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,039
as well

801
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,640
and the other thing we had was um

802
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,279
this this is something that is important

803
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,440
and interesting to me so we are a very

804
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,640
lean team

805
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,720
and we often have to be careful on how

806
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,960
we are actually spending our time so one

807
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,039
of the things that i often ask myself

808
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,600
when i ask others in the team as well is

809
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,279
the time that you're actually spending

810
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,120
in maintaining this technology and

811
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,440
maintenance tool to the actual time that

812
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,960
you're spending and responding to the

813
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,600
incident is it like we have only two

814
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,960
incidents

815
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,679
once every year and we've spent

816
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,360
three months just getting this up and

817
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,360
running if that's the case it's actually

818
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,000
not worth it so we made sure that this

819
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,440
was actually

820
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,399
going to

821
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,559
be of of business value and this is

822
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,520
where

823
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,520
we needed to spend our time

824
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,840
so and also

825
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,240
it's like i said before it's really

826
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,679
important that we

827
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,559
ensure that uh the login

828
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,600
does not change so the login experience

829
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,240
does not change so all of this has been

830
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,919
quite transparent for uh close to 99 of

831
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,080
our users there were a couple that were

832
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,640
anomalies that needed to do a few things

833
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,360
to fix their workstation to update their

834
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,600
device or do what they needed to but

835
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,279
majority of them it was quite

836
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,559
transparent

837
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,320
so that that was really important

838
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,960
metrics as well

839
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,480
and yeah so we talked about the first

840
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,399
two pillars there's a lot more to zero

841
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,799
trust we have been doing a lot of other

842
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:25,760
initiatives uh along this uh

843
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,640
con

844
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,880
along this vision i i would say it's not

845
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,640
it's not i would say it's much bigger

846
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,960
than a framework zero trust for us is

847
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,799
more like a vision where we want to get

848
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:37,039
to so we're doing a lot of work in the

849
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:39,760
network environment space so we have

850
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,320
micro segmentations within data centers

851
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,360
and

852
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,120
although we have a flat access layer

853
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,000
network we don't get users to

854
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,320
jump on the network without having to do

855
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,200
the proper authentication and ensuring

856
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,480
that they're authorized to be on the

857
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,000
network

858
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,760
we have my colleague

859
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,840
here is can talk a bit more about this

860
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,279
but we've been doing a lot of work with

861
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:02,000
our

862
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,480
applications team as well building that

863
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,440
uh embedding security into application

864
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,600
development so it actually becomes a

865
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,559
part of security uh building and we're

866
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,799
also looking at data on how we consume

867
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,360
data so universities are also notorious

868
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,840
to not have great data classification

869
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,880
standards

870
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,559
so that's also something that we're

871
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:25,120
looking at along with all the

872
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,360
automation and governance that's it sit

873
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,840
as foundation for all of these

874
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,720
so

875
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,039
i think that's it for me

876
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:34,720
and thanks to everyone in the team

877
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,240
because

878
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,840
all this would not have been possible

879
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,880
with

880
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,320
the team and everyone else that has

881
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,000
supported security so far in the

882
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,240
organization so i just want to take a

883
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,159
moment to thank everyone

884
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,240
and yeah that's it for me yeah have it

885
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,519
around with paul

886
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:51,840
thank you

887
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,360
thanks shashank we've got lots of

888
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,279
questions and i guess the common theme

889
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:58,559
of the questions is to do with the

890
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,720
technology stack you're using to support

891
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,960
your operation so um

892
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,720
you've given though i guess some answers

893
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,840
to a few of these already with the use

894
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,919
of intune and i guess other mdm type

895
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,760
stuff for the osx things but you've got

896
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,080
to talk about that yeah so

897
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,760
we actually do apply some of these

898
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,000
policies to our cloud native

899
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,159
environments as well so we also have

900
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,559
remote desktops and stuff that people

901
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,240
connect to we have students that we

902
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,640
provide a vdi environment for so these

903
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,039
policies and stuff are also applied on

904
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:31,279
those environments as well

905
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,679
so we're trying to expand it as much as

906
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,000
we could but majority of what we do is

907
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,600
still on-prem so on-prem security is

908
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,080
still quite front and center for us

909
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,320
and yes we've also

910
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,200
looked at microsoft in tune

911
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,320
the flexibility that this gave us was

912
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,399
being able to support all the b vio

913
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:53,919
devices that are not going through in

914
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:56,080
turn and the diversity of devices that

915
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,399
it actually supports so we've been doing

916
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,399
uh something similar for mobile devices

917
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,679
as well so ios android uh mac os and

918
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,919
stuff and it's it's part of the

919
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:07,679
authentication process so this your

920
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,679
students or staff shouldn't need to do

921
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,079
anything more

922
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:14,320
yeah great um

923
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,760
another question someone messaged me

924
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,159
before is like uh a common problem that

925
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,320
especially in academia is that keeping

926
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,320
finding and retaining good staff and

927
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,560
yeah how do you approach that

928
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,719
um it's funny it's also a challenge for

929
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,280
us i'm sure it's for everyone else

930
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,719
we shouldn't be saying that because

931
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,839
we're actually an educational

932
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,719
institution so we should be solving the

933
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,639
problem but not talking about the

934
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,159
problem

935
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,879
what i can definitely tell is we have a

936
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,520
very strong internship program now

937
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,280
so we've been working very closely with

938
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,719
our school of yt

939
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:49,040
for the first couple of years we've had

940
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,199
interns it was quite difficult for us

941
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,599
because uh they were all uh offensive

942
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,719
security

943
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,440
uh

944
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:58,400
type interns that came through so

945
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,839
they essentially that's all they learned

946
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:02,320
in their bachelor's or master's degree

947
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,560
so they spent three two two three years

948
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,079
just learning offensive security they

949
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,520
had no idea what defending or what blue

950
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,520
teaming is going to look like so we've

951
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,240
been feeding back to our school we work

952
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,400
working closely collaborating with them

953
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,800
in shaping the curriculum so

954
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,760
the students have a much wider breadth

955
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,480
of subjects that they're exposed to

956
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,240
so hopefully we'll

957
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,599
solve this one day

958
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,040
yeah

959
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,079
i really like your um i guess

960
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,000
your threat hunting really for the users

961
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,839
who are registering like eight or nine

962
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:37,760
devices yeah that's pretty good is that

963
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,440
an automatic detection was that like a

964
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,520
manual thing that you've uh automatic

965
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,960
for what sorry is that something you

966
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,640
detect automatically now or you actually

967
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,560
manually have to go through and uh

968
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,359
detect users who have multiple

969
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,880
media we actually have playbooks that

970
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,119
we've written for it so

971
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:55,119
we actually have some responses that are

972
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:56,480
automatic but

973
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,560
the alerts itself are manually triaged

974
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,359
by the security analysts in the team so

975
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,920
um often it's it's an interesting case

976
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,640
we've found very little uh instances

977
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:10,000
where there was actual malicious intent

978
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,800
but

979
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,400
there are definitely cases where we

980
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,800
respond to very quickly and automate for

981
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,520
instance if there is a a sysad main and

982
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,079
all of a sudden outside of business eyes

983
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,720
uh there's a new mfa device that was

984
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,880
registered against their account that's

985
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,800
something that we you know lock and

986
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,160
respond to quite quickly um so we trying

987
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,599
to do a few more of those checks and

988
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,920
bonuses it's it's a moving target the

989
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,760
other problem we've had with all of this

990
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,079
is uh when you send a push notification

991
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,079
to people and if you're doing that more

992
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,520
often than you should

993
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,480
um

994
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,320
people are going to get be numb to the

995
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,680
notification that's actually coming

996
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,680
through so we've had instances where

997
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,599
staff would just get a notification

998
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,079
random out of the blue and they'd say

999
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,200
yes that's me log me in so

1000
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,440
it's not as effective so you have to

1001
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,440
make sure that like i said you need to

1002
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,760
dial that properly the security policy

1003
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,119
properly

1004
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,560
