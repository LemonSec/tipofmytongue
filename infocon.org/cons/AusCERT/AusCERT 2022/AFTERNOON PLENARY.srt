1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,640
well welcome back ladies and gentlemen

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,319
trust you enjoyed your afternoon tea saw

3
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,680
a couple of people wandering in with the

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,519
schooners out of the combi keg situation

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:10,880
we've got set up for you there so we're

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,960
enjoying afternoon tea hope you really

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,880
enjoyed the parallel streams as well

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,039
don't forget if you are missed something

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,240
during the course of the day or if

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,439
there's two things you would rather go

11
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:20,640
to at the same time obviously you can't

12
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,680
etc

13
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,199
all of the content generated in the

14
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,439
conference exists on the on air platform

15
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,199
for i think it's three months after the

16
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,960
conference then goes to youtube as well

17
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,720
so if you miss something or want to take

18
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,399
in it again make sure you do use that

19
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,040
facility we've got three short sharp

20
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,559
keynotes for you this afternoon before

21
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,160
we wrap up and start to prepare for our

22
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,360
gala dinner we're about to hear from the

49
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,720
uh information security program at the

50
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,479
australian national university

51
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,720
sothogracy ratnam anu's iso was

52
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,320
scheduled to attend but was

53
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,840
unfortunately unable to make it and he

54
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,600
sends his apologies

55
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,439
like it says on the tin

56
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:49,680
i am here to talk about the anu data

57
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,799
breach specifically what came next and

58
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,479
the generational shift on our horizon

59
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:58,880
the anu was established in 1946 we're

60
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,119
ranked 20th in size for australian

61
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:03,280
universities but number one in the world

62
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,040
university rankings

63
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,640
a major focus of our mission as a

64
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,639
university is to conduct research which

65
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,959
transforms society and creates national

66
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,400
capability

67
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,840
we're also a commonwealth government

68
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,840
authority we seek to be that bridge

69
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,480
between research academia governance and

70
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,680
policy

71
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,520
this designation also means that we are

72
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,200
subject to additional scrutiny and

73
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,720
regulation

74
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,560
and the entire higher education sector

75
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,520
has just been made critical

76
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,319
infrastructure which is fun

77
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,040
the anu has an annual turnover of 1.3

78
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,680
billion dollars 4 500 staff and roughly

79
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,360
20 000 students

80
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,959
and we are a target

81
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,440
every day every second every click just

82
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,840
like many of you

83
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,400
in november 2018 a spearfishing email

84
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,160
kicked off a campaign that would lead to

85
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,680
a breach of the anu's administrative

86
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,959
systems

87
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,720
as our vice chancellor put it this

88
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,879
wasn't a smash and grab it was a diamond

89
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,040
heist it's likely they spent months

90
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,360
gathering intel on anu and planning the

91
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,400
attack

92
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,239
they used custom-built malware and

93
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,080
zero-day hacks to exploit unknown

94
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,400
vulnerabilities in our systems

95
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,920
and they dismantled their operations as

96
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,480
they went to cover their tracks

97
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,319
the breach comprised of three main

98
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:14,560
elements the attackers used multiple

99
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,480
spear phishing campaigns to try and gain

100
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,879
credentials targeting elevated

101
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,840
privileges in particular

102
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,040
once they got on the network they

103
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,720
started stiffing for more

104
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,480
the attackers built a shadow

105
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,440
ecosystem of compromised anu machines

106
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,680
tools and network connections and from

107
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,519
this they built their mapping and attack

108
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:34,959
stations

109
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:36,560
and finally

110
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,480
the attackers used a variety of methods

111
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,840
to extract

112
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,840
stolen data and credentials via email

113
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,360
and other compromised anu systems

114
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,080
if you want to know more about the how

115
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,840
of the data breach you can find it in

116
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,159
the public report that anu published the

117
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,920
report is the culmination of months of

118
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,920
investigation into the hack it outlines

119
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,080
the incredible level of sophistication

120
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,239
behind it as well as a detailed timeline

121
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,159
of what happened and when

122
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,000
in fact it was during this investigation

123
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,360
that we found a second attack and

124
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,040
disrupted it

125
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,720
the report was made public for a number

126
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,400
of important reasons

127
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,879
to offer transparency to our community

128
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,879
to take ownership of our weaknesses and

129
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,880
to make a public promise to do better to

130
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,040
not let this happen again

131
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,759
and importantly to encourage disclosure

132
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,240
of these types of attacks more broadly

133
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,040
as our vc put it i want my pain to be

134
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,960
your gain so that we know what we are up

135
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,560
against

136
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,000
we wanted to encourage the practice of

137
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,080
an early warning system

138
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,240
we've had we've carried this theme into

139
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,240
the selection criteria of the tools that

140
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,560
we implement tools that feed threat

141
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,199
intelligence detected in one environment

142
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,560
back into the machine learning to

143
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,400
protect the rest of the environment are

144
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,919
going to have a greater protection long

145
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,199
term

146
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,880
as an aside the breach report has been

147
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,880
translated into four languages including

148
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,560
russian and mandarin and is on the dark

149
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,720
web as a training tool it is important

150
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,560
to note because i have been asked before

151
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,280
this wasn't done by us

152
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,199
the two attacks were an act of

153
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,600
organizational trauma a violation that

154
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,840
robbed us of the trust that we had in

155
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,919
our systems and our processes and in our

156
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:10,880
people

157
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,479
but it was also a singular point of

158
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,680
clarity

159
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,440
the university had to take a sharp right

160
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,520
turn overnight into a new security

161
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,000
posture and start the rapid uphill climb

162
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
to get anu secure

163
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,680
this was the new normal

164
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,160
the focus and the risk of the breaches

165
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,000
also gave us an opportunity to surge

166
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,080
resources to gain control and had

167
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,919
decision makers listening when we called

168
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,440
for change

169
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,199
after the first breach a ciso was

170
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,720
appointed who reports directly to the

171
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,280
vice-chancellor once he was installed he

172
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,199
started gathering anyone at the anu who

173
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,880
knew the systems and how to protect them

174
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,720
into a task force

175
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,280
where we had gaps and we had many we had

176
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,919
found industry partners to assist

177
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,520
from that the information security

178
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,600
office was born

179
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,759
as an entity we have one goal to keep

180
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,479
amu safe and credible the focus of our

181
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,719
efforts is entirely on the anu community

182
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,280
we don't have all the answers we haven't

183
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,039
even finished asking ourselves all of

184
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,960
the questions but we've learned a few

185
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,240
things that might be of interest to you

186
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,479
today

187
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,479
a couple of slides back i mentioned the

188
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,000
attackers leveraged unknown

189
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,240
vulnerabilities in our systems

190
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,160
the vulnerabilities were unknown because

191
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,560
our systems weren't well documented well

192
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,880
controlled or well understood

193
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,440
this was not the result of malice more a

194
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,759
lack of prioritization high workloads

195
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,759
focused on user needs

196
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,919
and a situation where the small gains

197
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:35,520
weren't keeping up with the evolving

198
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,880
threat

199
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,039
and we're not alone in this companies

200
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:40,479
around the world have reported that a

201
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,240
lack of visibility

202
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,400
of what is in their environment is a can

203
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,199
of worms they're too afraid to open

204
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,039
much like the theme of this conference

205
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,960
we needed to rethink reskill and reboot

206
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,720
the university needed to rethink its

207
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,120
priorities our assumptions about what

208
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,880
was on our network and how it was being

209
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,680
used the current and future environments

210
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,680
and the functions we actually needed to

211
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,880
serve

212
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,400
we also needed to better understand what

213
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,759
normal looked like so that we could

214
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,240
detect suspicious behavior

215
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,240
we needed to re-skill to uplift

216
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,240
capabilities not just of our support

217
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,560
staff but of all of our users

218
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,560
and our processes and our tools and

219
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,400
technology

220
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,240
while establishing career clear

221
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,720
priorities is critical that was the easy

222
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,199
part we're in the uplift phase now

223
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:28,960
laying the groundwork for the

224
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,680
future-proof next phase

225
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,680
for us the reboot phase is a

226
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,599
generational shift to zero trust

227
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,440
principles in our environment

228
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,840
this includes a new network an overhaul

229
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,919
of identity management and the removal

230
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,680
of passwords on our core systems

231
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,280
and while considering what normal looks

232
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,080
like we had some cleanup to do as well

233
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,160
my apologies if that triggers anyone

234
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,400
those those are bad

235
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,319
so our new capability model centers on

236
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:57,680
the intersection

237
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,879
sorry i've gone too far on the

238
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,039
intersection of assets vulnerabilities

239
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,960
and threats pretty common language to

240
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,960
most of the people here but this is the

241
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,560
core of our approach

242
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,960
to understand our attack surface how we

243
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,120
will be attacked we need to know what we

244
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,800
have as assets and how they're

245
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,919
vulnerable

246
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,000
to understand the attacker's motivations

247
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
we need to know the value of those

248
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,120
assets and who may want to harm us

249
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,479
and to understand how we will be

250
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,400
attacked we need to know the threats

251
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,520
against us and our own vulnerabilities

252
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,599
where they all meet is our business risk

253
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,599
just like finance and hr

254
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,120
cyber is a risk to the business and

255
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,159
should be treated as such

256
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,399
moving to reskill

257
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,000
immediately after the breach we had to

258
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,880
tackle the unknown unknowns blind spots

259
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,480
and question marks

260
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,560
and the known unknowns answering the

261
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,640
question what is on our network and

262
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,240
should it be

263
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,839
the university was carrying a lot of

264
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,519
legacy infrastructure and a lot of

265
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,160
bespoke research and technical equipment

266
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,000
this meant a lot of tech debt leading to

267
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,839
a lot of security debt

268
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,200
we simply didn't know where we were

269
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,839
vulnerable and the state of our systems

270
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:06,000
further we had to untangle who owned

271
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,640
what and was responsible for maintenance

272
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,040
the anu is like its own city with all

273
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,480
the diversity and complexity that you

274
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,000
might expect

275
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,760
at any given time we have in the order

276
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,959
of 74 000 devices on our network

277
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,360
including workstations and servers

278
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,160
running windows linux apple hpe cisco

279
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:27,600
apc android unix among others

280
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,959
while some machines were centrally

281
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,399
managed by the university's i t

282
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,800
department some colleges run their own

283
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,640
some researchers would buy or build

284
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,640
their own kit and plug it in

285
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,920
and they're around twenty thousand

286
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,200
students with an average of three

287
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,000
devices each on the network

288
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,160
but the network is that one commonality

289
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,160
between all of these environments so the

290
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,480
majority of our early focus was in focus

291
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,519
there

292
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,120
we introduced technical safeguards

293
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,839
including firewall zoning mfa encryption

294
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:56,480
data de-risking and macro blocking

295
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,399
we partnered with industry to deploy a

296
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,160
network visibility tool across the

297
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,120
entire network we lit every door

298
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,360
dark corner and started ingesting

299
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,200
real-time data

300
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,760
we linked our npb to patch vulnerability

301
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,600
and privileged access tools

302
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,440
and where we had integrations and

303
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,680
improving automation to provide scale

304
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,160
and defense in depth

305
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,760
and when i say we lit all the dark

306
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,680
corners on the network this is what that

307
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,959
looked like

308
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,279
every dot represents a device but it

309
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,680
also represents a scientific or academic

310
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,040
aspiration

311
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,360
something we need to protect and in most

312
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,200
cases enable

313
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,120
in addition to the devices you'd expect

314
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:38,560
we have a lot of byod iot medical iot

315
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,560
operational tech and scientific

316
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,920
instrumentation

317
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,320
things that were purchased in 1970 and

318
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,560
cannot be upgraded

319
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,320
those clusters you see around the edges

320
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,720
are private networks within the anu

321
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,399
where someone clever decided to buy

322
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,720
something clever and plug it in

323
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,480
i'll talk about culture in a moment but

324
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,079
academics as a general rule have a

325
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,000
strong sense of personal ownership over

326
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,079
technology and data and we have to work

327
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,600
with that

328
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,920
the chaotic cluster at the bottom right

329
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,079
is the residential halls anu is also an

330
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:10,560
isp

331
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,320
we have to protect everything from a

332
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,000
student connecting to the network on the

333
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,160
cheapest gray market smartphone they can

334
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,399
find to a plasma fusion reactor with an

335
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,760
i p address

336
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,360
which is basically a sun

337
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,120
moving on

338
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,279
following the breach and the no holds

339
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,279
barred executive support for our remit

340
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,760
we rapidly introduced or upgraded a lot

341
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,279
of technology solutions in our

342
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:34,399
environment

343
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,399
some of this was just actioning upgrades

344
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,320
that had been on the back burner

345
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,800
others were whole scale reforms we

346
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,040
introduced new tools took ownership of

347
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,800
tools that needed to be fixed or worked

348
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
hand-in-hand with the area responsible

349
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,120
for a tool to uplift it

350
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,360
our approach to technology and tools is

351
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,959
modular

352
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,639
the backbone of our environment is the

353
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,399
network and the tools plug into this

354
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,440
spine

355
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,279
we are not beholden to one stack or

356
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,040
technology partner we look for

357
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,920
functionality integration automation and

358
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,600
importantly alignment with the

359
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,440
university's values

360
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,600
some of these tools already form the

361
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,800
core conceptual framing for xero trust

362
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,480
the same modularity can be said for the

363
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,480
frameworks we follow while we're guided

364
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,880
by ism and we're building our compliance

365
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,680
model against essential 8 and top 37

366
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,360
we also draw insights from nist and

367
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,279
other international standards

368
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,360
the university's environment is unique

369
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,360
and as such there's no one rule book to

370
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,760
follow

371
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,600
with the right funding and authority and

372
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,160
the right tools we were able to up

373
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,839
achieve a significant security uplift in

374
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,279
the first 12 months

375
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,720
we have continued to strengthen our

376
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,800
protection again and processes to keep

377
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,480
pace with the expanding threat against

378
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,360
us

379
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,279
in april this year we blocked over 14

380
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,200
million malicious attacks and intrusion

381
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,399
attempts we blocked 307 000 phishing

382
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,519
attempts

383
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,519
due to the tuning of our mail filtering

384
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,160
and education for our staff the success

385
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,320
rate of phishing campaigns that is

386
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,839
getting to the point where a user clicks

387
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:04,880
a link

388
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,320
is now down to 0.12 percent

389
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,079
we're also actively black blocking

390
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,560
around 20 000 malicious ip ranges and

391
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,680
domains per day

392
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,680
as we modernize our tools and clarified

393
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,200
our understanding of our environment we

394
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,160
needed to change the way we do business

395
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,000
we started using the data feeds from our

396
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,160
new tools to profile the network

397
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,680
specifically we looked at device

398
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,760
identification the characteristics of

399
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,720
those devices communication channels

400
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,399
protocol analysis

401
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,160
building a complete asset inventory

402
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,760
linked to criticality

403
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,279
and revisiting current policies and

404
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,120
procedures to see if they align to best

405
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,360
practice or even current practice

406
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,760
now that we knew what we had we shifted

407
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,079
to threats we focused on ingesting

408
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,079
intelligence and understanding tactics

409
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,839
techniques and procedures

410
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,680
improving our capability to detect

411
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,440
external and internal reconnaissance

412
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,560
activity

413
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,360
our openness to lateral movement

414
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,600
the motivation of threat actors and what

415
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,120
they might target

416
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,279
and an alert system for exfiltration

417
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,680
attempts

418
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,399
while analysis analyzing threats we also

419
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,440
undertook to better understand our

420
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,079
weaknesses and vulnerable abilities by

421
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,639
linking network data to device profiles

422
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,639
undertaking continual health checks and

423
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,360
monitoring introducing and auditing

424
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,240
technical controls like patching

425
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,240
improving hardening and auditing admin

426
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,959
controls improving perimeter controls

427
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,480
and putting everything through a risk

428
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,399
management framework

429
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,399
and that's the last simpsons gif

430
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,720
probably

431
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
everything that i've just outlined every

432
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,040
effort we undertake has a particular and

433
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,720
intentional focus

434
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,440
we view information security as a human

435
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,760
centric challenge one which frames our

436
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,360
behavior and decisions at the

437
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,959
intersection of people process and

438
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:55,360
technology within our environment

439
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,519
behind every data breach behind the

440
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,519
technical detail is a human-centric

441
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,519
story full of emotion

442
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,279
the biggest threat to security is at the

443
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,199
end of the keyboard but they are also

444
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,959
our greatest protection if they know how

445
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,199
to be vigilant and what is and isn't

446
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,760
right behavior

447
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,360
this leads us nicely into the final

448
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,399
section of reskill our people

449
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,560
for us this is the anu community

450
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,560
students professional staff academic

451
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,680
staff researchers partners and alumni

452
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,920
re-skilling the environment affecting

453
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,000
real change means changing the behavior

454
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,360
of our users

455
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,720
teaching them how to operate in a more

456
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,560
secure manner and how to be vigilant to

457
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,600
threats

458
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,440
this means changing both our approach

459
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,120
and their mindset

460
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,959
changing the mindset is multifaceted and

461
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:41,279
subtle hackers don't just hack systems

462
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,720
they hack people

463
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,240
the cyber threat actors hack your

464
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,920
culture all the time why can't the

465
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,079
defenders do it too

466
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,839
successful cyber programs have in their

467
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,880
dna a strong change management component

468
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,720
so we needed to borrow from behavioral

469
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,399
psychology and organizational change

470
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,240
management among others

471
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,759
in our case we were fortunate enough to

472
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,360
have the psychologists just across

473
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,560
campus

474
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,320
they helped us design a human-centric

475
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,880
program based on reinforcing personal

476
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,800
accountability using empathy and

477
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,880
understanding ensuring a positive

478
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,680
security experience and obvious value

479
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,519
communicating the benefits before the

480
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,920
risks and defending our values and our

481
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,440
purpose

482
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,279
this we needed to do at every level of

483
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,199
the organization and we're still hard at

484
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,279
it

485
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,440
our cultural change program is called

486
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,160
cybersense it aims to use the skills and

487
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,160
understanding that we give to these

488
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,920
participants to apply scrutiny and

489
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,920
common sense to the environment we give

490
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,480
them the confidence to scrutinize

491
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,560
this program which kicked off in 2021

492
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,959
comprises online and bespoke training

493
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,240
videos road shows resource libraries and

494
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,959
tools that researchers and staff can use

495
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,120
to help make them be safer

496
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,320
with upwards of 2500 users that is 2500

497
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,480
opportunities for error but it's also

498
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,680
2500 opportunities for cyber champions

499
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,279
already we're seeing a significant

500
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,440
increase in disclosures from staff who

501
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,119
think they have clicked a dodgy link who

502
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,799
noticed suspicious activity in their

503
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,119
email account or just want us to check

504
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,199
something that feels wrong

505
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,439
even our own legitimate emails usually

506
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:14,400
mine

507
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,480
get reported and pinged for being overly

508
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,000
opaque or for encouraging urgent action

509
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,839
so we're learning from that too we need

510
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,119
to change our language and we need to

511
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,839
understand our audience

512
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,960
for cyber sense as you can see we've

513
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,360
leaned hard into the quirky side of the

514
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,919
university we use humor to affect change

515
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,919
to make messages that cut through and

516
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,360
are memorable

517
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,039
you might recognize some of the faces up

518
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,640
on the slide right now there are

519
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,640
chancellor julie bishop former foreign

520
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,679
minister

521
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,840
vice chancellor brian schmidt

522
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,320
nobel prize winner and comedian chris

523
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,200
ryan

524
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,200
the former let us animate them because

525
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,640
of how much they believe in our body of

526
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,440
work

527
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,880
the latter did because we paid her and

528
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,440
it was funny

529
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,039
so we did a rethink of who what and why

530
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,960
we are we started a body of work to

531
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,520
reskill our technology our processes and

532
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:06,799
our people

533
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,320
the next phase of our journey is the

534
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,640
reboot retiring the old and starting

535
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,400
anew on a platform that will be able to

536
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,400
support and secure the university's

537
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,960
growth a zero trust environment based on

538
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,000
infrastructure as code

539
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,600
it's important to understand what zero

540
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,760
trust is and is not

541
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,160
zero trust is an architectural principle

542
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,760
based on the removal of implicit

543
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,080
automatic trust and the introduction of

544
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,400
explicit constantly verified trust or

545
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,840
adaptive trust

546
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,360
this principle can form the basis of

547
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,200
identity and authorization on more than

548
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,120
just networks and it can should be

549
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,280
linked to business intent

550
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,200
we're applying zero trust as a lens

551
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,480
through which we build our modern

552
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,919
infrastructure

553
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,919
but zero trust is not an off-the-shelf

554
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,480
product one technology tool that you can

555
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,799
plug in or firewall rule that you can

556
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,919
set

557
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,919
the paradigm of zero trust as a

558
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,240
foundational principle of infrastructure

559
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,559
replaces what we currently have

560
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,559
insecure disparate and high maintenance

561
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,160
processes

562
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,160
with a modern system that is secured by

563
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,919
design the new network will bring

564
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,080
together multiple activities systems and

565
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,160
functions into one

566
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,440
system with less tooling and

567
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,840
inconsistency

568
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,840
zero trust for amu means infrastructure

569
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:21,360
that is resilient adaptive and enabling

570
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,039
zero trust takes a more granular

571
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,039
approach than traditional castle and

572
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,960
moat network security

573
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,440
every application every person every

574
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,440
device must prove its identity and

575
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,000
authority before every session and once

576
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,160
authentication has occurred they only

577
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,600
get least privileged once they're in

578
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,880
there

579
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,760
xerotrust is also software defined so ie

580
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,520
infrastructure is code

581
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,280
software defined means utilizing

582
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,080
programming for interfaces source code

583
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,160
to manage configure and reconfigure the

584
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,400
network this means the network is highly

585
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,960
customizable very quickly and distinct

586
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,280
from traditional networks which rely on

587
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,160
hardware reconfiguration to make changes

588
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,360
sometimes this is also called

589
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,440
programmable infrastructure it also

590
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,120
allows for the creation of repeated

591
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,039
patterns and automation which makes

592
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,200
configuration and reconfiguration even

593
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,440
easier still

594
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,440
implementing xero trust involves

595
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,039
building the right systems from the

596
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,200
ground up which means it needs funding

597
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,960
support and engagement

598
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,440
so what why have you all come to listen

599
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,120
to me speak today

600
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,520
does the anu's journey from breached to

601
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,679
more secure create a roadmap for others

602
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:30,799
to follow

603
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,400
i think it does

604
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,480
our hard learned lessons can act as a

605
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,440
guide like the man said our pain can be

606
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,960
your game

607
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,720
keep in mind that your unique strengths

608
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,799
and problems will form a unique solution

609
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,880
so a couple of bits of advice

610
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,200
first have compassion for your starting

611
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,600
point it's the place to build from it's

612
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,440
the place to learn from

613
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,200
if you don't know what you have you

614
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,559
don't know what you can leverage and

615
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,559
what you have to protect

616
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,520
map your environment map with realistic

617
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,480
capability map your behavior

618
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,320
know your assets your vulnerabilities

619
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,760
and your threats

620
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,640
and apply empathy when looking inward

621
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:14,640
it's not us versus them it's just us

622
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,679
understand the norms of your

623
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,760
organization and their relationship with

624
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,840
the technology

625
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,280
understand the behavior that needs to

626
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,440
change at every level

627
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,520
build a plan around that behavioral

628
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,679
change a plan that's well defined and is

629
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:28,840
easy to

630
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,960
support a plan that removes fake

631
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,280
friction and adds value

632
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,840
set realistic but slightly ambitious

633
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,280
goals

634
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,200
work the problem in a logical order

635
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,440
linked to risk

636
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,320
build borrow and buy the skills and

637
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,039
tools required if you buy and borrow

638
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,880
make a plan to build so you have

639
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,960
internal capability

640
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,559
choose partners that align to your

641
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,480
values and will be there alongside you

642
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,600
when things go right and wrong

643
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,280
because they will

644
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,960
if you underpin infrastructure change

645
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,360
with behavioral change you'll achieve a

646
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,840
more sustainable outcome

647
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,919
build for your future needs

648
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:10,720
build a solution not a fix

649
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,760
and finally add value and earn the right

650
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,000
to optimize

651
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,220
thank you

652
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:20,380
[Applause]

653
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,880
thank you very much please please enjoy

654
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,720
the gift as well the taka gin made by

655
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,960
some indigenous female distillers here

656
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:30,720
in australia wonderful stuff i do know

657
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,559
also the chancellor i'm sorry the vice

658
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:35,280
chancellor at anu brian schmidt of

659
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,640
course who won the nobel prize for

660
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,640
physics a few years back for his team

661
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,919
showing the universe was continuing to

662
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,840
expand and explain increasing rate was

663
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,440
going to collapse on itself while it's

664
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,120
not his specialty area he would just

665
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,640
totally geek down on this sort of stuff

666
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,480
wouldn't he he would have absolutely

667
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,440
loved to give liz another round of

668
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,640
applause thank you what a great great

669
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,960
presentation very honest very open not

670
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,799
unlike brett's one this morning our next

671
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,240
speaker is a specialist in threat

672
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,240
intelligence and threat hunting he works

673
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,360
in the virus total team in google as a

674
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,159
threat intelligence strategist he's been

675
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,159
a crime manager in s21 sec for five

676
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,159
years he was deputy director for eu and

677
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,320
kaspersky's global research analysis

678
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,400
team for almost 10 years he's here to

679
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,480
take us on an adventure from threat

680
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,919
hunting to actionable threat intel from

681
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,780
virustotal this is vicente diaz

682
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:29,080
[Applause]

683
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,639
oops

684
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,600
so i was attending i was paying

685
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,880
attention

686
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,480
to the previous talk

687
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,320
and i realized i was very hungry and i

688
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,640
was like why is that it's because for me

689
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,279
it's breakfast i'm from barcelona spain

690
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:48,480
so

691
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,440
apologies if if i look like a little bit

692
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,080
confused at some point but yet lucky as

693
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,039
well

694
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,799
so i've been

695
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:59,120
home for the last two years because of

696
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,279
kovit like everybody else

697
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:03,360
and so this is my first business trip

698
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,720
since then

699
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,799
and i chose like

700
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,960
the opposite side of the world basically

701
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,159
to travel

702
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,480
and i don't know if that was the best

703
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,880
idea but i'm really thankful for

704
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,880
inviting me for this conference and i'm

705
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,640
really enjoying so far

706
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,279
um okay so let's go back to our

707
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:24,080
presentation today my name is kitten tv

708
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,000
and thank you very much once again for

709
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,240
inviting me for this conference and

710
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,320
for the last 10 years before joining by

711
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,760
aristotle

712
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,760
i was in kaspersky and we were

713
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,960
investigating apt attacks basically

714
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,840
so

715
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:40,159
from my experience there i wanted today

716
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,240
to share some of the ideas lessons

717
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,720
learned and how how i think that things

718
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,400
have changed

719
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,000
during all this time

720
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,360
because these days we're all talking

721
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,760
about threat intel but it's not so clear

722
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,840
how to use it and

723
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,919
now in barista i have the opportunity to

724
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,919
see how many of our customers are

725
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,559
dealing with all these threat intel

726
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:01,520
and

727
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,440
sometimes well

728
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,880
i would like to share a little bit where

729
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,080
is my vision maybe you appear or not but

730
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,360
i think it's interesting to discuss

731
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,400
so

732
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,159
the first question when i was preparing

733
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,240
this presentation is why we do threat

734
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,880
hunting what is the reason behind and

735
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,200
basically the answer is to get some

736
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,600
context we want to know hey i have these

737
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,240
indicators of compromise i saw this

738
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,880
happening in my company in my computer

739
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,559
and i want to get more context i want to

740
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:32,720
know a little bit more this is basically

741
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,360
the main reason we are doing this handy

742
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,760
but also we want sometimes to detect

743
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,200
something new we do this paleontology we

744
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,360
discovered these big campaigns in the

745
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,720
past and we are creating like a better

746
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,520
understanding of how attackers are using

747
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,600
different tools and techniques in order

748
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,080
to infect us right

749
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,200
um

750
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,039
and this changed a lot in the la during

751
00:25:57,039 --> 00:26:00,000
the last years basically i would say the

752
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,159
difference the main difference is that

753
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,039
now

754
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,080
we have much more data to share

755
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,159
and this is not necessarily something

756
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:12,559
good because by having that much data um

757
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,200
it's computationally difficult sometimes

758
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,799
to understand things

759
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,000
and also we've been basically building

760
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,840
as we were encountering things as we

761
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,080
were understanding how to deal with all

762
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,880
that

763
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,480
and at some point

764
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,720
this created a lot of noise

765
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,919
that keeps stacking is making this a

766
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,559
snowball effect and at the end

767
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,320
something small like somebody

768
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
intelligence from the very beginning

769
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,760
keeps growing and today we are making

770
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,400
maybe some bad attribution based on some

771
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,159
report that was published eight years

772
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,240
ago uh where there was some

773
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,320
misunderstanding about this group this

774
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,799
sector et cetera et cetera so this is a

775
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:55,520
danger that we are having so much intel

776
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,960
so much data

777
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,720
and the data that we are having for

778
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,520
threat intel it was not

779
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,919
well it was not designed to be sure in

780
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,880
the the best efficient way for instance

781
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,480
if i share with you

782
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,320
uh this ip

783
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,960
this is some random publication i i got

784
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,480
it from otx

785
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,080
alimbold

786
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,760
and i was taking a look this is from a

787
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,000
publication from asset and they are

788
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,480
talking a thing is about set net

789
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,440
so

790
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,760
this ap if i share with you today and i

791
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,240
say hey this ip is malicious

792
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,039
you will be asking yourselves okay why

793
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:32,480
well in this case it's a domain sorry

794
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,320
but you will be asking yourselves why is

795
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,440
malicious

796
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,120
what is behind

797
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,399
and since when this is malicious

798
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,000
in reality

799
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,840
i was checking the report

800
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,360
and what they said is that this was

801
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,320
compromised and was serving some malware

802
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,399
so my question here for you is should we

803
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,080
block it

804
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,159
or not

805
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,399
well it's it depends right depends what

806
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,480
is your purpose with this but what i'm

807
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,679
saying is that

808
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,679
basically what we do is we get any

809
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,640
publication we get all the iocs we put

810
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:07,760
the text yes set need malicious

811
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,520
and we throw it into some thread into

812
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,720
the system

813
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,880
and from here if we don't read the

814
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,640
original report

815
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,480
then we don't know why

816
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,720
when how et cetera et cetera we will

817
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,679
simply say hey this is segment activity

818
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,039
maybe it's not

819
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,600
so it's just a silly example what is

820
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,000
reflecting what i want to say here that

821
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,799
this noise keeps growing

822
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,000
to make things a little bit more

823
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,320
complicated in the past we had like all

824
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,240
these attacks uh

825
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,000
different groups creating their own

826
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,840
malware we have like different

827
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,360
signatures we have

828
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,840
uh like good understanding what kind of

829
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,760
tool sets different actors were using

830
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,679
this is not the case anymore

831
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,760
where most of the attackers are using

832
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,559
more or less the same stuff if i say

833
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:53,520
i don't know

834
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,360
cobalt strike

835
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,880
mimikats

836
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,640
all this kind of stuff is what attackers

837
00:28:58,640 --> 00:28:59,679
are using

838
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,120
over and over

839
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,520
in many cases like we saw this morning

840
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,279
uh lapsus group

841
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,960
what are they using basically they're

842
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,760
stealing credentials and from here they

843
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,520
are able to get whatever they want so

844
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,440
it's not about sometimes the complexity

845
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,720
of the malware

846
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,520
and there is not such a thing like a

847
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,120
signature for the groups we started

848
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,720
creating ttps

849
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,840
which is

850
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,600
it sounds good on paper but later it's

851
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,399
very difficult to characterize a group

852
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:31,360
by ttps without any technical further

853
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,559
details

854
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,240
because eventually all the groups are

855
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,679
like fulfilling

856
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,520
all the boxes in the

857
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,799
enterprise attack metrics

858
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,640
but still i think that

859
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,880
if we are conscious of all these

860
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,279
difficulties there is a value in threat

861
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,320
hunting

862
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,320
and in my opinion

863
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:54,080
i would say there are like three main

864
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,919
things we can do when we do threat

865
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,120
hunting or

866
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,039
three main benefits of doing threat

867
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,720
hunting the first one

868
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,600
is having the knowledge

869
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,480
uh

870
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,240
to shape our security strategy so

871
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,840
sometimes we don't know how to start

872
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,559
sometimes we are making decisions based

873
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:14,640
on we don't know what

874
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,200
but this data exists today and with this

875
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,919
data we can shape what and we can

876
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,320
prioritize how should build our security

877
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,159
strategy let's say one simple example

878
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,679
ideally we want to have all the

879
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,080
vulnerabilities patch in our environment

880
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,919
but we don't know where to start we

881
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,840
don't know which ones are more critical

882
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,039
yes there are like cvss score so from

883
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,559
here we can say this is more critical

884
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,520
than that

885
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,919
but which one is being used today right

886
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:43,760
now by attackers

887
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,480
the most do you have an answer for this

888
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,399
the thing is that you can get an answer

889
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,720
for this and from here you can decide

890
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,520
like

891
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,360
i'm worried or not i should prioritize

892
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,159
this or another one

893
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:57,039
um

894
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,200
maybe in these campaigns for a more

895
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,440
comprehensive vision of the attacks this

896
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,600
is like the second goal and i think this

897
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,440
is extremely important because many

898
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,039
times

899
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,679
our conception of

900
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,000
our idea of the attacks

901
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,279
when they come from osint is like

902
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,679
publication iocs

903
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,840
end of the story may we have sanjar

904
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,440
rules that's it but it takes some effort

905
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,760
to actually follow the campaign and to

906
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,840
understand how it evolves

907
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,399
is some effort not much

908
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:33,279
but many people or many companies

909
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,039
in my experience they don't do this

910
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,240
extra step and the value is here

911
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,799
because the publication is at some point

912
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:41,840
in time

913
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,760
but the campaign goes on

914
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,840
so you need to see how it evolves and

915
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,240
you need to readjust a little bit just

916
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,919
to make sure that you are having a good

917
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:52,320
understanding how it's evolving

918
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,760
and finally for discovering new

919
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,399
malicious activity in this case

920
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,640
depends if you want i don't know to

921
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,080
discover something to make a

922
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,799
presentation here for instance or you

923
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,640
want to well

924
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,559
to check for anomalies that could be

925
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,880
related to your main activity to your

926
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,679
main infrastructure technologies etc etc

927
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,679
so i have some examples for all of these

928
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,679
the first thing is as we discussed about

929
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,080
this campaign tracking and monitoring

930
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,960
one of the things that i see many times

931
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,000
is that

932
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,919
yara rules for instance are not updated

933
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,159
they are taking like they are in some

934
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,200
cases

935
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,200
many of these are rules these days are

936
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,600
created automatically which is a good

937
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,840
thing is saving us a lot of time

938
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:40,799
but when these rules are created

939
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:43,519
many times they are overfitting

940
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,440
the samples that are used for the

941
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,559
research

942
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,720
meaning that they are detecting very

943
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,640
well these samples but maybe they don't

944
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,399
escalate so well

945
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,720
so sometimes we need to keep

946
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,120
working on them as they move on

947
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,039
sometimes we also see that the yard

948
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,919
rules are created from different malware

949
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,240
families which results in

950
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,279
uh

951
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,320
the rules are not so good and well what

952
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,880
i want to say is that just making this

953
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,360
effort to make sure that we are on top

954
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,679
of the campaigns and monitoring how they

955
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,840
evolve is bringing us a much complete

956
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,960
vision of how attackers are

957
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,559
creating their campaigns and what kind

958
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,519
of malware they're using

959
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,279
uh the second thing is the discovery new

960
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,120
activity actually yesterday we were

961
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,679
doing uh some worship here

962
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:32,720
um

963
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,559
and in the in the meantime we were doing

964
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,720
some exercises i just started taking a

965
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,519
look into this so i would like to share

966
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,440
with you if you don't mind

967
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,399
and

968
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:46,240
why i'm sharing this is just an example

969
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,000
um looks like the connection is not

970
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
great but happily i have it here open

971
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,880
already so this is just an example of

972
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,640
the

973
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,240
of the kind of things that we can do

974
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:58,640
these days

975
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,919
and

976
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,840
and this is saving a lot of time and

977
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,919
this is giving us a very good idea of

978
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,440
what's happening so i found this

979
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,799
document

980
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,719
this is a document that

981
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,719
for real i found yesterday i never seen

982
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:11,760
before

983
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,159
and this document

984
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,719
was related to

985
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,119
to some activity pretending to be

986
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:22,000
related to the war in the ukraine

987
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,480
here is called u.s analyze provide

988
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,599
chemical weapons to ukraine's military

989
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,480
and actually i found that from the same

990
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,520
domain

991
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,800
here

992
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,800
we found all these different documents

993
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,079
all of them

994
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:39,199
were served um

995
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,800
that all of them were submitted to

996
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,839
aristotle by one submitter

997
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,320
different submitters but only one which

998
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:49,119
means it's pretty targeted all of them

999
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,839
came from different countries

1000
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,480
if you see the countries hungary italy

1001
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,800
ireland great britain

1002
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,359
czech republic

1003
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,359
denmark lithuania

1004
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:02,960
and iceland

1005
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,880
and all of them

1006
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,880
were related to the same topic the

1007
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,960
chemical the kremlin's allegation of

1008
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,599
chemical and biological weapons

1009
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,560
putin face claims or whatever

1010
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,599
so all of them also were first in two

1011
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,640
days ago in barista for the first time

1012
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,640
so i started taking a look and from here

1013
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,240
i discovered well

1014
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,599
that this is related to some emoted and

1015
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:28,480
again

1016
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,560
this took like a few minutes just for me

1017
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,960
to understand at least the context

1018
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,880
and these days we can do things like

1019
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,760
that

1020
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,000
we can go into any of these documents

1021
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,200
and we can search for similarities

1022
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,919
like similar files

1023
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,240
and

1024
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,560
immediately we will get some results as

1025
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,720
you can see here so all these files are

1026
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,480
similar to this one

1027
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,040
and if we take a look to these ones

1028
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,200
nato's general who were hiding in the

1029
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,240
underground bunker whatever

1030
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,040
saying

1031
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,000
name list of nato generals so they are

1032
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,160
all slightly different chemical weapons

1033
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,000
but they are all part of the same

1034
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,480
cluster so this kind of technologies is

1035
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,400
something that 10 years ago when we were

1036
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,359
doing this apt research we didn't have

1037
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,960
and today we do

1038
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,920
and this is thanks first for having a

1039
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,480
big database that we've been growing all

1040
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,720
the community together

1041
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,320
and second by incorporating new

1042
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,800
techniques that allow us to do this

1043
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,359
in a very agile way so thanks to these

1044
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:32,400
things

1045
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,760
these days

1046
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,440
you can use thread hunting for

1047
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,960
discovering new activity and get the

1048
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,599
context pretty immediately which is

1049
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,119
great in case we find something

1050
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:43,760
suspicious

1051
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,079
finally we were talking about monitoring

1052
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,240
trends for this knowledge-based security

1053
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,640
strategy and here i wanted to share some

1054
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:52,560
of the discoveries we did during last

1055
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,400
year when we were monitoring

1056
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,520
changes

1057
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,000
in malware trends between 2020 and 2021

1058
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,119
uh just based on very subtle data

1059
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,280
so with those in these two years of

1060
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:06,640
malware

1061
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,480
we got some interesting ideas

1062
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,920
the first one

1063
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,640
was regarding the use of exploits

1064
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,000
so we found not only that there was a 37

1065
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,680
percent increase in the number of

1066
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,280
samples that were implementing some

1067
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,200
exploitation

1068
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,760
they were using things like a power

1069
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,240
shell for instance much more than before

1070
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,000
exploiting at least nine different

1071
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,320
vulnerabilities with power shell

1072
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,960
but the average of the most popular

1073
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,599
exploits being deployed in the wild

1074
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:37,119
dropped

1075
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,400
crazily

1076
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,760
in reality from 93 days to zero days it

1077
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,920
doesn't mean that every single

1078
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,480
vulnerability was the same day that it

1079
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:49,200
was published already in barista it

1080
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,880
doesn't mean that but this is the

1081
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,800
average meaning that some of them were

1082
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,880
significantly before at least for the

1083
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,359
most popular ones

1084
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,960
and we also found

1085
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,359
57 zero days

1086
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,599
vulnerabilities that were deployed in

1087
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,480
the wild so it means that

1088
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,359
attackers they have resources in this

1089
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,520
case for zero days and

1090
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,079
well i wouldn't say this is something

1091
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:16,720
that revolutionary to find anymore they

1092
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,200
simply have access to them

1093
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,520
the second thing is how they were

1094
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,359
moving to new formats this is also

1095
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:24,800
interesting

1096
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,400
like moving from docx files infected to

1097
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,079
excel files

1098
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,560
infected in the in reality it's the same

1099
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,800
there are simply macros behind

1100
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,240
but in

1101
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,400
our perception is that maybe this has to

1102
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,200
do with social engineering like you know

1103
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,040
that documents are malicious but maybe

1104
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,359
you are not sure about excel files and

1105
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,920
you are opening them we saw some big

1106
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,760
campaigns for instance deploying dry

1107
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,800
decks

1108
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,720
using this

1109
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,480
there was a huge increase in the number

1110
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:57,599
of l files that we saw in various hotel

1111
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,720
and the reason for this was also

1112
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,160
log4j

1113
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,839
obviously which was implementing this

1114
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:08,720
for some mirai tsunami

1115
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,280
and some coin miners this vulnerability

1116
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,520
in order to spread the malware as fast

1117
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,160
as possible so this was one of these

1118
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,520
events that

1119
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:19,920
somehow it could it has the potential to

1120
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,119
change everything this kind of

1121
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,680
vulnerabilities

1122
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,040
we also saw

1123
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:27,839
how they are switching their tool set

1124
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,560
from some rats from some different

1125
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:33,359
backdoors to new ones or even to all

1126
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,880
ones that they were

1127
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,000
reshaped

1128
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,480
for instance things like drydex we saw

1129
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,359
an increase of almost 1 000 well not

1130
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:42,640
almost one thousand three hundred

1131
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:43,760
percent

1132
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,160
uh a cigarette also

1133
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,000
an increase of one hundred and thirty

1134
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,359
percent

1135
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,920
while other rats basically disappear

1136
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,400
from byrosotta like this gravity rat or

1137
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,800
dorkbot here you can see for instance

1138
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,119
in this chart the number of loot caps

1139
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:00,720
for cobalt strike

1140
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,440
and well what is funny is that if you

1141
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,200
see the other part of the chart which as

1142
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,040
you have included here

1143
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,359
you see first the submissions and then

1144
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:11,440
you see the lookups so basically first

1145
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,040
they are submitted to various total they

1146
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,760
are being exploited later and people is

1147
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:18,160
searching for them like what is that

1148
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,160
but basically you can keep an eye

1149
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,560
first in what kind of malware attackers

1150
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,560
are using and make sure that you are

1151
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,440
good protected against that and second

1152
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,839
in many cases we don't pay attention to

1153
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,400
all these generic backdoors and rats

1154
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,319
just because they are all and we are

1155
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:35,440
like

1156
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,040
who cares about this rat if it is

1157
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,400
detected or not

1158
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:41,359
but this is the first step in the kill

1159
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:42,800
chain of the attackers to deploy

1160
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,359
whatever it is in this case drydex i was

1161
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,920
super surprised but still

1162
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,400
we also saw sea loader

1163
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,480
being used by attackers to deploy

1164
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,200
a lot of ransomware so it's interesting

1165
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,760
because still this malware has uh an

1166
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,079
important role by attackers

1167
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,880
so just to finish my presentation

1168
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,079
um

1169
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:06,880
just to to double down on these ideas i

1170
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:09,520
think that this constant evolution for

1171
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,880
threat hunting

1172
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,319
is something that

1173
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:15,040
if we are conscious of the limitations

1174
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,520
is a good thing uh because we can use it

1175
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,599
in a much more efficient way but we need

1176
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,440
to define the goals that we want to

1177
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,560
accomplish

1178
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,000
i think

1179
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,280
that just simply accumulating iocs and

1180
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,079
accumulating data without any purpose at

1181
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:32,000
the end of the day is a problem

1182
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,000
we need to put a little bit of effort

1183
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,920
just to do this monitoring as i said and

1184
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,920
to make sure that all the data that we

1185
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,200
are ingesting

1186
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:43,920
is is valid is solid um because this at

1187
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,160
the end of the day we don't do that

1188
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,760
this snowball effect is created and then

1189
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,280
we can make big errors uh when assessing

1190
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,880
our intelligence

1191
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,200
but still i think that the potential is

1192
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,599
is tremendous i think that this is

1193
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:00,880
something

1194
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:01,760
that

1195
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,079
we are all exploring together we are all

1196
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:06,880
growing this is a new set of techniques

1197
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:09,760
that is changing uh with time as well as

1198
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,520
the tools that we are using

1199
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:12,720
so

1200
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,520
still i think is a vital element for any

1201
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,800
security strategy and thanks

1202
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,040
to the new technologies we can start

1203
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:22,800
using this but

1204
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:24,640
again the most important thing is to

1205
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,119
define the goals how we want to use it

1206
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:29,520
so we can make something out of this

1207
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,839
so that will be everything thank you

1208
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:33,680
very much and i will be around if you

1209
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:36,079
have any questions just let me know

1210
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,319
thank you

1211
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,160
am i the only person who's going to miss

1212
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,680
dork bot

1213
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,800
probably that's the way it goes thank

1214
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,839
you very much for sending you can watch

1215

00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:03,200
wrestling with his jet laggers he

1217
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,640
alternates between complete fatigue and

1218
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,760
a thousand percent energy give him

1219
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,720
another round of applause that was a

1220
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,400
wonderful chat mate real interesting

1221
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,680
stuff

1222

topic of sponsors going to thank again

1225
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:15,440

brett this morning emt gigamon and

1227
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,520
netscope did someone say netscope that

1228
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,200
brings us to our final speaker for day

addition to working across the industry

1235
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:36,319
with the owner making the digital

1236

economy a safer place to do business to

1237
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,480
talk about the integrated security model

1238
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,800
security beyond just cyber brier

1239
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:48,240
applause policemen david fairman

1240
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,280
hello um welcome everyone i realize that

1241
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,200
i think i'm the last session and you

1242
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,200
hear this every sec every conference the

1243
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,560
last session we

1244
00:43:58,560 --> 00:43:59,839
everybody's waiting for their drinks

1245
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,440
i'll try and keep this quick

1246
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,200
um but hopefully you'll learn a little

1247
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,520
bit of something from my presentation so

1248
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:06,960
look i'm just talking about my

1249
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,800
experience

1250
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,000
for those of you who don't know me i've

1251
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,880
had a long career in banking finance

1252
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,200
at the cso cso level

1253
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,800
i've built two fusion centers one for

1254
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,160
for nab

1255
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,680
when i repatriated back to australia in

1256
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,119
2018

1257
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,200
and i built one for rbc as well and and

1258
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,720
i'm going to talk about the fusion

1259
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:26,400
center and the integrated security model

1260
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,599
and i i guess

1261
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:28,800
maybe i think about it a little bit

1262
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,599
differently to how other people sort of

1263
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,920
view fusion centers uh

1264
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:37,119
and i'll i'll explore that i'll explore

1265
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:39,200
you know a couple of the techniques you

1266
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,680
can use to think about

1267
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,599
venturing into this space and more of

1268
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:47,280
the point the outcomes we can achieve

1269
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,599
so

1270
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,119
what we'll discuss

1271
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:54,480
i sort of covered that already so

1272
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,839
complex environment we know that

1273
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:00,079
you know the

1274
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:01,440
i don't have to explain the threat

1275
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:03,680
landscape and and the the rise in

1276
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,359
sophistication and velocity and

1277
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:07,599
sophistication of attacks here

1278
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:10,160
but i think what's really interesting is

1279
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,000
the

1280
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,800
what we've seen as an evolution

1281
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:16,880
over i would say

1282
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,480
i'm actually going to say sort of 12

1283
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:19,680
years

1284
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,640
is

1285
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:23,119
the expanding role of the cso or the

1286
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,280
security officer

1287
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,240
and i'll give you a little bit of a

1288
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,040
history of my history my experience

1289
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,800
so i think if we go back and we talk

1290
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,720
about fusion centers where did the term

1291
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,960
fusion center come from after 9 11 it

1292
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,119
was really about how the intelligence

1293
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,599
agencies came together to really share

1294
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:41,119
intelligence in a lot better way because

1295
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:43,280
we knew we found out

1296
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,200
that they weren't communicating they

1297
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,319
weren't sharing they didn't have the

1298
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:47,680
situational awareness and there were

1299
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,880
silos

1300
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:52,240
and that actually led to exposures or or

1301
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:53,680
lack of understanding of what was

1302
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,000
happening in the threat environment

1303
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,359
so that sort of started to drive through

1304
00:45:57,359 --> 00:45:58,400
government

1305
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,760
and you found that

1306
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,599
industry started to take on that process

1307
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:03,680
as well or take on that concept and it

1308
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,119
became very

1309
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:06,160
um

1310
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,520
i think the leaders in this space

1311
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:09,839
personally was the european banks i'll

1312
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,520
give you an example

1313
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,040
i started at royal bank of scotland in

1314
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,640
2005

1315
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,720
i worked in a division called security

1316
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:19,440
and fraud so we had an integrating in

1317
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:21,040
what i call the enterprise or the

1318
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,240
integrated security model back in 2005.

1319
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,839
you know i was part of the information

1320
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:27,520
security function we reported into a

1321
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,040
director of security and fraud

1322
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,119
and that director of security and fraud

1323
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,200
covered multiple functions information

1324
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,440
security business continuity crisis

1325
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:38,720
management

1326
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,920
intelligence

1327
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,359
physical security

1328
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:45,440
fraud investigations

1329
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,000
uh financial crime it was

1330
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:48,880
and

1331
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,480
if you look at rbs if you look at

1332
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,800
barclays if you look at lloyds they were

1333
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,640
operating in that space and they were

1334
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,640
really starting to break down silos

1335
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,400
between all these

1336
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,880
uh you know front to back security

1337
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:02,800
functions of the bank and we started to

1338
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,160
realize that there was a lot better

1339
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,720
situational awareness and

1340
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,480
insights that we could

1341
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:10,319
you know collaborate on and actually

1342
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,400
make faster decisions around what was

1343
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,280
happening

1344
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,000
uh in terms of financial crime fraud and

1345
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,640
even cyber threat back in the day

1346
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:21,200
and i think if you you know if you

1347
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,800
you think about that evolution that's

1348
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,319
back in 2005 2007 through to 2010 the

1349
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:28,000
u.s banks i think started to pick that

1350
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,119
up obviously when i came to nab in 2018

1351
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,800
nab was the first bank in australia and

1352
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,880
a couple of these the uh you know other

1353
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:36,319
australian organizations i want to call

1354
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,079
that iag and nbn you know they had

1355
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:39,520
brought fraud and cyber security

1356
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:40,800
together that's great that's sort of one

1357
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,440
part of it you look at iag today they've

1358
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,720
really started to move through that

1359
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,119
process where they're bringing fraud

1360
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:49,680
investigation cyber physical together

1361
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,119
but nab was the first bank to do that

1362
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,440
here cba have just done that underneath

1363
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,640
brendan good who's the new chief

1364
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:58,079
security officer there at cba

1365
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,720
but i think you know that those cso or

1366
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,319
cso roles

1367
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,720
are now expected we're expected now

1368
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,480
these days to have a much broader

1369
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:07,599
understanding of what's happening in the

1370
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:08,800
business

1371
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,400
understanding

1372
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:12,240
what impacts are happening to our

1373
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,240
customers

1374
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,040
and

1375
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,720
you know making much smarter faster

1376
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,640
defense decisions

1377
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:21,839
and i'm going to talk about that in a

1378
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:22,960
little uh

1379
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,480
in a second

1380
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:26,000
so the journey to fusion i sort of

1381
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,440
spoken about that evolution from an

1382
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:29,839
operating model perspective

1383
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,520
which is really breaking down the silos

1384
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:34,559
of those functions

1385
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,720
figuring out that end-to-end operating

1386
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:38,319
when i talk about that end-to-end

1387
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:40,000
operating model what are the handoffs

1388
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,760
between these different functions and

1389
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:43,520
it's not just i'm not just talking about

1390
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:45,040
cyber fusion here i think we all talk

1391
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,880
about cyber fusion we talk about

1392
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,040
you know breaking down the silos between

1393
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,520
our i don't know our pen testing teams

1394
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:54,480
and our sock teams and our grc teams

1395
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,920
that's sort of just running a cyber

1396
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,760
function in my opinion

1397
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,920
you know you need to make sure your your

1398
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,079
core team is is communicating and you've

1399
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:03,920
got clear handoffs but let's make this

1400
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,319
bigger this must be much bigger than

1401
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:08,720
just a cyber conversation it needs to be

1402
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,440
an operational resilience conversation

1403
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,359
and that's where you start to bring in

1404
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:14,640
these other functions the fraud

1405
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,160
functions the investigations functions

1406
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:18,160
physical security business continuity et

1407
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,680
cetera

1408
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:21,680
and there's different sort of processes

1409
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:24,160
you can you can take and you know

1410
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:25,760
journeys in terms of for different

1411
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,520
organizations but

1412
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:30,079
you know what we start to see there is

1413
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:31,920
really we start to see

1414
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,400
a data driven approach

1415
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,720
to how we start to solve and digitally

1416
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,119
transform our own security function

1417
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:42,160
and that's where i think fusion

1418
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:44,720
has been really successful for

1419
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,319
security functions we talk about digital

1420
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,240
transformation

1421
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:50,400
in our own business right we know that

1422
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:52,800
our organizations are steaming down this

1423
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:53,920
digital transformer all this

1424
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,160
digitization or this digital strategy

1425
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,280
they're doing that for a couple of

1426
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,720
reasons one they don't want to take cost

1427
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:00,160
out of the environment

1428
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,359
and they want to create you know

1429
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:03,520
productivity benefit but two they want

1430
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,319
to

1431
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:05,839
reap value

1432
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:07,440
from that data they want to get greater

1433
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,280
insights from that data they want to be

1434
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,480
able to

1435
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,480
understand their customer better they

1436
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,079
want to be able to

1437
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,640
understand what what products and

1438
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,400
markets they want to enter into they

1439
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:20,880
want to make smarter business decisions

1440
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,880
the organization the business itself is

1441
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,440
becoming this data driven organization

1442
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:27,760
the fusion center in my view

1443
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:30,000
is the security team's own digital

1444
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,200
transformation or digital strategy

1445
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,800
because we want to get greater insights

1446
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,960
from that data we want to change and

1447
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,800
transform the way that we've operated in

1448
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:41,760
the past we want to take cost out

1449
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,359
we want to simplify

1450
00:50:43,359 --> 00:50:47,279
but we want to reap value from that data

1451
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,920
from my perspective

1452
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:51,839
how do you start thinking about a

1453
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:53,280
fusion center how do you define it how

1454
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:54,800
do you put some shape around it it's a

1455
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:56,000
great term

1456
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,200
but i think there's a couple of things

1457
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,000
that you need to i like to use to frame

1458
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,280
what fusion actually means

1459
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,520
creating a brain which is a new

1460
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,160
the brain or or the the the core of how

1461
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,319
we're going to start to make decisions

1462
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:11,520
but we wouldn't understand what we want

1463
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,359
to start making decisions about so what

1464
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:15,040
are those shared goals and those shared

1465
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,720
outcomes across all those various

1466
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,000
functions

1467
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,480
right clearly there's in a digital world

1468
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:25,040
there's a massive and a clear

1469
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,359
crossover between

1470
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,520
our cyber security teams and our fraud

1471
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:31,359
teams and when we talk about online

1472
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:34,400
banking and we talk about mobile banking

1473
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:37,040
digital payments

1474
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:38,720
we can think about inside a threat

1475
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,720
there's clear crossover there from an

1476
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,559
insider threat or cyber perspective

1477
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,559
physical security uh function

1478
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,160
perspective

1479
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,440
i think we want to

1480
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,359
understand that there's a

1481
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,520
big data play to be had here which is

1482
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,359
the correlation of that data so bringing

1483
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:54,640
together

1484
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,240
not just the data sets but actually the

1485
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:58,720
unification of activities so coming back

1486
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:00,720
to that cross-function

1487
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,880
front to back operating model

1488
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:05,680
conversation i was just having

1489
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,839
making sure that all those inputs coming

1490
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:10,240
back to that 911

1491
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,880
sample or example making sure that all

1492
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,640
these inputs come into one control

1493
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:16,640
center where you can add traffic control

1494
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,240
and create better situational awareness

1495
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,480
and integrated action so much better

1496
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,720
detection and response capabilities the

1497
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,880
idea of fusion is to be able to move

1498
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,640
from this reactive state

1499
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,359
to a more proactive and predictive state

1500
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,920
and i actually do see a fusion center in

1501
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,319
my experience being separate to a sock

1502
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:37,839
you have your sock which is sitting

1503
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:39,200
there looking at all the alerts and

1504
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:41,280
monitoring doing the threat hunting

1505
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,440
identifying actual

1506
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,520
incidents or intrusions in your

1507
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,119
environment responding to that solving

1508
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:49,359
for that the fusion center is trying to

1509
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:50,880
be predictive

1510
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:53,119
it's trying to help you anticipate an

1511
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,640
attack before that attack happens

1512
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:57,040
whether or anticipate a fraud before a

1513
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,400
fraud happens and we'll talk about some

1514
00:52:58,400 --> 00:53:00,960
success cases that i've seen before

1515
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,640
so the converged

1516
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,079
security model

1517
00:53:04,079 --> 00:53:05,760
you heard me talk about the various

1518
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:07,119
functions

1519
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:08,960
that you might want to bring together

1520
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,559
there's a lot of value in those

1521
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,480
disparate data sets

1522
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,079
and actually bringing them back together

1523
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:15,920
bringing them together and analyzing

1524
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,680
that enriching that data with each other

1525
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,839
and external threat data external

1526
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:21,760
criminal related data

1527
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,720
you can really start to drive proactive

1528
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,000
uh

1529
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:28,720
models and and

1530
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,559
approaches to how you

1531
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:32,240
you know increase that situational

1532
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:34,079
awareness and

1533
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,400
uh you know really

1534
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,079
you know we talked about meantime detect

1535
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:40,000
mean time to contain that same process

1536
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,440
that same

1537
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,640
you know metric applies across all of

1538
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,319
those functions it's not just a cyber

1539
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:48,079
measure

1540
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:49,839
think about the co-location elements and

1541
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:51,119
i think this is really tough in today's

1542
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:52,400
world actually and

1543
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,160
you know i haven't run it off a fusion

1544
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,400
center in a remote working

1545
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,559
environment but in my experience it was

1546
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:00,800
about co-location getting these teams to

1547
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,800
sit together

1548
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,520
mixing those teams together so that

1549
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:09,040
the digital for the the digital

1550
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,880
forensics and incident response teams

1551
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,079
would hear what the fraud teams were

1552
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:13,680
talking about or would you know the

1553
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:14,720
threat teams would hear what the

1554
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,079
physical security teams were talking

1555
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,200
about and i'll talk about threat i don't

1556
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,599
mean just cyber threat i mean all threat

1557
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:23,359
so physical threats geopolitical threat

1558
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:24,880
you know social

1559
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,559
social economic risk and bringing all

1560
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,079
that in together because those

1561
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:29,760
conversations that they have in one

1562
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,520
fusion center where they're sitting side

1563
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,720
by side

1564
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:35,200
it spawns thinking it helps you join the

1565
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,799
dots i actually really think that today

1566
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,640
in that remote working world

1567
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:41,599
we'd lose a little bit of that

1568
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:43,119
cross-pollination of skill sets i think

1569
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:44,240
that's really important that's a great

1570
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,680
outcome that's a great benefit we know

1571
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:46,960
that we're fighting

1572
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,799
for talent today we know that there's

1573
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:51,200
this skill shortage so how do we start

1574
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,119
to

1575
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:54,160
you know

1576
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,920
understand some of those

1577
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,520
duplications that we might have across

1578
00:54:57,520 --> 00:54:59,440
those functions as an example we have

1579
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,119
investigations team and we have incident

1580
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,440
response or digital forensics teams they

1581
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,200
have some very transferable skills that

1582
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,680
we can tap into and we can help create

1583
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:09,920
some efficiencies in our operating model

1584
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,280
but also we can start to

1585
00:55:13,280 --> 00:55:14,960
engage our teams better because now

1586
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,280
actually a cyber person becomes a fraud

1587
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,880
person a physical security person

1588
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:20,400
becomes a threat person

1589
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,000
and our teams are being stretched

1590
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,520
they're learning more and they're

1591
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,040
starting to be engaged a little bit more

1592
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,559
i think that's a really great outcome

1593
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:28,799
because that's one way of

1594
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:30,799
maintaining and managing and engaging

1595
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:33,839
your team and retaining your

1596
00:55:33,839 --> 00:55:35,920
i spoke about the reducing uh reducing

1597
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,400
duplication and inefficiencies that's

1598
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:40,160
great because we'll identify that

1599
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:42,400
there's common elements across those

1600
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,920
functions and we can streamline that we

1601
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,520
can take cost out

1602
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,359
and i think a real important thing and

1603
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:50,160
this is really key i can't underestimate

1604
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:51,520
how important this is is the battle

1605
00:55:51,520 --> 00:55:54,079
rhythm and the coordination so making

1606
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:56,319
sure that you have a morning stand up in

1607
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:58,319
that fusion center what are we seeing

1608
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:00,240
across the environment

1609
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,480
and it could be not just

1610
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:05,359
uh you know like think broadly

1611
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:06,799
what's happening from a bad weather

1612
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:08,880
perspective do we expect bad weather to

1613
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,040
increase you know in in a certain area

1614
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,640
we're going to have to start thinking

1615
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,079
about closing branches if you start

1616
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,359
thinking about closing branches what

1617
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,880
does that mean from a physical security

1618
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,480
perspective is there activity we need to

1619
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,160
take there right so really increasing

1620
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,160
that situational awareness having those

1621
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,839
battle rhythms having a morning stand up

1622
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:25,839
having an afternoon stand up making sure

1623
00:56:25,839 --> 00:56:28,720
the teams are communicating effectively

1624
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,160
then understanding how we synthesize

1625
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:32,240
some of that information and enrich the

1626
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,040
various functions

1627
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,119
so what's right for your organization

1628
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:41,359
i've spoken about my experience in

1629
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:42,480
banking

1630
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:44,000
in two organizations where we pulled

1631
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,400
those elements together but no one size

1632
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,799
fits all you know i spoke about nbn who

1633
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:50,319
pulled i think actually they've got

1634
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:53,839
fraud together now um iag recently just

1635
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:55,359
pulled in their fraud function but they

1636
00:56:55,359 --> 00:56:56,400
just had the

1637
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,200
the you know their start in this process

1638
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,440
was uh physical and cyber

1639
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:02,559
but i think you need to figure out

1640
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:04,079
what's right for your organizations to

1641
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:06,000
do that you want to think about

1642
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:08,319
what your capabilities how mature are

1643
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:09,760
those capabilities

1644
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,280
and the key thing which i you know

1645
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,480
you've heard me talk about is that

1646
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:14,240
underlying data set

1647
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,720
bringing those data sets together

1648
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:18,319
understanding what data you do have

1649
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:20,240
because there's no point really starting

1650
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:21,359
on a journey

1651
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:22,799
where the underlying data sets aren't

1652
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:24,079
really going to help you then it just

1653
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:25,280
becomes a

1654
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,280
process element and it's more than just

1655
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:29,760
for me the the

1656
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,760
the

1657
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,240
the completeness of the fusion center is

1658
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,520
both the process and the data-driven uh

1659
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,760
capability

1660
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,040
understand what your biggest pain points

1661
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,880
are that's a great way to start that'll

1662
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:44,640
help you think about where do you need

1663
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,079
to start first what are those areas that

1664
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:49,200
make sense to bring together first

1665
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,720
what data does your organization have

1666
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,720
spoken about that more to the point what

1667
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,559
further do you what further data do you

1668
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:56,400
need do you know what your gaps are what

1669
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,240
would make you so as you're thinking

1670
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,720
about this journey in this roadmap what

1671
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:02,000
are the data sets that are going to give

1672
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,520
you biggest impact when i talk about

1673
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,200
biggest impact

1674
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,200
really it's about risk reduction

1675
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,440
so risk buy down

1676
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,319
data platform can't under can't i can't

1677
00:58:12,319 --> 00:58:14,720
underscore this enough

1678
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,480
i spoke about digital transformation and

1679
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:18,559
why our organization's going down this

1680
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:19,760
path

1681
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,040
fusion for me is a digital

1682
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,960
transformation for security environments

1683
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,359
or security teams security functions

1684
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:26,799
it's about us

1685
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:28,799
getting greater insights from the data

1686
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:31,280
that we use all that data that we have

1687
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:33,440
making much better

1688
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:34,960
security decisions

1689
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:37,200
faster security decisions

1690
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:39,280
ideally becoming proactive

1691
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:41,280
anticipating things before they happen

1692
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:42,640
becoming

1693
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:43,920
predictive and i'll talk about some of

1694
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:45,520
those things in a minute so how do you

1695
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,440
do that

1696
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:50,640
data science plays a big part that comes

1697
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,480
back to the operating model as well so

1698
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:55,119
my two experiences

1699
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:57,359
i owned the data science team i built a

1700
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:00,240
data science team at rbc

1701
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,760
and they were joined at the hip with my

1702
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,520
threat and uh threat management team

1703
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,280
i owned that which was fantastic because

1704
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,280
i could really prioritize that in an at

1705
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:11,040
nab i didn't own the data science team

1706
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:12,799
but ultimately you want to use data

1707
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,559
science big data analytics we know about

1708
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,000
this we've spoken about this we talk

1709
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,400
about how data is driving our decisions

1710
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,680
and driving the way that we operate

1711
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,319
today this is no different

1712
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:24,079
use techniques like clustering analysis

1713
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:26,319
neural networking it'll provide better

1714
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:28,480
insights and predictive analytics i'll

1715
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,720
give i'll give you some of those

1716
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,839
success stories in a minute

1717
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,040
so use cases and success stories

1718
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,160
a couple of things i've seen is

1719
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,160
preventative fraud indicators

1720
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,640
think about it in a digital world

1721
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,400
digital banking online banking mobile

1722
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,240
banking

1723
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,839
when you bring all these data sets

1724
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:50,400
together and these functions together

1725
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,960
we can see the entire data stream or the

1726
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:54,720
entire click stream

1727
00:59:54,720 --> 00:59:57,280
from the endpoint the the laptop or the

1728
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,760
pc or the mobile device

1729
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,680
all the way through to the actual

1730
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:03,920
transactions of the customer these

1731
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,839
things you have that whole entire

1732
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:08,240
lineage you can see all and when you're

1733
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,319
continually monitoring that entire click

1734
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:13,760
stream you'll start to identify outliers

1735
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:15,280
variances

1736
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,400
threats

1737
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,920
which will allow you to be a lot you

1738
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,440
know a lot more predictive in that

1739
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,839
downstream impact which could result in

1740
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:23,760
a fraud

1741
01:00:23,760 --> 01:00:24,960
being able to

1742
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,040
predict that fraud

1743
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,559
and reduce the impact on the customers

1744
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,319
what we want to do right that's the goal

1745
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:31,920
and actually what what you'll find is

1746
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,079
and you know we had the success at rbc

1747
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:35,760
where we actually

1748
01:00:35,760 --> 01:00:37,599
you know we lodged four patents when i

1749
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:39,200
was there for predictive fraud

1750
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,799
indicators which was fantastic outcome

1751
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:43,520
for us and significantly reduced our

1752
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,440
fraud losses as a result of the

1753
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:47,040
analytics and the insights that we're

1754
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:48,319
getting through this process or this

1755
01:00:48,319 --> 01:00:50,480
capability threat modelling enrich your

1756
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,240
own threat modelling process because

1757
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,359
you're going to have all this data

1758
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:54,400
available and you're going to see

1759
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:55,599
patterns you're going to see new use

1760
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:56,480
cases

1761
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,079
you're going to identify unknowns things

1762
01:00:58,079 --> 01:00:59,839
that we haven't seen before your threat

1763
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:02,720
modeling from a security

1764
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,640
and risk perspective and process

1765
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,799
perspective gets much better so you feed

1766
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:09,280
that back into your your your project

1767
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:10,640
process

1768
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,920
and your bau risk management process

1769
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,000
so now you're you know you're having

1770
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,000
this this complete cycle of these

1771
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,200
unknowns that you probably wouldn't have

1772
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:20,400
seen before

1773
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:22,160
and this this this

1774
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:24,160
now you have this path this gradual

1775
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:27,280
maturity of uplift as that as those as

1776
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,000
that modeling and those insights grow so

1777
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,799
it really does start to ramp uh your

1778
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,559
overall security posture

1779
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:37,119
insider threat i think that's a actually

1780
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:39,280
for me that's a quick win right so

1781
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,799
bringing together the physical security

1782
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:42,799
logs the logical logs and you'll start

1783
01:01:42,799 --> 01:01:44,559
to see anomalies really quickly i'm sure

1784
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:45,920
a lot of us sort of do some of that

1785
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:47,680
stuff today if you bring your physical

1786
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:49,599
logs in together

1787
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:51,680
opportunities and challenges

1788
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:53,440
so

1789
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:54,799
why should you do it so improve

1790
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:56,000
visibility

1791
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:57,920
efficiencies

1792
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,640
move from a reactive detective and

1793
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:02,799
reactive state to a more proactive state

1794
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:04,400
actually what you probably find is like

1795
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:05,680
i mentioned you're going to still have

1796
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:07,440
your socks who are there to

1797
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,119
detect and respond absolutely but you're

1798
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:10,880
going to have this analytics

1799
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,839
data driven capability that's going to

1800
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:16,240
be allow you to

1801
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:19,839
be more predictive be more controlled

1802
01:02:19,839 --> 01:02:21,680
optimizing value of existing systems

1803
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,680
right between those various functions

1804
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,359
that we spoke about this duplication and

1805
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:26,960
types of systems a really good example

1806
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,400
is case management

1807
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,160
right having one case management system

1808
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:32,559
across those functions enables a lot

1809
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:33,520
better

1810
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:36,160
handoff and visibility of

1811
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:38,400
information in an in an investigation or

1812
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,000
an incident

1813
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,000
it also reduces cost of your operating

1814
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,359
environment because now actually you're

1815
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:44,880
not running two different systems two

1816
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,480
different disparate systems you can say

1817
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,960
you know there's a cost out

1818
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:51,280
benefit there to be had

1819
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,880
improved organizational resilience

1820
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,720
ultimately that's what we're here for

1821
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:55,599
right

1822
01:02:55,599 --> 01:02:57,359
cyber security is great but cyber

1823
01:02:57,359 --> 01:02:59,520
security is

1824
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:00,960
i think

1825
01:03:00,960 --> 01:03:02,640
us as a profession have realized now

1826
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:03,680
that we're never going to protect

1827
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:04,880
everything that there is always going to

1828
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:06,000
be an impact

1829
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:07,440
you know the mindset now is around

1830
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:08,640
resilience

1831
01:03:08,640 --> 01:03:10,000
and i think it's an operational

1832
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,200
resilience it's just not a cyber

1833
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,640
resilience element for me when i talk

1834
01:03:12,640 --> 01:03:14,799
about bringing together that enterprise

1835
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:17,280
that integrated enterprise

1836
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:19,359
integrated model

1837
01:03:19,359 --> 01:03:21,599
uh expect challenges along the way and i

1838
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,520
can't underestimate i can't underscore

1839
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:24,640
this enough

1840
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,079
this is a massive change to how

1841
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:27,920
organizations work and like

1842
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,319
any change in any organization it

1843
01:03:30,319 --> 01:03:32,559
requires strong leadership it requires

1844
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:33,920
taking people on that journey and

1845
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,160
managing that organizational change the

1846
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:38,160
technology is sort of the easy part i

1847
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,079
think technology is getting easier

1848
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:42,079
change is getting harder and actually

1849
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,039
how do you get your organization to

1850
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:46,960
change the way that they operate it

1851
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,400
takes strong leadership and take strong

1852
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,760
leadership not just from a security

1853
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:51,760
leader but also from across the

1854
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:53,599
organization because we're going to have

1855
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,319
to

1856
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:55,920
you know people are going to lose some

1857
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:57,280
ground people are going to lose their

1858
01:03:57,280 --> 01:03:59,680
five times that they've built

1859
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:01,440
but we you know that's when it comes

1860
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,119
back to really having those shared goals

1861
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:04,400
and making sure that we're all brought

1862
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:05,599
in and we understand what we're trying

1863
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:08,000
to achieve

1864
01:04:08,960 --> 01:04:11,119
it requires so some of the challenges is

1865
01:04:11,119 --> 01:04:13,119
new ways on how you're going to start to

1866
01:04:13,119 --> 01:04:15,359
connect these dots so maybe introducing

1867
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:17,039
new technologies new capabilities like

1868
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:19,760
that data science learning function

1869
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:22,000
where to start

1870
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,160
so i think you know

1871
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,520
having done this a couple of times i

1872
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:26,640
think there's a couple of quick ones you

1873
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,480
can do that you can build on to take

1874
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,400
this forward one is

1875
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:32,400
identify those goals

1876
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,000
that'll be most relevant to your

1877
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:36,160
business not this not necessarily the

1878
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:37,680
security function get out and talk to

1879
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,200
your business leaders what are their

1880
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:40,400
biggest challenges what are their

1881
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,839
biggest concern about how do you

1882
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:43,599
demonstrate value to your business

1883
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:44,480
leaders

1884
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,520
identify three or four of those

1885
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,920
top goals that these various functions

1886
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,240
need to work together to achieve

1887
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,480
and that's going to start a process

1888
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:56,799
in that you know that that human change

1889
01:04:56,799 --> 01:04:58,480
process that i spoke about or that that

1890
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:01,039
organizational change process

1891
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:02,319
is going to start people thinking about

1892
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:03,920
and get them bought into that they'll

1893
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,359
start to see success and they'll start

1894
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:07,039
to see benefit

1895
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:10,000
start function start somewhere so in rbc

1896
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:12,400
as an example my peer who was the head

1897
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,000
of fraud uh

1898
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:16,480
we came up with fusion friday so

1899
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,880
every friday we'd get part of the cyber

1900
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,039
team and part of the fraud team and our

1901
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:23,440
data science team to sit together and

1902
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,079
you know we built that uh sort of

1903
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:28,000
organically over time it's getting those

1904
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,599
teams because those teams sat in

1905
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:30,799
different buildings they didn't really

1906
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:33,359
talk too much didn't overly communicate

1907
01:05:33,359 --> 01:05:34,319
actually what they found when they were

1908
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:35,440
sitting together and they were talking

1909
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:37,920
of us you know in one place with this

1910
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:39,359
the shared goals that they're trying to

1911
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:42,799
achieve it really built a esprit of core

1912
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:43,920
in the team

1913
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:46,640
and it really started to

1914
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:49,520
demonstrate benefit and learnings

1915
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:51,839
prioritize two or three key processes it

1916
01:05:51,839 --> 01:05:53,599
could be an insider threat piece it

1917
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:54,799
could be a

1918
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:57,119
you know

1919
01:05:57,920 --> 01:06:00,799
account takeover on online banking as a

1920
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:03,039
use case

1921
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:05,280
think about the handoffs between those

1922
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,680
use cases so what's the handoff between

1923
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:09,359
the digital

1924
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:11,520
forensics and incident response team to

1925
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,520
the fraud team and the investigations

1926
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:15,280
team how do you streamline some of that

1927
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,880
demonstrate value

1928
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,960
co-locate teams physically or virtually

1929
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:20,319
like i said i think it's a little bit

1930
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:21,760
difficult these days with the virtual

1931
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:22,960
environments

1932
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,799
but i'm sure there's you know good

1933
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:26,400
collaboration tools that we can use to

1934
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,799
solve for that

1935
01:06:28,799 --> 01:06:30,400
actively manage the change of people

1936
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,960
like i say the key thing here is not so

1937
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:34,319
much the technology change we can get

1938
01:06:34,319 --> 01:06:35,920
through that it's actually changing

1939
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,680
people

1940
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:39,839
i'll talk from experience you know some

1941
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:42,160
of the investigators and physical

1942
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:43,599
security team and even the cyber teams

1943
01:06:43,599 --> 01:06:45,200
they all have their own opinions and

1944
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,400
their challenges and they think that

1945
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,160
they know better than the other team you

1946
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,920
need to break that stuff down right and

1947
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:52,240
that takes strong leadership

1948
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:54,720
celebrate success regularly

1949
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:57,039
right tell war stories

1950
01:06:57,039 --> 01:06:59,200
you know motivate the team make sure the

1951
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,960
team understands the value of what we've

1952
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:04,960
done and where we're being successful

1953
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:07,039
so that's it for me hopefully that was

1954
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:09,680
semi interesting uh you know the key

1955
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,240
point for me is around i really see this

1956
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,039
as

1957
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:15,119
our own digital transformation and how

1958
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:17,599
do we get more value out of data

1959
01:07:17,599 --> 01:07:19,280
just as our organizations are trying to

1960
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:21,200
do that to grow

1961
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,200
and create better you know create

1962
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:26,000
revenue and grow their business

1963
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,760
we should be doing the same we should be

1964
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:28,799
thinking about our own digital

1965
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:30,720
transformation i think this is a great

1966
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:34,399
way to enable that thank you

1967
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,680
thank you

1968
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,200
and he finished with 21 seconds still on

1969
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:40,720
the clock that's the sort of accuracy i

1970
01:07:40,720 --> 01:07:42,480
like from netscope as they say mate

1971
01:07:42,480 --> 01:07:44,319
thank god it is fusion

1972
01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:45,839
friday now we are done for the day in

1973
