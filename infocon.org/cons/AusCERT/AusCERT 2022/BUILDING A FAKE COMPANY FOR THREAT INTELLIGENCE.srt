by colby from octopus deploy

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,880
uh colby actually ex oscert a while ago

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,160
as well and today colby is talking about

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,439
um

9
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,400
how to build um some honeypot goodness

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,080
how to build a fake company for threat

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,760
intelligence so please welcome colby

12
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:32,989
[Applause]

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,719
all right i'll make sure the clicky

14
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,040
clicks

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,879
we've got two clickers so i might be

16
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,519
dual wielding

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,599
this way

18
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,000
cool

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,480
so i'm talking about

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,320
making a fake business

21
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,280
um

22
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,480
messing around

23
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,440
a lot of software where i come from of i

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,800
used to work at ulster i mess around

25
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,280
with honey pots a lot in my spare time

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,520
um it's always been something that i've

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,360
really enjoyed but

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,119
um you always struggle to get like a lot

29
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:12,960
of leadership and stuff like that out of

30
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,240
honeypots

31
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,080
not a lot of people want to say here's

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,600
exactly what i'm doing and all of the

33
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,280
information because then they

34
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,280
burn all of the information for people

35
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,119
to know about

36
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,400
and it's something i've been wanting to

37
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,880
do for quite a long time to try to run

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,119
a whole like fake business

39
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,360
and see like how far down the rabbit

40
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,119
hole could you go with trying to run

41
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,680
like a more complex honeypot environment

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,360
as opposed to

43
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,799
opening a single port on a single server

44
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,119
and one of the big things which really

45
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,280
kicks me over the edge to say

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,920
i'm going to push this into a talk was

47
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,159
like the great reckoning

48
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,000
of log4j

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,600
which i'm sure a lot of people have had

50
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,720
to deal with

51
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:55,759
um

52
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,119
friday

53
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,880
finish lunch

54
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,000
chilling out

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,719
see like some blog posts and some edgy

56
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,920
tweet

57
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,399
and then you're like oh that's you know

58
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:07,920
that's not that bad we're not really

59
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,440
running java right

60
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,038
and

61
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,239
even though you're not running java you

62
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,920
still jump in you check all the logs and

63
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,680
you're like oh my god it's everywhere

64
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,160
and it's everywhere yesterday

65
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,360
um

66
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,040
and a big thing about

67
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,400
you know the company i work for

68
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,640
currently octopus deploy we're a

69
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,200
continuous deployment product

70
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,640
and so we have a bunch of marketing

71
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,040
people they love to jump out there and

72
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,040
say here's how our product integrates

73
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,040
with jenkins here's how it integrates

74
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,959
with team city all this stuff so we have

75
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,080
these things

76
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,239
out there public on the internet

77
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,239
so that people can see how it all works

78
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,480
so granted it's not the worst case

79
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,959
scenario but

80
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,680
we everyone has some java somewhere and

81
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,840
then there's also the the little bit of

82
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,599
java you don't know about because it's

83
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:54,720
always there

84
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,400
um so my big thing was focusing on

85
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,879
teamcity it's it's in java they can't

86
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,400
hide that for me

87
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,680
um

88
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,720
so essentially on the day

89
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,959
you have to go like you hacked mate

90
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,760
and they're like no bruvs probably not

91
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,000
and

92
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,480
it i get it it's like really complicated

93
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,000
you're a big

94
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
product and it can be handled in so many

95
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,360
different ways

96
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,879
and the version you're running is like a

97
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,120
few versions behind so it's so old that

98
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,560
you're safe you think

99
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,440
um

100
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,920
but no one can tell this stuff

101
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,519
immediately

102
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,040
and

103
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,799
basically going what do you mean probs

104
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,159
not like

105
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,080
we need this stuff started happening

106
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,120
yesterday

107
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,200
we need an answer straight away we can't

108
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,640
just wait for you to

109
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,440
you know mess around and do all your

110
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,200
disclosure and stuff we need to find out

111
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,000
if we're compromised right now

112
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,280
so

113
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,360
basically i set myself a goal of i want

114
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,640
to know

115
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,760
what is affected before anyone else

116
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,720
and

117
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,040
it's it's an ambitious goal so i

118
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,439
essentially set myself some scope

119
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,560
so

120
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,159
i set two different rules

121
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,439
um

122
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,360
so the first one was i called it an

123
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,599
experiment right from the start so it

124
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,920
means coming in with like a thesis and a

125
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,120
deadline

126
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,920
um

127
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,519
this is something where it is a rabbit

128
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,798
hole and you can just keep going down

129
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,079
forever this is maths normies not as

130
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,800
married as first sight and they always

131
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,240
go out of their way to call it an

132
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,400
experiment it's not just

133
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,680
you know

134
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,520
stupid tv show it's an experiment

135
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,080
and the second thing i said was

136
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,080
in the middle of an incident i don't

137
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,400
word good advisories

138
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,720
and kyle knows this first hand during

139
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,639
log4j

140
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,639
we have public integrations with

141
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,759
teamcity so it was very much

142
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,199
not

143
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,400
impacted

144
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,440
but we were running those log4j versions

145
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,199
so we had to push out an advisory and

146
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,199
anyone that was dealing with log4j you

147
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,600
know you had to deal with the log4j the

148
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,199
first time and the second time they

149
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,720
fixed it the third time they fixed it

150
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,520
and

151
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,960
i don't remember how many times they

152
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,800
fixed it in the end so i wanted

153
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,199
something where potentially i could get

154
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,280
use out of this thing if i pick

155
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,000
something that says my crown jewels like

156
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,639
a team city server which i know is for

157
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,199
so many people and if it's not that it's

158
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,080
a

159
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,400
ansible tower or

160
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,720
um jenkins server or something like that

161
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,120
or for some people our product i wanted

162
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,400
to be able to like

163
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,120
use get some information out of it

164
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,199
but while i'm in this like half-baked

165
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,120
state because you always are during an

166
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,759
incident

167
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,320
so the whole thing about crown jewels

168
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,039
the idea of setting up a very complex

169
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,240
honeypot

170
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,080
is a lot of work

171
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,479
and it is down to that whole thing of

172
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,560
there's only so much you can do you can

173
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,160
send yourself crazy running up like a

174
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,680
whole business and then you have to

175
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,880
start doing disclosures for that

176
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,120
business in response to that business

177
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,000
um

178
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,520
but essentially really narrowing the

179
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,759
scope and going what's one thing that is

180
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,800
really critical to your business be it

181
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,360
team city a jenkins server

182
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,440
it could be an octopus server like

183
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,919
ansible tower or something like that

184
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,639
but kind of narrowing the scope to

185
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:19,039
what happens when an o day is popped for

186
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,240
like one of these things

187
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:24,160
um and so obviously i'm talking about

188
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,479
honey pots so i just have like a little

189
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,720
cliff notes of what hottie pots are and

190
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,400
it's essentially something you chuck out

191
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,479
there which you're pretending to be

192
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,800
legitimate but often you're like opening

193
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,160
it up to attacks and that can be

194
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,639
making it vulnerable intentionally it

195
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,800
can be not and just like seeing what

196
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,479
happens waiting for those big o days and

197
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,440
stuff

198
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,520
um but it's mainly there for you to like

199
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,840
very thoroughly monitor it and get

200
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,759
visibility over attacks

201
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,000
um a really good thing of like

202
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,919
explanation of what it is is

203
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,960
lance um started off just open up a

204
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,319
linux server in like his living room um

205
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,639
to the internet and he said it so that

206
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:05,680
you could

207
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,960
communicate in but you couldn't

208
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,880
communicate out

209
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,039
and

210
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,039
you know eventually at some point

211
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,199
someone jumped in and they're just rmrf

212
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,560
and all this stuff and he got really

213
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,960
excited

214
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,520
so when we're talking about honeypots

215
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,720
i'm

216
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,479
very adamant to talk about levels of

217
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,319
interaction because when you say the

218
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,720
term honeypot it means so many different

219
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,120
things so many different people and you

220
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,960
know projects can be stopped before they

221
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,000
even started because of this level of

222
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,440
miscommunication

223
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,520
so the level of interaction you have of

224
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,160
like you have base level low interaction

225
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,000
and if you know you know anything on the

226
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,919
internet you're opening a port you're

227
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,680
listening on that board

228
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,759
and it's basically going down to the

229
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:54,720
port point of did someone try to connect

230
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,960
to this thing and that can be you know

231
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,280
very usable if you put it like inside of

232
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,360
your network somewhere where someone

233
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,879
maybe shouldn't be poking and prodding

234
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:03,919
around

235
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,240
and then sending off alerts

236
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,000
or sometimes you scatter them all across

237
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,879
the net and say who's being bad and

238
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:12,240
poking and prodding a bunch of things

239
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,639
they shouldn't be

240
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,319
and you slowly step up into medium

241
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,560
interaction honey pots so the thing we

242
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,400
did on tuesday for some of the people

243
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,960
that did the workshop we did a ssh based

244
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,080
honeypot

245
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,120
and it's not running a full shell it's

246
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,520
running like a pretend bash environment

247
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,039
where stuff can get in and do stuff and

248
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,320
you can actually

249
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,080
see what they're doing

250
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,240
um and let them execute a bit of that

251
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,320
stuff

252
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,958
and essentially we get to this point of

253
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,200
um i split it into different ways

254
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,480
of

255
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,880
uh public and private so talking about

256
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,080
private

257
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,959
um

258
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:51,519
going through that low interaction

259
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,279
and you can think of like where that

260
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,959
high interaction would finally get to

261
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:55,680
you

262
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,640
is just running a server like not doing

263
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,040
this intentionally vulnerable or any of

264
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,880
this stuff it's just like a full prod

265
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:03,920
server

266
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,839
and as you can imagine something that's

267
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,160
very low interaction so looking for port

268
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,240
scanning and if it's private on your

269
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,760
private network

270
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,560
very easy to action that alert like

271
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,800
someone is port scanning doing something

272
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,279
nasty inside of your network

273
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,600
that's very easy to action

274
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,080
and the ease of implementation obviously

275
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,640
gets a bit more complicated as the

276
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,959
honeypot gets more and more complicated

277
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,800
and the ease of action does get a little

278
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
bit more muddy because

279
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,200
whenever you have more information it's

280
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,440
most things to sift through

281
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,440
um and then

282
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,800
as well at the same time when you jump

283
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,160
over to the public

284
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,320
even if you're running this like cool

285
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,120
you know ssh level of interaction

286
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,680
honeypot someone jumps in runs a bunch

287
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,600
of malware

288
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,360
what do you do about that

289
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,120
i'm not saying there's nothing

290
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,519
but it's not as easy as you know

291
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,200
someone's inside of your private network

292
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,040
um and yeah talking about gary this

293
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,720
stage honeybot

294
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,079
um

295
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,160
you'll see a lot of stuff like this

296
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,399
it's like on a bunch of readmes for

297
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,760
honeypots

298
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,160
they don't really want to take

299
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,600
um

300
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,839
you know responsibility for saying this

301
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,519
thing is secure it's really down to

302
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,760
implementation because ultimately you're

303
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,000
letting bad people get in and do stuff

304
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,040
so this comes back to the exercise so

305
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,800
i wanted to build a fake company i've

306
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,760
always wanted to do it for a long time

307
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:34,110
and

308
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,680
[Music]

309
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,519
this is the kind of stuff i was thinking

310
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,760
about so i wanted it to be identifiable

311
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,920
as a company and not just a random

312
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,160
server sitting out there on the internet

313
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,800
so it had to have multiple moving parts

314
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,839
like a a public front-end web presence

315
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,000
and something that would try to mimic my

316
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,800
threat model at work so something which

317
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,959
was an australian business

318
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,320
on the internet

319
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,560
um so if you know say someone's

320
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,920
attacking them

321
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,920
it's pretty similar to the kind of

322
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,839
people that will be attacking me

323
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:07,120
and then essentially the whole thing of

324
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,600
cost effectiveness because

325
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,399
again it's an experiment so i

326
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,839
just went around and messed with a bunch

327
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,399
of stuff but if i am to like actually go

328
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,120
through and follow this through again

329
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,880
what was worth it what wasn't worth it

330
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,200
so

331
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,360
running up something like this

332
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,640
i messed around with a few different

333
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,120
ways of setting this up but ultimately

334
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,279
the easiest way was the easiest way

335
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,600
which is just running up a server

336
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,839
documented process

337
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,920
so going off this example i ran up a

338
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,160
team cd server i wanted to make it

339
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,000
actually do something so i set up a few

340
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,519
builds in there so it doesn't look like

341
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,880
just some empty server

342
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,959
in order for it to actually be a useful

343
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:53,839
honeypot i had to ship logs

344
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,920
and i've explicitly said ship logs and

345
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,120
flow logs

346
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,000
because um ship logs i mean sending

347
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,320
application logs off the host but then

348
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,639
also flow logs to see what kind of

349
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,240
network traffic this thing is doing

350
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,800
obviously back up everything assume

351
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,240
whenever you're deploying a honeypot

352
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,320
that it will be compromised but like not

353
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,040
in the good way in the breakout way

354
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,800
um

355
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,639
sprinkle honey tokens which is just a

356
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,200
bit of fun drop in like ss um

357
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,839
aws creds see if anyone ever tries to

358
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,480
use them and a lot based off that

359
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,519
um

360
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,519
i did mess around with a while i really

361
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,440
wanted to have a transparent http proxy

362
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,360
so i could see all the traffic going

363
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,279
outwards

364
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:38,639
and i did look at trying to put in an

365
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,120
explicit proxy but i really wanted malwa

366
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,680
to just run

367
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,639
and

368
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,120
a transparent

369
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,959
explicit proxy wasn't really letting me

370
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:49,920
do that

371
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,240
and then the transparent proxy team city

372
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,920
got very angry at

373
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,600
and messing around with certificate

374
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,839
trust for a whole afternoon i

375
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,160
essentially just spit the dummy and said

376
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,519
i'm just going with flow logs

377
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,839
memory

378
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:08,240
dumps i was running all this in docker

379
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,880
if you run docker in experimental mode

380
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,519
you can get memory dumps out of it they

381
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,519
say don't do that in prod but it's a

382
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,920
very easy way of getting memory dumps of

383
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,399
a container so

384
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,360
that was

385
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,160
there

386
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,839
i didn't have to use it in anger so i

387
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,680
can't really comment on

388
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,920
how useful that is but i think whenever

389
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,839
in doubt always have information

390
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:32,839
available

391
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,480
so circling back to the goal

392
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,560
obviously i'm generating a bunch of data

393
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,839
at this point

394
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,079
um but you do want to circle it back to

395
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,959
hopefully something actionable um

396
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:46,560
i like to talk about

397
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,199
you know iocs but i'm not going to

398
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,560
tackle the whole threat intelligence

399
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,000
thing because it's so many different

400
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,040
types

401
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,240
of data that makes up intelligence but

402
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,760
obviously if we could get something out

403
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,800
like a file hash ip domain url

404
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,680
um

405
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,360
from something that's maliciously

406
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,839
running on there that's very easy to

407
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:07,440
action

408
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,600
it would be really cool if i could get

409
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,560
some ttps like if i'm running team city

410
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:15,199
over there as a honeypot and team city

411
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:17,600
over here in production and they look

412
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,680
identical i would love to see what

413
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,120
they've come through

414
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,079
and do over on this server

415
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,360
because then i can check to see if the

416
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,519
same thing has happened over here

417
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,839
and especially

418
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:32,000
because why this is useful to run on a

419
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,079
different server and not say like a

420
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:35,519
production or a sample server or

421
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,800
anything like that

422
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,360
is devs are messy and noisy

423
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,399
and

424
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,800
i think anyone can attest to

425
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,959
how annoying it is when you're trying to

426
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:46,959
respond to an incident and you go

427
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,480
through and you're like oh that's

428
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,639
definitely malicious like who the hell

429
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,920
would ever do that you're like oh it's

430
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,399
the devs

431
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,480
um and so this is where i'm kind of

432
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,480
going into the concept of a honey nut

433
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,920
it's exactly what you think it is it's

434
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,399
multiple honey pots in a network

435
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:05,680
i'm kind of doing it less in the

436
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,760
traditional sense traditional sense

437
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,160
might be you set up one type of honeypot

438
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,760
and distribute it across several

439
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,519
different networks and that's where you

440
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,440
get those really cool stuff like the the

441
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,920
map of the world with like the angry

442
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,800
countries and the angry colors and then

443
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,160
the good countries and the soft blues

444
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,399
um this is more just trying to run like

445
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,160
a complex environment with multiple

446
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,519
things in there

447
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,040
um and then aggregate all that

448
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,759
information on one spot

449
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,680
so what else mess around with was having

450
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,680
a team city doing builds

451
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,600
obviously i am interested in my own

452
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,759
product because i would love to find out

453
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,759
what bad people would do if they got a

454
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,800
hold of it

455
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,079
so i'd jams that in there

456
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:49,920
and also for

457
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,040
i

458
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,199
for like a front-end interface like if

459
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:54,560
you want to have a business you have to

460
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,160
have a front-end website

461
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,120
um i chose wordpress because i really

462
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,040
wanted to

463
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,560
like i would love to have someone get

464
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,759
into there

465
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,839
and i had a lot of sprinkled things

466
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,560
around to say please move laterally

467
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,040
spoiler i never got anyone to move

468
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,759
laterally from wordpress but i chose

469
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,399
wordpress because it's very enticing to

470
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,720
script kitties stuff like that

471
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,560
you know eric pinkerton

472
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,839
well-known script kitty

473
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,160
so essentially this gets into the point

474
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,000
of incident response in a complex

475
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,120
environment

476
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,920
and it's sounding awfully a lot like my

477
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,040
day job

478
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,800
and the whole

479
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,040
like second point i had was cost

480
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,199
effectiveness

481
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,639
in terms of setting up stuff like

482
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:41,920
central logging

483
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,639
file system snapshots memory dumps that

484
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:48,320
was all very easy in terms of

485
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,079
how i would respond to that in a

486
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:52,399
production environment you have to take

487
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,800
into account so many things like

488
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,720
has there been data breaches

489
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,800
has there been like a data integrity

490
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,480
issue um

491
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,160
you know has this affected my

492
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,079
availability but when it's a fake

493
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,240
business i don't care

494
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,520
because there is no customer data

495
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,520
i can tear down the whole thing and

496
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,039
bring it back up in a second from my

497
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,679
snapshots and no one is going to winch

498
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,559
to me if the server's down for a while

499
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:22,480
so that was my way of reining it in

500
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,039
i hate this slide because it represents

501
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:31,280
so much work for so little that goes

502
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,520
into a presentation

503
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,640
creating a social media presence sucks

504
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,880
and

505
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,799
yeah thank you

506
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,200
um i spent a lot of time trying to set

507
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,520
up fake people with a fake

508
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,480
inter um you know front end twitters

509
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,320
stuff like that

510
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,799
and i did it in a way where i had set up

511
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,400
the whole environment

512
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,960
logging everything and i wanted to

513
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,360
stagger anything that i did so what

514
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,520
happens when you create a business page

515
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:04,320
on facebook can you measure that in the

516
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,280
logs

517
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,039
and i think the answer is you need more

518
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,679
followers to be able to see that

519
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:10,799
measurement

520
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,200
and i don't think buying a bunch of fake

521
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,039
followers is something that i morally

522
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,280
want to do or

523
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,960
would be people that would click on my

524
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,720
links

525
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:21,679
so

526
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,840
ultimately what i circled back to this

527
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,280
is

528
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,480
i don't think without a huge significant

529
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,520
investment

530
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,000
creating a fake social media presence is

531
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,760
viable

532
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,520
but one thing i did do

533
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,000
um was general activity so going back to

534
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,280
like that wordpress website and

535
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,840
teamcityserver i did try to make it look

536
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,520
like it's a real thing

537
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,400
um

538
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,000
you know you set up a fake web hosting

539
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,559
company and it's like hey we're secure

540
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,480
we use this team city to build all of

541
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,120
our servers

542
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,720
um

543
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,240
this is some of the fun stuff that i was

544
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,000
messing around with it was kind of

545
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,919
therapeutic to write all of the things

546
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,679
that you think are just horrible

547
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:02,960
practices

548
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,640
and created as a business

549
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,080
um

550
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,280
yeah again

551
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,960
here's a hyperlink to our team city

552
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,360
server

553
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,640
um

554
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,799
and so kind of on the note of all of

555
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,200
this stuff one thing that i did have the

556
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,120
most fun messing around with

557
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,200
is if you're familiar with the concept

558
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,200
of opsac

559
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,799
i don't know if this is a coin term or

560
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,720
not but

561
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,240
the most fun for me was messing around

562
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,919
with oops sack

563
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,559
which is basically the polar opposite of

564
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,799
operational security so i was trying to

565
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:39,280
take anything that would lead to

566
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,679
something bad normally in a business

567
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:42,720
and just

568
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,919
face plant into it directly myself

569
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:46,960
um

570
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,640
and it was great because you had the

571
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,400
whole environment and you could measure

572
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,760
what would happen afterwards

573
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,559
my opinions are my own

574
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,840
i think pastebin could do a better job

575
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,799
at trying to stop malicious

576
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,240
activity

577
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,320
is all i will say um but doing

578
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,880
um i i simply started with just chucking

579
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,039
the website on pastebin and that was

580
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:14,880
immediately you could measure and see

581
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,120
who's scraping paste bin who's visiting

582
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,240
my site like the second it goes up there

583
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,200
um

584
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,280
showdown

585
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,880
obviously anything i put up there i'm

586
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,640
not blocking any public scanners and

587
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,360
stuff like that i very much wanted

588
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,039
everything i have to be

589
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,240
searchable

590
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,720
google showdan anything you could do to

591
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,679
find my environment because the idea is

592
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,360
oh day pops

593
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,960
everyone goes

594
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,240
i'm going to look for all of these

595
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,159
servers running this thing i'm going to

596
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,400
go hit that

597
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,320
just chucking it in url scan just

598
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,200
anything i could think of um

599
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,280
the cred dumps was unfortunately a

600
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,400
little bit lackluster where

601
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,200
you create a fake cred dump and you know

602
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,200
you have a login page for your business

603
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,600
and you dump a bunch of fake creds

604
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,679
and you kind of expect someone to at

605
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,440
least try one of them

606
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,320
um

607
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,280
in all this time no one has tried my

608
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,760
fake creds so maybe they'll come out in

609
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,240
collection six or whatever which will be

610
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,080
the next one it might be sitting in

611
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,919
someone's back pocket i surely hope no

612
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:23,120
one paid very much for it

613
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,720
um just a bit of like fun stuff of

614
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:29,440
posting like and about us url to pay

615
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,640
spin

616
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,360
just while we're on it is

617
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,880
seeing some of the requests that come

618
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,120
through straight after you do that

619
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,520
one of the weirdest ones to me is like

620
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,240
the slackbot link expanding user agent

621
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,559
so obviously

622
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,520
this url that i've posted to pastebin in

623
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,880
less than a minute has ended up in

624
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,400
someone's slack channel

625
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
and for all i know that person may be

626
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,240
here that's in that slack channel

627
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,039
but

628
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,880
you're playing a dangerous game sending

629
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,640
everything unless there's someone

630
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,400
manually reviewing and they're like

631
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,159
what's this i'm going to post this to my

632
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,880
friend in slack as a joke in less than a

633
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,880
minute i don't think so so i think it's

634
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,440
something automated and i would love to

635
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,760
find out whoever's doing that but

636
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,720
um

637
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,679
just

638
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,840
obviously weird stuff

639
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,360
people messing around with python

640
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,600
requests libraries they're obviously

641
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,240
doing some scraping

642
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,400
kind of at the same time you have like

643
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,840
another business here that's doing like

644
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,840
some threat intelligence stuff

645
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,320
um you know kind of look them up

646
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,760
and obviously they're looking for like

647
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,120
sensitive information that's being

648
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,080
leaked

649
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,120
um

650
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,200
and then i think this is where i started

651
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,760
to run into noise if you start to run

652
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,919
into people looking for publicly known

653
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,400
vulnerabilities and stuff like that

654
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,960
i have no radio.txt

655
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,280
just getting random http posts

656
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,600
obviously full of malicious payloads

657
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,600
and then just trying to get random

658
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,440
environments

659
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,880
so

660
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,039
i would definitely classify the last

661
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,480
three here as

662
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,320
just random scanning

663
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,120
but just in that short moment right when

664
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,640
i went to payspin

665
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,960
um i had those immediate hits and it was

666
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,919
actually less than i was expecting

667
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,960
and then obviously

668
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,200
you know anything you put out there is

669
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,120
going to show up in showdown

670
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,639
and it's the good thing

671
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,640
this is where i circle back to

672
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,320
some of the stuff of

673
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,760
how

674
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,400
how would it be best to run a complex

675
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,799
honeypot like this so ultimately i have

676
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:45,760
a

677
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,039
a server

678
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,760
running just like any other production

679
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,919
server

680
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,400
it raises this question of should i even

681
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,080
update this server if i want it to run

682
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,679
as a honeypot

683
00:23:57,679 --> 00:23:59,600
and it's an interesting question and i

684
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,039
guess it ultimately ties back to what

685
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,360
are you trying to get out of it for me

686
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,520
i'm an internet responder i want to get

687
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,440
instrument response information out of

688
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,600
it so i want the version to be exactly

689
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,120
the same as what i am running in

690
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,440
production

691
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,320
i did try dialing back the version

692
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,640
in retrospect i should have run at a

693
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,559
old version for a few weeks first and

694
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,880
then upgraded but i did it in a reverse

695
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,400
order

696
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,640
but i noticed no

697
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,720
different in scanning

698
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,120
after i changed the version

699
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,720
i was really hoping

700
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:35,120
for that to be the new hot thing drop in

701
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,559
team city in

702
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,559
like the six or so months i was running

703
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:44,080
this through but it was pretty much bau

704
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,600
um the other thing is like whether or

705
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,200
not to run an antivirus on something

706
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,320
like this

707
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,520
um

708
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,919
you may immediately say

709
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,679
no don't run an av

710
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,000
but an av might be a really good way to

711
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,480
get alerting and to measure

712
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,400
how is this going to happen

713
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,000
in this environment compared to my

714
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
actual production environment

715
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,480
but then at the same time you do want to

716
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,720
let them get as far as they can to find

717
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,039
out ultimately their end goal

718
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,120
so i did lean on the direction of like

719
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,600
no av we want to see if bad stuff

720
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,000
happens

721
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:20,880
um this is kind of like a thing i was

722
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,440
running sumo logic for all of the log

723
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,880
aggregation

724
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,080
um it was just kind of like a example of

725
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,720
a very clean server

726
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,000
without any of those pesky developers

727
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,120
with a

728
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,360
with a scheduled build you can very

729
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,000
easily set up a prediction of

730
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,919
log events like i'm not counting

731
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,000
specific metrics or anything like that

732
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,400
just number of log lines

733
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,279
it's very very predictable and you can

734
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,880
tighten it way tighter than what you

735
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,799
ever would in production and say if this

736
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,640
does something which it doesn't normally

737
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:55,360
do

738
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,158
send me an alert

739
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,480
and i have this massive list of ips that

740
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,120
have gone through scanning this thing

741
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,279
these ones aren't necessarily scanners

742
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,840
but it's interesting going through

743
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,000
these are the private ips

744
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,840
on the right

745
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,360
the 153 is the team city server and the

746
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,600
239 is the wordpress server

747
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,960
these public ips for these servers were

748
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,279
generally in the same range

749
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,279
they were hosted in aws so lots of

750
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,720
people are always poking and prodding

751
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,360
aws ivs

752
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,960
and just kind of sorting it by source ip

753
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,400
i was expecting

754
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,720
a way more

755
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,960
of like this server

756
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,279
like this random remote ip hit both of

757
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:46,720
my servers

758
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,520
but

759
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,840
generally across like the whole thing

760
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,480
it was about this where

761
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,640
i only have one in line six and seven

762
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,000
it's the same ip that's hit both servers

763
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:59,440
and

764
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,440
it was a really interesting data

765
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,400
to pivot from because you would say

766
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,880
you know if this has hit

767
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,039
a bunch of times

768
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,240
so like a

769
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,080
the number in the file column is just

770
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,200
like a count

771
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,480
so how many http requests has smashed

772
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,399
against my server so

773
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,720
obviously line six and seven

774
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,360
it's probably a scanner because it's hit

775
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,840
both servers a bunch of times

776
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,760
and every now and then you'll get one or

777
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:30,240
two hits here on just one server but

778
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,000
what was really interesting to me was

779
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,360
when you have

780
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,240
just one server and get smashed a whole

781
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,039
bunch of times but nothing on the other

782
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,880
and i think that is down to maybe some

783
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,399
of the complex environments for people

784
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,480
that are running scanners out there

785
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,080
um

786
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,559
yeah i

787
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,200
was trying to essentially pick out to

788
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,240
see if there were like targeted scans

789
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,760
maybe pivoting from showdown or

790
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,559
something like that

791
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,880
um some of the other just like fun

792
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,039
things is when you're trolling through

793
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,640
all these request logs looking for those

794
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,080
scanners

795
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,679
you find a lot of stuff

796
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,440
which isn't intended for your

797
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,640
application

798
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,679
so

799
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,679
obviously teamcity

800
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,440
is having this

801
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,120
java dummies bit

802
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,919
about this http request

803
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,440
and you kind of look through it

804
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,960
index.php

805
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,279
teamcity isn't in php so we definitely

806
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,200
know it's not for us

807
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,120
looking through there's some keywords in

808
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,520
there like you know hello think php kind

809
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,880
of gives it away

810
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,120
um you can take that out start looking

811
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,720
for that very quickly find that there

812
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,240
was like a vulnerability in this

813
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,039
framework which is quite popular chinese

814
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,399
framework apparently

815
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:43,279
um

816
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,520
and people are going ham scanning for

817
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,120
this thing i will say

818
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,919
so

819
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,279
hopefully no one's running this or if

820
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,480
you are it's patched

821
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,279
um so kind of circling back of

822
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,000
of the experiment um what did i get out

823
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,320
of it

824
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,279
one of the things i wanted to do

825
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,440
at the start was make it identifiable as

826
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,559
a company

827
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:07,520
and

828
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,200
this was like

829
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,520
it's it's a very hard metric to measure

830
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,679
if you're effective on this or not in

831
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,000
like the six months that it's ran

832
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,120
um

833
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:20,640
it hasn't had any like major you know

834
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,799
breaches or anything like that

835
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,399
but in terms of

836
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:26,880
just having like a public web page with

837
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,799
like a contact us page and stuff like

838
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,960
that you can pretty quickly look at that

839
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,840
and go

840
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,520
that looks like a company

841
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,120
in terms of trying to set up a social

842
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,720
media presence

843
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,360
it's a lot of effort and it's not going

844
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,279
to get very far unless you want to

845
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,520
become like a marketing person in your

846
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,640
slide gig

847
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,360
for

848
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,039
zero payoff

849
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,600
um multiple moving parts was super high

850
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,320
effort having like team city

851
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,440
other servers in there like wordpress

852
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,840
it ended up being

853
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,679
quite a lot to look at like having those

854
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:02,080
multiple public ips is a great pivoting

855
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,039
point

856
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,000
but

857
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,080
if i would go back and do this again i

858
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,399
would potentially maybe just

859
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:10,720
take something like a teamcity server

860
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,720
and run a bunch of them

861
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,080
instead of running a bunch of different

862
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,399
things

863
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:21,120
um in terms of trying to copy what my

864
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,360
threat model is

865
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,520
i kind of put this down as low effort as

866
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,360
long as i kept this scope

867
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,159
of

868
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:31,039
you know my initial kick off was

869
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,880
log4j happened

870
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:36,159
we're on team city i'm scared and part

871
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:37,520
of it in the back of my brain is what

872
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,520
i'm actually saying when i run that

873
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,399
is

874
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,880
you know i'm running at a company

875
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,520
servicing a product and we also have a

876
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,880
big sas platform which is it's no secret

877
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,880
it's written in.net and if the same

878
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,200
thing happens in the dot-net world i

879
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,880
would love to be in a much better

880
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:55,919
position

881
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,279
than the people

882
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,240
um

883
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,519
having to respond to log4j

884
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:04,000
um so essentially scoping it down to

885
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,760
what are your your crown jewels um

886
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:08,640
was

887
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,279
quite effective i think

888
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:13,600
so the overall cost effectiveness as

889
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,360
long as you did those things it would be

890
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,760
low effort but it is a complete rabbit

891
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,080
hole that you can just dive down

892
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,760
um

893
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,279
yeah one of the things i was super happy

894
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,840
with was that strict activity alerting

895
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,799
um

896
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,519
one thing that i had chatted with ramis

897
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:31,440
quite a lot about was

898
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,000
how do we alert because essentially i'm

899
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,360
trying to run like a full production

900
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,480
server

901
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,159
and i want to say

902
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:39,919
when has it been breached

903
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:42,159
and if i have that answer

904
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,000
surely every single incident responder

905
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,840
would want that magic silver bullet

906
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,840
answer and the silver bullet is just

907
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,519
don't have any developers and you have

908
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:51,200
you have no activity it's very easy to

909
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,640
find out when bad stuff happens

910
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,519
and just having a clean environment

911
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:58,320
is

912
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,960
a very useful tool in my experience for

913
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,600
the people that have had to respond to

914
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,679
that situation where

915
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,159
big vulnerabilities come out

916
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,480
it's in the wild you have that oh no

917
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,640
moment and obviously they're probing

918
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,039
your public stuff but then maybe you

919
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,440
have a waff or maybe you have an av

920
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,039
and you go

921
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,159
i don't think we're affected

922
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:23,840
but it's going to take me a long time to

923
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,159
do that investigation but having that

924
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:26,960
like

925
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,440
clean environment over on the side gives

926
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,600
you like a great comparison point

927
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,519
without all of the extra noise of

928
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,480
everyday work

929
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:41,919
so targeted attacks unfortunately i'd

930
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,120
never got

931
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,919
specific targeted team city attacks i

932
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,840
had my fingers crossed for a new cv to

933
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,000
drop but it didn't arrive and had to end

934
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,200
it eventually

935
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,120
attacks did not change when the version

936
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,760
changed did wordpress get targeted yes

937
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,919
but

938
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:01,360
i'll say i

939
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,600
i dropped wordpress

940
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,559
and yes you see wordpress scanning

941
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,799
but after a certain amount of time it

942
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,519
did increase of the specific wordpress

943
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:12,559
scanning

944
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,240
so does that mean that people are going

945
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,039
out specifically targeting team city

946
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,640
probably not maybe they're waiting to

947
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,120
get to one on a private network

948
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:25,639
but by god they're hammering wordpress

949
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,760
so yeah that basically brings it around

950
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,039
to the end

951
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,130
anyone have any questions

952
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:40,210
[Applause]

953
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,000
yeah we do actually have a question

954
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,360
you're getting feedback before they shut

955
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,440
you down here um

956
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,559
and i thought i was going to read out

957
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,399
the questions you gave me

958
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,840
to um but i couldn't read your typing so

959
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,200
so there's a question from clinton it

960
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,360
says uh did you consider making a breach

961
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,679
disclosure for your fake company

962
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,519
in line with other people other people's

963
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,440
talks i didn't consider that i think

964
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,039
that's a really cool idea but at the

965
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,040
same time that does come back to all of

966
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,760
the

967
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:12,960
the social media aspect of it was the

968
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,719
most draining and this was like a

969
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,239
personal project

970
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,159
and there's nothing worse than spending

971
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,520
your personal time on facebook and

972
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,960
twitter

973
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,320
and it was just

974
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,000
yeah it was a lot to go through and i

975
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,119
didn't want to

976
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:27,280
potentially end up into like some spicy

977
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,879
waters where i have like the government

978
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,639
contacting me saying was your business

979
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:34,760
breach and i'm like what business

980
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,320
cool so you i think you mentioned um aws

981
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,639
did you look at other places to host

982
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:41,839
your um

983
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:46,560
honey honey company no just aws cool

984
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,560
of course and what about host telemetry

985
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,079
you look at actual telemetry from the

986
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:52,320
host like um yeah that was also a really

987
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,560
good metric um and again that was the

988
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,320
kind of thing where i did mess around

989
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,119
with tuning that very specifically the

990
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,839
cpu was very

991
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:04,079
noticeably you know spiked when i needed

992
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:05,680
it to spike and didn't spike when it

993
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,560
didn't

994
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,720
so it's something that i was also

995
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,640
looking at alerting on

996
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,400
um

997
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,839
there's some funny questions here yeah

998
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,280
so um jamie jamie's asked a question

999
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,040
and it said is there anything you didn't

1000
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,480
do because of time constraints maybe

1001
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,920
i would say the

1002
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,079
one of the pipe dreams i wanted to mess

1003
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,000
around with was

1004
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,119
memory

1005
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,160
analysis so like doing memory dumps

1006
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,800
when you have like a cron just dumping

1007
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,839
memory on a server which is like a clean

1008
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,440
environment

1009
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,520
you should in theory be able to try to

1010
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,440
look at like differences out there like

1011
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,920
if you're pulling strings out what's

1012
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,280
in there today that wasn't in there

1013
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,880
yesterday and then you also have a

1014
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,640
comparison point maybe of like another

1015
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,839
server

1016
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:53,680
i would have loved to have had something

1017
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,680
