hi guys this is in a bra I'm a security

2
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:07,830
enthusiast who loves to do a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:10,170
security engineering this year at multan

4
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:12,450
i'll be talking about automated mobile

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,480
application security testing with mobile

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">Satori framework this talk features the</font>

7
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,980
all new<font color="#CCCCCC"> and improved dynamic analyzer</font>

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,720
and couple of cool cells like how you

9
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,240
can make your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own devices to perform</font>

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:26,130
dynamic analysis and the new API tester

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,799
which is capable of performing security

12
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,029
analysis of the backend server of the

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,669
mobile applications that you are having

14
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,170
so this impetus term is built with the

15
00:00:32,668 --> 00:00:36,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple of use cases which are really</font>

16
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:38,700
practical in the mobile ecosystem so

17
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,769
from now<font color="#CCCCCC"> on mobile security framework is</font>

18
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,809
an all-in-one printer sync framework

19
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:45,210
which is capable of performing static

20
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:49,440
analysis dynamic analysis network

21
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,789
analysis and a ps3<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so about mal</font>

22
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,680
con it's all the best technical

23
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,579
conference in<font color="#E5E5E5"> India so see you all guys</font>
