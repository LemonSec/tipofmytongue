1
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,480
hello everyone my name is Chris Janko

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:08,210
and today I'm going to present on some

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:10,309
comprehensive HECO techniques in mobile

4
00:00:10,309 --> 00:00:13,100
networks that we met during our security

5
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,720
monitoring projects and the security

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,330
assessment project so I work with

7
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:24,140
positive technologists and we work with

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,449
mobile operators helping them to protect

9
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:29,060
so it's security assessment and security

10
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:31,220
monitoring projects that just are

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,219
getting the information about what

12
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:36,530
attacks are going on in the real world

13
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:41,719
so like being a vendor will be created a

14
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:44,620
telecom attack discovery product just to

15
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,359
help the operators to get information on

16
00:00:47,359 --> 00:00:51,850
from where they are being attacked so

17
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,339
actually the ss7 that is the protocol

18
00:00:55,339 --> 00:00:59,690
that is the mobile telecommunications

19
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:05,049
were built from and it has a lot of

20
00:01:05,049 --> 00:01:08,000
insecurities because it was developed in

21
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,150
70s where nobody cared about security

22
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,080
because it was close network and only

23
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,390
PSTN on the landline operators had the

24
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,590
access to it and when the mobile

25
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,080
networks start in developing it was like

26
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,480
2004 start of the 21st century and the

27
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:32,000
they the the stack of protocol sigtran

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,790
or was develop and it it really became a

29
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:41,870
big problem so our team our team has

30
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,260
showed the world as how it is easy to

31
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,780
compromise Facebook accounts whatsapp

32
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:50,630
telegrams and whatever just with the

33
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,760
method of interception of the SMS

34
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:58,040
message and after that again we did a

35
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,810
research is it possible to get the

36
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,810
access to the cryptic cryptic horn

37
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:06,340
wallet and again the method worked and

38
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:10,878
actually no one cared no no no no any

39
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,310
operator cared about this problem they

40
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:17,099
know they're there but it wasn't just

41
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,650
concerning the money so their parade

42
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,750
doesn't lose the money he doesn't care

43
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:27,390
and in 2017 in May the the lodge

44
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:29,849
operator had to admit that she had a

45
00:02:29,849 --> 00:02:33,829
two-step attack you know and the hackers

46
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:37,769
for first of all they were able to get

47
00:02:37,769 --> 00:02:40,950
the malware two smartphones all the of

48
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,689
the users and laptops and so this way to

49
00:02:45,689 --> 00:02:48,599
get their login accounts and after that

50
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:50,609
having the access to this seven network

51
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:53,489
they were able to intercept a one-time

52
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:55,939
password codes for the transactions and

53
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:59,970
for the victims at night not to be able

54
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,310
to read that something's going on so

55
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,859
they they just transferred a really big

56
00:03:04,859 --> 00:03:08,129
amount of money and after that the

57
00:03:08,129 --> 00:03:10,139
operators started really starting to

58
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:15,989
care so as I told the ss7 networks were

59
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:19,469
developed in 20th century it was in

60
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:22,560
1970s and no one cared about security

61
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,599
and with the developing of mobile

62
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,870
telecommunication in 21st century there

63
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,260
were in mobile mobile networks starting

64
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,379
to appear a lot of virtual operator was

65
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:41,060
providers where you added services and

66
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:45,120
the vi ran the protocol the ss7 over IP

67
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,669
was developed and when you have

68
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:49,949
something our IP is no longer secure so

69
00:03:49,949 --> 00:03:55,739
and all the vulnerabilities that were in

70
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:59,099
the ss7 they came to to the sigtran

71
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:04,379
over IP so and being accessible to

72
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:09,120
anyone you know one of the main problems

73
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,329
that you even with with the operators

74
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:17,909
having like newer newer networks like

75
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:21,839
LTE 4G actually they have the same

76
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,840
vulnerabilities but even if the

77
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,529
operators only for only 4G should it

78
00:04:28,529 --> 00:04:30,360
just have to support

79
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,030
the seven for the Roman interconnection

80
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:35,729
and that that Roman interconnection is

81
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:38,219
really big problem because like for the

82
00:04:38,219 --> 00:04:41,250
manufacturer if it has like an axis for

83
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,120
the ss7 sigtran you can reach any

84
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,639
network through any protocol for the

85
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,060
Roman purposes you know so you just have

86
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,340
to get the excess over this seven and

87
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:58,469
that's going to be enough so how the

88
00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:00,960
operators started care so they started

89
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,569
to implement different solutions so it's

90
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:07,229
like an SMS home routing we'll explore

91
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:09,900
this thing later like security

92
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,930
configuration of the devices start

93
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:16,139
implementing the ss7 firewalls security

94
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:20,550
monitoring and so on and of course like

95
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,370
the most advanced they started to

96
00:05:23,370 --> 00:05:25,289
perform security assessment that's

97
00:05:25,289 --> 00:05:27,419
really important to know if your network

98
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:30,210
is being really well no bro just you

99
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,360
know by having an expert trying to ban

100
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,389
test it and during security assessment

101
00:05:39,389 --> 00:05:41,879
is often coupled with security

102
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:44,940
monitoring projects just to just get

103
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,639
information if network is really being

104
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:53,550
attacked by the real world so before I

105
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:57,389
go to the techniques that we came that

106
00:05:57,389 --> 00:05:59,099
techniques that allow to bypass security

107
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:02,669
measures I just need to explain

108
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:04,589
something about the basic notes and

109
00:06:04,589 --> 00:06:06,719
identifiers that I used in mobile

110
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:10,560
network so the first is Emma sighs the N

111
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,449
that's mobile subscriber integrated

112
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:15,060
services digital number so they sell

113
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,969
just like a normal number that we used -

114
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:20,669
okay give you my number and just like

115
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:24,779
Emma sighs the end so the every MSS then

116
00:06:24,779 --> 00:06:27,599
every number is strictly strictly

117
00:06:27,599 --> 00:06:29,969
connected to another identity that's

118
00:06:29,969 --> 00:06:32,159
IMSI international mobile subscriber

119
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:35,879
identity so actually the normal person

120
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:40,199
does not know is IMSI but this identity

121
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,649
is used just for the mobile networks to

122
00:06:43,649 --> 00:06:46,629
connect to the stations and so on so

123
00:06:46,629 --> 00:06:51,069
it's just operator equipment the STP

124
00:06:51,069 --> 00:06:55,479
that signaling transfer point that's the

125
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:59,559
note just very often set on the border

126
00:06:59,559 --> 00:07:02,080
of the network and it just received all

127
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,059
the external traffic coming from another

128
00:07:04,059 --> 00:07:07,539
operator so the HLR home location

129
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:10,509
register let's note that contains a

130
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:13,240
database of home subscribers of home

131
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,379
operated subscribers and the next note

132
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:20,469
is MSC VLR so they're just basically

133
00:07:20,469 --> 00:07:23,919
like two nodes that are very often put

134
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,259
in just one equipment so that mobile

135
00:07:26,259 --> 00:07:28,119
switching center alongside with a

136
00:07:28,119 --> 00:07:31,629
visitor location register so the visitor

137
00:07:31,629 --> 00:07:32,709
location register

138
00:07:32,709 --> 00:07:34,270
that's a database that contains

139
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:37,360
information about subscriber profiles

140
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,499
that is currently being served but this

141
00:07:40,499 --> 00:07:45,009
commutator so and it's not only home

142
00:07:45,009 --> 00:07:47,199
subscribers it can be visiting

143
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,050
subscribers from other networks and the

144
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:54,550
MSC MSC is the commutator that provides

145
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,969
access to the the SMS messages while

146
00:07:57,969 --> 00:08:01,300
wheel our process is more of voice

147
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,529
communications so and the SMS see that

148
00:08:05,529 --> 00:08:07,990
just SMS sensors is used for message

149
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:14,319
delivery then we go to our first attack

150
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,879
that is SMS from rosing bypass so first

151
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,459
of all I would like just to tell how is

152
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,959
the normal image deliveries going

153
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:25,930
without the SMS from Rose indecision in

154
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:32,318
place so the external SMS center sends s

155
00:08:32,318 --> 00:08:33,938
arrived for a same message

156
00:08:33,938 --> 00:08:36,099
just send routing for Sam he just is

157
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:38,740
basically asking I have a message for

158
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,509
your subscriber just tell me what

159
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:43,208
commentator he's she's been served by

160
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:47,980
and what is his IMS identifier just to

161
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,920
properly rule the message and the SDP

162
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,790
routes this message to the HLR to the

163
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,190
database and that database

164
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:00,130
have all the information about the IMS

165
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:03,310
identifier and the MSC address that's

166
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,690
being served by for the subscribers so

167
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:12,780
actually that in this way the external

168
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:17,440
SMS Center gets the information real IMS

169
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,790
identifier and the MSC address and this

170
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:26,200
information can be used for like more

171
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,950
complicated attacks just the main thing

172
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:33,280
in telecom telco networks is just to get

173
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,250
the IMS identifier of the subscriber so

174
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,530
you like everyone knows the number but

175
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:41,320
no one knows the IMS identifier so

176
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:45,760
that's how it is performed in operation

177
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,830
network without SMS home routing

178
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:52,000
decision in place after that the

179
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,840
external SMS Center sends MT SMS message

180
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,390
using that Rea LMS identifier and with

181
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,370
SMS text and the message is being

182
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,800
delivered to the MSC and then up to the

183
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:08,110
subscriber so when the SMS from routing

184
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:10,900
decision is in place all the process go

185
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:16,030
so again external SMS Center sense as a

186
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,040
right for some message addressed by

187
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,440
MSI's day and just the mobile number and

188
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,380
the STP route this message not to the

189
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:27,520
HLR but to the SMS router that's just a

190
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,340
special device that is put in operating

191
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:34,480
networks and that SMS router he actually

192
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,330
creates a correlation between real I am

193
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:43,300
a side NT fire and a fake and he's not

194
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,730
reply and will real MSC that this

195
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,530
serving the subscriber he just respond

196
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,290
with his own address often pretty often

197
00:10:50,290 --> 00:10:54,100
so and the external SMS Center now gets

198
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,820
like I am a scientist and the SMS router

199
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:01,240
address instead of the MSC commutator so

200
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:06,580
and if that external SMS Center would

201
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,500
have been like a malefactor

202
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,870
it's not going to be able to perform

203
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:13,330
further text because he has a fake fake

204
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:17,529
addresses so and after that the empty

205
00:11:17,529 --> 00:11:21,520
SMS message comes to the STP and the STP

206
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,750
again transfers this message to the SMS

207
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,990
router with that fake identifiers so

208
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:31,870
that actually the first step of the SMS

209
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,910
delivery with the SMS home wrote in

210
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:38,040
place and after that the SMS router

211
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,440
initiates a sy4 same procedure to the

212
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,180
HLR and actually the HLR replies with

213
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:48,610
real dresses but it is inside the

214
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:50,710
operation network so it's okay it's not

215
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,830
going to be disclosed and the SMS router

216
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:58,950
does the SMS delivery procedure and

217
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:04,150
that's the second step so how it does

218
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:09,370
work against hackers so the hacker sends

219
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,220
us right for some message just trying to

220
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,529
obtain IMS identify ops of the

221
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:17,680
subscriber and the MSC address and the

222
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,529
message goes to the SMS router and SMS

223
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:27,580
router replies with fake data so after I

224
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,990
go right to the attack I just have to go

225
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:34,750
and explain something about a numbering

226
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:41,140
plans so there are some numbering planes

227
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,740
that are used in telecom networks so the

228
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,760
first one is e dot 164 so that's the

229
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,709
numbering plane that is used for MSI's

230
00:12:50,709 --> 00:12:53,230
then we will already explore it before

231
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:57,550
and a GT GT is like the same number the

232
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,550
same mobile number but that is used for

233
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:02,410
network equipment so it has the same

234
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:06,190
format so like it consists of country

235
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,850
code so for indeed it's 91 country code

236
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:12,040
and network destination code so here for

237
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:15,880
example I took just 1 2 3 4 so it just

238
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:22,950
contains four in the of four digits that

239
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,640
they just get you the net net net record

240
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,300
and the rice digits are like MobileLite

241
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:35,380
identity so it's like the rest changing

242
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:38,640
part of the number the mobile number and

243
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,000
we have another numbering plan a dot 212

244
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,290
as for MSI identity it consists of

245
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:49,480
mobile country code and mobile network

246
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,850
code so that's not like country code and

247
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,670
network destination code that's like the

248
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,970
codes that are again mapped to that a

249
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:02,320
dot 164 numbering plan but then are the

250
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,590
same so for India we have I guess two

251
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:06,850
mobile country codes

252
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:10,060
that's 404 or 405 so I use just the

253
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:13,090
first code that was used as 404 for

254
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:16,570
example and mobile network code just I

255
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:20,200
took here for example 99 so and the rest

256
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:24,490
again the part that identifies the

257
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:28,840
subscriber so and we also have the third

258
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:33,850
numbering plan that is e dot 214 that

259
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:36,100
consists of country code natural

260
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,220
destination code and the rest part is

261
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,380
taken from the ims identity so actually

262
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:47,040
this numbering plan is used like for

263
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,020
update location messages and just for

264
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:56,260
for the operator to be able to get from

265
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,050
where the request came so as you can see

266
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:02,530
there the first part of the number is

267
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,470
the operator part so like the the

268
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,390
network equipment knows where to root

269
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:11,230
and after the operator gets it on its

270
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:12,790
STP

271
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:15,580
based on that the rest the rest part of

272
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,300
the number he just realized to what

273
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:24,089
database the HLR through the the message

274
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,340
okay okay

275
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:30,970
so like every everybody device the STP

276
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:34,060
has a routing table and it has some

277
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,150
rules like ways route

278
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:39,940
so when the external sa-7 message comes

279
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,450
[Music]

280
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:45,240
hitches the aid the SDP explores the

281
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,150
message and decides how to proceed so

282
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:50,610
when when he sees the numbering plan

283
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:58,290
like edad 214 he just decides he just

284
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,750
processed the message to another like a

285
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,450
global title translation table and he

286
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:06,240
just decides to what age you are it

287
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,810
should wrote the message so actually

288
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:13,860
normally the SSRI for some message is

289
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:17,430
just used being addressed in e.164

290
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:23,040
numbering plan and when the SMS router

291
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,529
SMS home rolls in decisions are in place

292
00:16:25,529 --> 00:16:31,200
so when they see like an and a dots 164

293
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,540
numbering plan and opcode s arrived for

294
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,750
sm code of operation they just transmit

295
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,870
the message to the SMS router and if

296
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:45,390
they actually if they're the STP routing

297
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:49,290
table is not been designed or configured

298
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:53,640
good the SDP can just first look at the

299
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,720
dot 214 numbering plan and just wrote it

300
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:07,429
directly to the HLR so as you can see

301
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:12,420
they the MSI's the end should be

302
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:14,670
actually in a normal packet it should be

303
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:19,949
given in on mat level and SSP signaling

304
00:17:19,949 --> 00:17:23,179
connection control part level so and

305
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:27,390
like how this attack actually works so

306
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,950
the malefactor

307
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:35,660
using that e 214 numbering plan and just

308
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,860
having a random IMSI identifier and

309
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,870
address by MSI's day and the message go

310
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:45,150
to the STP the STP looks like it's

311
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,150
numbering plan each 214 you just don't

312
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,000
care that s RI for SM

313
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,400
he will not forward the message to the

314
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,560
SMS router and the message goes right to

315
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:00,270
the H lar and the the HL are actually

316
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:03,600
replies with real information so it gets

317
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,600
like real MMS identifiers really messy

318
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,110
dress that is being served that is

319
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:15,390
serving this subscriber okay so and how

320
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:17,700
it should be how should be prevented so

321
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,310
and the STP routing table should be

322
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:25,080
modified and just our concern like first

323
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,330
of all the code of operation so if it's

324
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,520
s right for SM no matter what numbering

325
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,920
plan is used you should just read the

326
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,290
message to the SMS router not right to

327
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:36,360
the edge you are and the SMS router will

328
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:41,790
reply with fake date so and we have

329
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:44,790
another type of SMS from Rossum bypass

330
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,530
attack that we're going to explore an I

331
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:54,630
so during one of the security monitoring

332
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:56,390
projects we came across this situation

333
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:00,060
so we have been operator headquarters

334
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,700
and the regional operator so the

335
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,040
malefactor

336
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,980
just tries to get that MSI identify from

337
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,890
the original operator so he sends SR I

338
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:13,290
for some message addressed by Emma sighs

339
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,690
the end they still receive this message

340
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:19,500
he transfers it to the SMS router SMS

341
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,350
router replies with fake data so and the

342
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:24,270
SMS router address so everything works

343
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:28,860
fine but during some investigation the

344
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:34,380
malefactor then just sent this message

345
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:38,220
to the headquarters STP headquarters and

346
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,770
that's been addressed by the HLR the

347
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:46,110
database GG and the packet consists has

348
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:48,690
an Emma size the end number for the

349
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,000
subscriber so the SDP of the

350
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,680
headquarters receive this message and

351
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,650
he's like no it's not for me but it's

352
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:58,020
for the original operator so he just

353
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,230
regions meets the message to the STP of

354
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,190
the regional operator

355
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:07,000
and the that STP just perceive this

356
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,130
message as trusted because it came from

357
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:11,470
the operator headquarters and he just

358
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,760
transmitted this message

359
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,860
exactly to the HLR and of course the HLR

360
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,350
replies to the malefactor with real data

361
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:22,570
so it's an SSRI for a same message

362
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:26,380
containing real msi identifier and the

363
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:29,560
MSC address that that the subscriber is

364
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:34,330
being served by so how to prevent the

365
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:38,110
situation so of course as a first step

366
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:40,210
you should fix routing from the

367
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,880
headquarters SDP and like child's

368
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,910
network because all all external as

369
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:48,040
reference and messages should be routed

370
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,080
to an SMS router in the meta Ward and

371
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,570
actually this type of situation can rise

372
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:58,360
after some hardware or software updates

373
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,360
in the networks and that's why security

374
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,890
assessment and vulnerability management

375
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:07,300
is important part of security process so

376
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:12,510
the next tech its position enhancement

377
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:17,560
so at any time the subscriber is being

378
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,880
served only only by one cell station but

379
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:27,040
by stations are you but the the mobile

380
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,710
device is just listening to a lot of

381
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:32,110
base station that is under radio

382
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:37,480
coverage so and like if you are able to

383
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:41,470
get all the base station that the the

384
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,170
mobile network sees you can just refine

385
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:47,080
the position the location of the

386
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,790
subscriber so and then when you just

387
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,890
before them like patient discovery tags

388
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,320
using like provide subscriber info

389
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,740
message you just only get the one cell

390
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:02,560
ID that is currently serving the the

391
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,710
cell that is used by by station just

392
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:10,540
only one and during one of our security

393
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,400
monitoring projects we just came across

394
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,310
a strange situation so here you can see

395
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,990
the

396
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:26,150
during during 4 hours we have like a lot

397
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:28,550
of attacks on one-on-one exact

398
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:31,760
subscriber and it's unstructured ss

399
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,850
notify that that were not performed

400
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,670
properly because the that was in abort

401
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:40,610
coming and this attacks came from

402
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,440
different countries you know that you

403
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,620
can see on the map and so we

404
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:49,130
investigated it and we got like here we

405
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:52,670
have a three minute interval on the

406
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:57,020
timeline and we noticed a really strange

407
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:59,780
thing so it's provide subscribing for it

408
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:02,390
that's a a message that is used for our

409
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:06,380
location discovery and after that it

410
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,770
goes unstructured it says notify aborted

411
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:14,810
attack and again it comes the the triple

412
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,000
comes with the provide subscriber in for

413
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,330
completed procedure so we were really

414
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:22,820
interested and we just decided to

415
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,980
recreate the position refinement check

416
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:30,140
so as a first step we just make a

417
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,960
provide subscriber info procedure to get

418
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,850
the salad is that is currently serving

419
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:38,210
the subscriber so we got it's like all

420
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:43,220
DFB as a second step we just performed

421
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,400
that unstructured assess notify and we

422
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,360
as you can see we put the USS D string

423
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,280
missing so it's like a silent uses the

424
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,110
message for the subscriber not to be

425
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,870
able to just get that she's being hacked

426
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:00,200
or something and as you can see the

427
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,070
Wireshark just perceived this packet as

428
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:07,700
a malformed but what's going on in the

429
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,390
real world

430
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:12,470
the MSC wheel are actually processes so

431
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:16,550
she precedes that procedure and she just

432
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:18,980
sends patient requests to the base

433
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:22,930
station and

434
00:24:24,909 --> 00:24:31,879
to get some cell IDs identifiers from

435
00:24:31,879 --> 00:24:36,549
the base station and the base station

436
00:24:36,549 --> 00:24:40,240
just responds with the page in response

437
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:45,860
containing cell ID identifier and it

438
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:49,610
just gets a return Aurore with the local

439
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:51,649
weather unknown alphabet so it's like a

440
00:24:51,649 --> 00:24:55,460
malformed packet the equipment cannot

441
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,429
proceed it properly but actually the MSC

442
00:24:58,429 --> 00:25:00,470
will are well it shouldn't it should

443
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:03,799
just send right away abort message he

444
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:07,090
just touches the radio access network so

445
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:12,369
here I'll just I'll meet some some

446
00:25:12,369 --> 00:25:16,159
messages on the radio access network

447
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:21,200
interface on a the face and it just

448
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
touches the radio access network and

449
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,539
sense rich on roar message back to the

450
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:30,529
MSC wheeler and it's transfers it to the

451
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,899
request in network so actually it would

452
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:35,539
have really been better if the MSC will

453
00:25:35,539 --> 00:25:37,820
are just aborted the operation just not

454
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:40,249
touching the the radio access network

455
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:45,889
equipment and actually after this we

456
00:25:45,889 --> 00:25:48,249
send another provide subscriber in for

457
00:25:48,249 --> 00:25:53,440
request and we get another cell ID so

458
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,629
having dead cell IDs in place we just

459
00:25:56,629 --> 00:26:00,110
put it on the map and as you can see so

460
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:02,509
we have two red circles that's just a

461
00:26:02,509 --> 00:26:05,059
radio access coverage of that base

462
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:07,580
station that we get information on and

463
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:10,940
just the right the green green circle is

464
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:15,230
the most the coverage of the subscriber

465
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:18,710
area and like the green point is the

466
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:21,110
most probable position of the subscriber

467
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:26,899
so having several cell IDs in place you

468
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:29,690
can refine the subscriber location

469
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,230
properly

470
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,460
soin as I already said the Wireshark

471
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,100
treats this packet as a malformed while

472
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:44,320
the equipment precedes the operation so

473
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,500
fixing this problem in the network

474
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,320
equipment can just take really a lot of

475
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:56,540
time because like it's a it's a really

476
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:59,390
long and difficult process so and there

477
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:01,750
are there actually means to block this

478
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:05,720
messages because either provide

479
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,460
subscriber info message or unstructured

480
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:10,490
assess notify message they're just treat

481
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,100
it as a category to messages in a cordon

482
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:18,290
and this gsm a fast i are 82 standard

483
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:20,740
and you just you just need to block this

484
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,150
category to illegal messages you need

485
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:25,160
using any possible means so it can be

486
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,160
like fixing you on the side of the

487
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:30,230
equipment or just implementing some

488
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:38,030
firewalls and so on so and I guess the

489
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:43,100
last attack but today it's firewall

490
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:52,640
bypass so how they the ss7 fire world

491
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,160
works against hackers in the operating

492
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:59,120
network so here comes the update

493
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,920
location message so it's like a

494
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,750
subscriber arriving through a new

495
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,750
operator Network and this message

496
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,390
contains free identifiers so it's I am a

497
00:28:08,390 --> 00:28:11,660
side NT fire it's for I took the same

498
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,720
Indian subscriber we explored the

499
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,640
previous slide it has the MSC and the

500
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:22,550
wheeler address that are very open the

501
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:25,880
same because the MSC and wheeler are

502
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:29,390
really often sit in OneNote so and it's

503
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:32,320
just the races of the requesting

504
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,540
requesting note as it should be in real

505
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,890
life and the s7 firewall get this

506
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:44,050
message and it just

507
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:46,800
it has a table like a location table

508
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,100
that consists of amasai identifiers like

509
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,470
wheeler address and last time their date

510
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:56,490
location came so if this update location

511
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:59,610
just in you like the firewall didn't

512
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,380
have any update location on the that

513
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:03,720
particular subscriber it just creates a

514
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,510
record containing the IMS identifier

515
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:11,570
wheel our address and the time so and

516
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:16,770
and after that if another another date

517
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:19,740
location comes like it's he I guess it's

518
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:23,970
11 o'clock and again it contains the IMS

519
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:26,940
identifier MSC and wheel are addressed

520
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:30,360
but already the air from another country

521
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:35,520
so 49 code was for from Germany and they

522
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,940
two six one that's from Madagascar and

523
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:45,300
the s7 fire world just explores this

524
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:49,830
message and he gets the country code

525
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:53,550
from the wheel our and just puts it to

526
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,800
another table that that is a velocity

527
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,770
table so it just checks is it possible

528
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:02,550
to travel between the given period for a

529
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,970
subscriber it just has the numbers for

530
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,920
like traveling all over the world so

531
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,920
it's like from germany germany velocity

532
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,870
is zero so every update location is

533
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:15,630
processed even if it's fake if it even

534
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:19,010
if it's fake stay like registration but

535
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:22,590
from germany to madagascar the minimum

536
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,690
time interval as you can see like 8

537
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:31,770
hours and he compares the numbers so he

538
00:30:31,770 --> 00:30:35,310
gets 49 from the previous table and he

539
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:38,670
gets to 6-1 from that request coming

540
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:43,730
just just in one hour difference so he

541
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:48,000
calculates one hour one hour just less

542
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,560
than eight hour and he just loves so

543
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:58,170
that that's how it works and as you can

544
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:03,570
see the MSC address is never used for

545
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:08,870
the table for that exact farewell so and

546
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:12,030
what you can do this so the the hacker

547
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:14,840
the hacker sends a request that has an

548
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:19,080
MSc address that is his fake address

549
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,920
madagascar and he puts the we lr of or

550
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:27,380
like a real wheel are like German and

551
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:30,870
the firewall just treats the message

552
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:34,590
just get the code from the wheeler

553
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:39,600
so it's 49 49 from the request so it's

554
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,660
velocity zero velocity is zero and the

555
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,790
time difference is just one hour so he

556
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:48,120
just proceed the message you know so he

557
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:51,390
says it's okay and what's actually going

558
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:58,140
on from the subscriber view here so the

559
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,950
update location comes and the equipment

560
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:08,910
precedes the operation and the HLR HLR

561
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:12,960
updates it database containing this MSC

562
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,040
and vlr identifier so the MSC is just

563
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:21,600
the the hacker one that he owns and the

564
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,540
the wheeler is the real one so and from

565
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:27,930
a subscriber view like all the Voyles

566
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,790
calls they're working through a real

567
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:33,150
equipment while the SMS messages like

568
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:38,010
the mt SMS and empty SMS messages they

569
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:41,810
come to the fake MSC of the hacker so

570
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:44,760
like a while the voice calls cannot be

571
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:47,160
intercepted in this way all the SMS

572
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,230
messages with one-time passwords and so

573
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:54,510
on can be intercepted so decision is

574
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:58,020
pretty it's pretty clear the ss7 fire

575
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,420
world must check both the wheeler and

576
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,990
the MSC addresses in all incoming of the

577
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:06,600
application messages just to prevent

578
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,390
this situation

579
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:15,390
so as our research world just having a

580
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:18,210
security tool in place is just not

581
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:20,880
enough and the security is just not

582
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,310
about the number of tools it's just a

583
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:25,530
process so you have to approach it

584
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:31,140
really in a process way so we should

585
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:33,690
take best practice from IP security in

586
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:36,030
terms of configuring network devices

587
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:38,400
like using standards and so on so

588
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,530
actually in the operational networks

589
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,520
there are a lot of configuration

590
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:46,470
mistakes and so on and security

591
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,090
assessment vulnerability management

592
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:51,330
security monitoring that's just a really

593
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:54,780
really good part of the security process

594
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:59,250
in telecom networks so I guess that's it

595
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:02,210
your questions

596
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:13,409
howdy STP routing table works and how

597
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:14,909
they carry numbers and they calculate

598
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:17,699
the numbers sorry STP doubting tables

599
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:20,580
STP routing tables so it contains the

600
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:22,679
information about the subscriber so it

601
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:26,010
has a routing table so whenever he gets

602
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:26,909
a message

603
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:30,810
he just explores it and based on certain

604
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:33,000
certain parts of the message he just

605
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,929
transmits to the appropriate HLR so like

606
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:40,940
the the message that is rotated in Edo

607
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:44,100
214 numbering plan it contains the

608
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:46,699
operator I operate a part that is

609
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:50,250
country code and network destination

610
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:55,139
code so and the rest part is like an

611
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:57,420
identity of subscriber and the SCP has

612
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:00,240
an information about all the subscribers

613
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,730
and which subscriber belong to which HR

614
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:05,460
so he just treats she just get this

615
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:08,190
chunk and routes to the appropriate age

616
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:12,830
ler can we prove a stupid outing table

617
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:16,010
well compromise ik equipment it's

618
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:20,220
actually comparing to the ss7

619
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,650
vulnerability it would be

620
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:24,860
mum's much much difficult more difficult

621
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,560
than just getting access to the ss7

622
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,600
networks and perform attacks because

623
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,210
yeah you may but it's going to be just

624
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:33,490
difficult there are a lot of

625
00:35:33,490 --> 00:35:35,630
vulnerabilities in this ever natural you

626
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:38,600
just can explore and you know you you

627
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,870
you just can get access like for not not

628
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:44,300
much for money amount of money so I

629
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:53,090
think it's the easiest way yeah so all

630
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:55,790
of the mention attacks works on ss7

631
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:59,210
right yeah so an attacker needs to how

632
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:01,010
Isis open access in order to launch

633
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:03,410
these attacks yeah yeah so I wanted to

634
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,660
know how easy it is for a common man to

635
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,020
good as a soon access okay

636
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:11,030
that's a good questions you know like

637
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:13,640
three years we explored this situation

638
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:18,220
and we just contacted some third world

639
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:23,630
operators in Asia or Africa I can't even

640
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:26,690
recall you know and they were able to

641
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:31,160
get the the really literal contract side

642
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:35,960
we just didn't continue for like $3,000

643
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,680
per month so that's not such a big

644
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,140
amount of money and actually in against

645
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:47,750
November of last year the the company I

646
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:50,210
cannot really remember the name they had

647
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,790
the same experience experiment but with

648
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:55,610
the operator in Europe and they were

649
00:36:55,610 --> 00:37:00,920
just asked for like 10 10 K so I guess

650
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,380
three years ago it was a little bit

651
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:06,710
cheaper yeah but it's just just a matter

652
00:37:06,710 --> 00:37:08,990
of money and you just can use any

653
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:13,280
operator with legs laws just to get

654
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:20,740
there thank you any more questions

655
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:27,650
so this brings to the end of this talk

656
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:29,690
so give him a big round of applause

657
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,250
because this was a great research

658
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:35,889
[Applause]
