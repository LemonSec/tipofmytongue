hello<font color="#E5E5E5"> grafton on ladies</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and gentlemen</font>

2
00:00:06,819 --> 00:00:14,449
I'm Michael<font color="#E5E5E5"> Advani</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Oh here to talk about</font>

3
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:19,220
DevOps tech or rapid security in the AWS

4
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:21,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">cloud so my co-presenter actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Rajesh</font>

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:25,698
<font color="#E5E5E5">some honey he could not be here today</font>

6
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:29,448
he's traveling on work oh yeah just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

7
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:31,820
little bit about us so both of us we are

8
00:00:29,449 --> 00:00:35,210
consulting with a company called<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font>

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:38,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">works or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> logician me work out of our</font>

10
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:42,920
Pony office<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm a devops engineer he's a</font>

11
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:44,360
security consultants been around in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:49,660
oven around in the industry for about

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,660
five years and Rajesh about 25 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

14
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:59,530
so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me get started directly also</font>

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:02,090
DevOps sake well there was sex I think

16
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:05,659
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is of course my personal opinion</font>

17
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:07,609
that DevOps as a word itself has various

18
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:12,829
definitions across different

19
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:15,770
organizations so I just try and take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

20
00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:20,719
dig at what my definition of the object

21
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:24,710
is ah it's basically bringing what oh I

22
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:29,719
understand it is to bring the dev the

23
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:33,559
ops and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the security role in 21 are not</font>

24
00:01:29,719 --> 00:01:35,809
separated as four teams idly not even

25
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:39,770
separated at an individual level so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

26
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:44,420
have every individual doing all the

27
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:48,670
three roles and possibly we feel that

28
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:53,389
this is critical to agile development

29
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:57,859
you cannot really or scale beyond<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

30
00:01:53,389 --> 00:02:04,149
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> point if you if you maybe</font>

31
00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:07,538
deviate from these principles and our

32
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:10,580
principles around these are basically

33
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:13,060
that everyone security needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

34
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:16,390
collective collaborative

35
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:18,819
illusion and we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make the</font>

36
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:22,200
decisions early and that we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

37
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:26,679
right people to be making the decision

38
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:30,670
enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our principles our series of</font>

39
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:35,500
philosophies so let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me just get directly</font>

40
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:39,790
to what we have done<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we've come up</font>

41
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:46,290
with a test automation sweet<font color="#E5E5E5"> or for the</font>

42
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:48,910
AWS cloud we identify some our security

43
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:52,900
recommendations or that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> came up with</font>

44
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:55,600
and we have basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> built the sweet</font>

45
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:59,680
surrounded and integrated it in our CI

46
00:02:55,600 --> 00:03:03,940
pipeline the sources of our

47
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:08,590
recommendations has been the CIS AWS

48
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:13,900
foundations of various security best

49
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:17,260
practice documents of AWS and other well

50
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:20,560
well renowned forums as well as a lot of

51
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:23,350
personal experience so I have been a

52
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,560
part of a project for a data center to

53
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:28,510
cloud migration for a global consumer

54
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:33,130
electronics brand it was a marketing

55
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:36,578
platform and we had to migrate a fleet

56
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:40,010
of about approximately 125 servers from

57
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:47,290
the DC to a cloud solution

58
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:47,290
ah directly getting into code now so

59
00:03:48,310 --> 00:04:07,970
what so this is an open source project

60
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:11,450
that or we have launched people my

61
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:14,810
question what house is<font color="#E5E5E5"> different from</font>

62
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:19,190
something like<font color="#E5E5E5"> uh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Netflix's or security</font>

63
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:22,010
monkey sure this is no ways even close

64
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:24,979
to the verbosity to the scale that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

65
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:28,729
security monkey can handle this is just

66
00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:33,050
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we came up with a minimal</font>

67
00:04:28,729 --> 00:04:38,210
a set of security recommendations which

68
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:40,610
we believe i can easily cater to the

69
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:43,250
requirements<font color="#CCCCCC"> of whatever your project</font>

70
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:45,590
might be however<font color="#CCCCCC"> large or small this is</font>

71
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:49,669
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i have implemented on my</font>

72
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:52,280
personal AWS account as well and the

73
00:04:49,669 --> 00:04:54,370
cost implications of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> i basically</font>

74
00:04:52,280 --> 00:05:02,539
pay approximately two dollars a month

75
00:04:54,370 --> 00:05:07,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's that cheap so all what we basically</font>

76
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:10,070
configure this application to do is have

77
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,310
a set of 16 so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a lot there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

78
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:16,340
a lot of tests that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have written or</font>

79
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:22,970
not all might be valid for everyone to

80
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:26,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">use case so all you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do is select the</font>

81
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:29,599
best that you want virgin or that you

82
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:34,639
want to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> executed you can disable any</font>

83
00:05:29,599 --> 00:05:39,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">test that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you would like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Yom it and give</font>

84
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:43,430
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> a run i'll actually trigger a run</font>

85
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:49,520
right away so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is our CI pipeline</font>

86
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:55,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm using a tool for go CD as a CI I'm</font>

87
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:57,950
triggering it or right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now I just second</font>

88
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,690
let's let's see how what are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the results</font>

89
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,690
of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular test run</font>

90
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:32,029
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> macally in the meanwhile can you</font>

91
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:34,009
cover what kind of things in the area

92
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:36,769
either security monkey or your to

93
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:46,909
recover and what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the things to check</font>

94
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:50,389
sure so the aspects that are we work

95
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:52,669
from tata motors<font color="#E5E5E5"> vkw switch you know</font>

96
00:06:50,389 --> 00:06:55,569
quite a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of apps where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting</font>

97
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:58,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">in there aww sure but from this security</font>

98
00:06:55,569 --> 00:07:01,639
bundle whatever you offer as a just

99
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:06,289
generic to all<font color="#E5E5E5"> customers so in our in</font>

100
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:10,579
our code writer or developer can have

101
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:12,919
another container for the client

102
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:15,249
specific where do we want to build up

103
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:17,089
some additional security features which

104
00:07:15,249 --> 00:07:19,459
applications which a roasted in a

105
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:22,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">double-edged slow i'm sorry i'm not sure</font>

106
00:07:19,459 --> 00:07:25,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gotta question first is that taking</font>

107
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:28,149
<font color="#CCCCCC">advantage of whatever you offer somehow</font>

108
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:32,139
so this is maybe generic to all customer

109
00:07:28,149 --> 00:07:35,239
everybody so in top of it we may like to

110
00:07:32,139 --> 00:07:39,319
where the customer can build up some

111
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:42,109
security coding for say and add an

112
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:45,169
additional feature so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> an open</font>

113
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:47,360
source tool feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> free</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to put in a pull</font>

114
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:51,289
request or<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> than happy to</font>

115
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:54,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">majak and coming to him</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on choose a</font>

116
00:07:51,289 --> 00:07:56,539
question of what we actually cover this

117
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:59,839
has got nothing or specific to any

118
00:07:56,539 --> 00:08:03,019
application these are more related to

119
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:05,029
your AWS account so what we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

120
00:08:03,019 --> 00:08:09,199
these this particular automation sweet

121
00:08:05,029 --> 00:08:16,149
looks at your<font color="#CCCCCC"> i am service basically</font>

122
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:16,149
checking what your user policies are I

123
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:25,730
yes so you're his question was is it as

124
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:29,990
an infrastructure and<font color="#CCCCCC"> clout</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> level yes</font>

125
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:33,650
this thing is a very specific to your

126
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:36,230
account level or it does<font color="#CCCCCC"> not really</font>

127
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:38,809
matter what is your application

128
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:42,170
architecture behind it<font color="#E5E5E5"> you may be using</font>

129
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:44,420
or classic ec2 instances you may be

130
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:46,060
using some container service you might

131
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:50,089
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> going in for a service architecture</font>

132
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:54,109
however<font color="#E5E5E5"> it be so we're looking at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I am</font>

133
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:55,700
policies we're looking at a monitoring a

134
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:59,180
special monitoring and logging

135
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:02,270
especially around<font color="#E5E5E5"> clout rail and a</font>

136
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:06,260
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit at networking or basically</font>

137
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:09,500
checking for ssh and rdp not being<font color="#E5E5E5"> open</font>

138
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:12,200
to the public internet just a very high

139
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:14,540
level test and so what we're

140
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,840
particularly trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to highlight out of</font>

141
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:19,790
this is this particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> suite of course</font>

142
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,790
may very well not be applicable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

143
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:25,670
we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not here to advertise oh this</font>

144
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:28,459
project not at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oh what we're here to</font>

145
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:33,079
basically talk about is that as a

146
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:37,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">principle is you can try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and implement</font>

147
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:39,620
or a suite like this also what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we was</font>

148
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:42,950
successfully were able to do was we

149
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:46,960
presented the suite to our customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

150
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:52,340
they in turn of forwarded it to their

151
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:55,370
security approval team and in a matter

152
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:59,420
of minutes they they approved of the

153
00:09:55,370 --> 00:10:01,790
tools once in advance and at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> time of</font>

154
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:05,240
just before the final go life of the

155
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:07,400
project it was just<font color="#E5E5E5"> one report that had</font>

156
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:09,980
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> submitted the adherence to the</font>

157
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:13,910
test automation sweet and we could go

158
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:17,150
live immediately so it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically the</font>

159
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:19,810
concept of building CI and continuous

160
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:22,220
testing within your automation pipeline

161
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:26,900
that is the concept<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font>

162
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:30,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">to basically highlight so what we have</font>

163
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:42,149
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that this particular test fails</font>

164
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:46,170
and sorry and the test failing is that

165
00:10:42,149 --> 00:10:49,020
our DP is open to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

166
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:56,599
what I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually go ahead and do is</font>

167
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:59,520
a big<font color="#E5E5E5"> my fix my security group rules</font>

168
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:03,180
okay the security group rules have been

169
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:12,110
fixed<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'll just give it another</font>

170
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:12,109
trigger sorry for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> network latency</font>

171
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:38,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">here so in the meantime while our street</font>

172
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:40,920
runs I so when do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> run this we</font>

173
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:45,180
particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> proposed to run it on two</font>

174
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:47,610
scenarios<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh one is so ideally would be</font>

175
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:50,670
wanting to manage your infrastructure as

176
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:52,980
code so any changes to<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

177
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:56,579
infrastructure codebase you should

178
00:11:52,980 --> 00:12:01,199
ideally want to run this these are of

179
00:11:56,579 --> 00:12:04,680
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> not very these cannot really</font>

180
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:08,279
prevents breakages this is more of a

181
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:11,699
monitoring that is to report in the case

182
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:16,589
of anything broken so what you would

183
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:18,359
maybe want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is it most aw set</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font>

184
00:12:16,589 --> 00:12:21,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">two types come across is you have</font>

185
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:24,529
multiple accounts so you carry<font color="#CCCCCC"> out your</font>

186
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:27,420
changes on accounts say your dev account

187
00:12:24,529 --> 00:12:31,649
run this particular suite against that

188
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:33,449
the same says account and only if it

189
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:43,170
goes green do your changes propagate to

190
00:12:33,449 --> 00:12:47,758
<font color="#E5E5E5">be higher environment can it be a part</font>

191
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:49,709
of post migration checklist or not so

192
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:54,360
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> you please</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> elaborate what do you</font>

193
00:12:49,709 --> 00:12:57,680
mean by<font color="#E5E5E5"> migraine I am migrating my day</font>

194
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,870
or<font color="#CCCCCC"> QA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or whatever server to the AWS</font>

195
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:03,810
after migration to AWS can I run this

196
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:06,300
dash taste and Gator dashboard that

197
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:08,609
everything is perfectly migrated or not

198
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,439
ideally you should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> running this every</font>

199
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:13,529
you should be running<font color="#CCCCCC"> this continuously</font>

200
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:16,620
every time you make the smallest change

201
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:19,529
to your code which is bringing in which

202
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:21,689
is introducing a new machine or anything

203
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:24,149
changing your infrastructure with an AWS

204
00:13:21,689 --> 00:13:26,670
you would want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> run your automation</font>

205
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:30,029
sweet you want to continuously monitor

206
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:33,149
you do not want a large number of broken

207
00:13:30,029 --> 00:13:34,089
changes to be brought in late in the

208
00:13:33,149 --> 00:13:37,040
cycle

209
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:39,199
that would be one<font color="#E5E5E5"> step another place or</font>

210
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:43,790
another aspect<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you would want to</font>

211
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:48,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe run this in is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aa see periodically</font>

212
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:51,319
this is mainly to handle conformance to

213
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:55,119
governance policies like how frequently

214
00:13:51,319 --> 00:13:58,240
your passwords or should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be changed so</font>

215
00:13:55,119 --> 00:14:01,309
AWS personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> as rid of the</font>

216
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:03,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">documentation AWS generates a</font>

217
00:14:01,309 --> 00:14:05,839
credentials report once every four hours

218
00:14:03,459 --> 00:14:08,949
so it actually generates it on demand

219
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:12,410
but once generated its cash for

220
00:14:08,949 --> 00:14:15,649
approximately for us and yeah so that's

221
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:20,779
the frequency as well that we recommend

222
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:23,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">you should run this at anything faster</font>

223
00:14:20,779 --> 00:14:28,189
than anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> more rapid than that it at</font>

224
00:14:23,749 --> 00:14:32,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">least the the credentials</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bit it would</font>

225
00:14:28,189 --> 00:14:45,679
not really be tested<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

226
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:50,290
surprisingly failed guys please feel

227
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:50,290
free<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask me any questions surround it</font>

228
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:22,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay I think I yep we saw a bug as well</font>

229
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:25,640
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> suite you recommending this as</font>

230
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:27,469
part of the CI deployment right yes so

231
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,180
since it was given the frequency is

232
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:32,510
going to be running at what's the

233
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,589
overhead so go ahead i mean sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

234
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:35,510
performance overhead is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm</font>

235
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:38,630
referring to so this thing is not

236
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:42,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">wearing your infrastructure at all so as</font>

237
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:47,480
part of your fleet of CIA agents or

238
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:48,649
nodes this is one other test suite that

239
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:52,310
would be running and it would be

240
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:56,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">querying AWS not your infrastructure it</font>

241
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:59,268
would be wearing AWS<font color="#E5E5E5"> API and the</font>

242
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:01,519
execution time this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> runs in 30</font>

243
00:15:59,269 --> 00:16:08,380
seconds that's what i<font color="#E5E5E5"> was getting it</font>

244
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:11,660
hang it so yeah I there has been a

245
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:25,550
runtime exception I think it's all so

246
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:27,680
yeah this is a bottle is some a few<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

247
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:30,649
the permanent customer of a SS cloud

248
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:33,410
will you get this book by automatic or a

249
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:36,440
litter separately<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to buy in</font>

250
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:41,029
this is a suite which we have written in

251
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:44,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">Python are using the Python SDK called</font>

252
00:16:41,029 --> 00:16:47,000
photo and we've written it completely a

253
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:49,550
by ourselves it's nothing which AWS

254
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,270
explicitly offers<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's best</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

255
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:56,779
wrote which we felt a need to be

256
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:59,209
continuously monitored it's got nuts

257
00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:04,520
it's not a product it's just standard

258
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:07,188
API is exposed using a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Python svk so is</font>

259
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:09,020
it doing the static analysis or dynamic

260
00:17:07,189 --> 00:17:12,439
analysis on the uws this is dynamic

261
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:16,089
analysis or<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this will actually test</font>

262
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:20,260
what you have already broken rather than

263
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:23,839
prevent any kind of breakages it is

264
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:24,260
corrective action I I know there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

265
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,940
sir

266
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:31,100
point where things might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> broken in in</font>

267
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:33,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">in your reader or from a security</font>

268
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:36,110
standpoint you have for example I had

269
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:39,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">our DP open and my guest suite hadn't</font>

270
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:41,360
run this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is just a demo see I it doesn't</font>

271
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:46,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">really wire into our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> completed or</font>

272
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:49,370
infrastructure<font color="#E5E5E5"> code base but yeah I mean</font>

273
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:54,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">you this ring is the thing is a reactive</font>

274
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:56,899
approach 0 1 way to leverage this is so

275
00:17:54,110 --> 00:18:00,620
certain recommendations also<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font>

276
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:03,350
leveraging<font color="#CCCCCC"> cloud watching and J and</font>

277
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:06,560
having cloud watch alarms to take a more

278
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:10,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">proactive approach those are also test</font>

279
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:13,010
which we have written to ensure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

280
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:18,290
least your alarms are present in case

281
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:22,129
your alarms itself are missing then you

282
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:25,430
may not<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the real feedback survey</font>

283
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:27,410
question any advantage of your tool over

284
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:30,440
security monkey because we already

285
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:34,220
pointed out right Goodman<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> already has</font>

286
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:37,660
a very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> wide coverage absolutely a</font>

287
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:43,280
security monkey is extremely exhausted

288
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:47,000
the quick win that I personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> saw in</font>

289
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:49,280
building this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a we did not need any</font>

290
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:54,050

<font color="#CCCCCC">is just running of a one additional it</font>

293
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:01,550
CIA agents so you're not really

<font color="#E5E5E5">investing in infrastructure the</font>

295
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:06,830
execution time is low and for a

continuously monitoring for<font color="#E5E5E5"> perspective</font>

297
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:13,879
I think leveraging the cloud service

298
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:17,210
providers native monitoring or tools in

299
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:19,850
this case cloud watch or personally

300
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:22,730
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be my choice because of the</font>

301
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:24,879
support they would come up with a sooner

for their release products<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">in case of infrastructure creation you</font>

304
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:35,929
may use tools like ansible Yumi's used

305
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:37,070
to choose like chef etc but the support

come up after a few months<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh I have one</font>

familiar with AWS config this thing so

317
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:11,880
our inspiration for this was the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CIS</font>

00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,669
recommendation document that says that's

00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:17,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">what our starting point was so if you</font>

320
00:20:14,670 --> 00:20:21,510
actually read the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> title</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of our track</font>

321
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:26,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">previously was a security in the cloud</font>

322
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:28,650
with CIS and AWS and we've now changed

323
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:32,640
it to AWS cloud since we have expanded

324
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:35,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">our source of recommendations AWS config</font>

what would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the corrective action you</font>

347
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:36,840
would basic maybe send out a

notification email pretty much similar

349
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:42,689
you you can just send out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a notification</font>

00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:51,130
do you have this in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the offer just yet</font>

353
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:54,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">the seller is it container available for</font>

354
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:57,370
it we have not<font color="#E5E5E5"> moved it to containers</font>

355
00:21:54,100 --> 00:22:00,840
yet also right now it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> executed</font>

356
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:04,350
as a script so i will just actually are

357
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:04,350
even run it

358
00:22:15,049 --> 00:22:20,840
the right now existence is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the plane</font>

359
00:22:17,029 --> 00:22:25,840
python script we are looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to next</font>

360
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:30,860
publish it as a Python module 2 by 5 so

361
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:32,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">our containers sure it's possible it's</font>

362
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:37,479
not something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're looking at</font>

363
00:22:32,779 --> 00:22:41,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">immediately to because at times</font>

364
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:45,799
containers at least in my opinion to<font color="#CCCCCC"> run</font>

365
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:49,100
just one script going in for containers

366
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:52,519
might be an overkill it is something

367
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:55,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">which is pretty tiny actually pison was</font>

368
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:58,789
a choice<font color="#E5E5E5"> or because of that reason a</font>

369
00:22:55,460 --> 00:23:01,639
python<font color="#CCCCCC"> is available in all linux</font>

370
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:04,429
distributions natively so all you

371
00:23:01,639 --> 00:23:07,729
explicitly need is the boat a library of

372
00:23:04,429 --> 00:23:10,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">Python okay so when you're running this</font>

373
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:13,399
restaurant you know one of these devices

374
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:15,350
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> edibles instances the honey of the</font>

00:23:13,399 --> 00:23:16,729
traffic leaves the outside that network

376
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:21,259
does it interact with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

377
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:23,179
traffic so he does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you you just</font>

378
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:25,129
mention that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rdp board was open on</font>

379
00:23:23,179 --> 00:23:27,080
the over the internet right yes so how

380
00:23:25,129 --> 00:23:30,769
did you check<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so this was actually</font>

381
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:34,970
an API call to the a to AWS ec2 client

382
00:23:30,769 --> 00:23:37,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and we actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> man iterated</font>

383
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:42,200
through all the security group rules and

384
00:23:37,489 --> 00:23:46,639
actually checked if<font color="#E5E5E5"> are so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VR dpu is</font>

385
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:50,210
port 3389 open a TCP port 3389 is that

386
00:23:46,639 --> 00:23:52,748
open or is all tcp traffic open or is

387
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:55,220
all traffic open so these are the three

388
00:23:52,749 --> 00:23:57,440
possible ways that you could have had

389
00:23:55,220 --> 00:24:00,230
the RDP port open so you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

390
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,309
policy-based check right sorry<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

391
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,869
these are the only tricks you're doing

392
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:05,178
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok concern whether the traffic is</font>

393
00:24:02,869 --> 00:24:06,709
interacting you whether the tool is

394
00:24:05,179 --> 00:24:09,649
interactive with like everything with

395
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:11,509
external public IP I thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

396
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:14,479
sort is happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> no so the security</font>

397
00:24:11,509 --> 00:24:17,570
group rules or<font color="#CCCCCC"> you specifically specify</font>

398
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:20,330
which are the icy white allowed ICS

399
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:21,799
right so we're just navigating through

400
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:23,869
or we're just iterating through the

401
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:25,730
security group rules and checking if any

402
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:26,830
of the security group rules have 3389

403
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:31,430
open toes

404
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:33,470
thank you any large deployment like ours

405
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:37,730
right has extremely complicated security

406
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:40,280
group rules right and so good good this

407
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:44,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">framework we extended to you know has</font>

408
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:46,430
recipes that you get my favorite we

409
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:48,800
wanted to how do we handle and extend

410
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:54,200
this for using complicated and very

411
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:57,919
customized security rules so how we had

412
00:24:54,200 --> 00:25:00,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually a designer all set up for</font>

413
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:03,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">especially security group rules so I'm</font>

414
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:06,970
coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a pretty similar scale of an</font>

415
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:10,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">application or we had four environments</font>

416
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:15,290
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually split the four environments</font>

417
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:17,720
into four different VDCs and so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a</font>

418
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:22,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">one-to-one mapping and we would make</font>

changes only<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the dev rules and it</font>

420
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:28,610
would just replicate a further so all

421
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:31,330
references were from security group

422
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:35,889
istikhara group all<font color="#E5E5E5"> references were</font>

423
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:38,300
parameterised and we could ensure

00:25:35,890 --> 00:25:40,190
parameterizing template<font color="#CCCCCC"> ice and we could</font>

425
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:43,790
ensure that all our security<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups or</font>

426
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:45,800

legacy network infrastructures what are

438
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:20,750
the best best practices you would

00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:22,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend and what kind of and DevOps</font>

441
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:31,750
affected so wrong so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the first</font>

442
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:34,460
half of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question the question is of</font>

443
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:35,480
people who have used to legacy

444
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:38,000
infrastructure

445
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:42,640
how does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that network security and a</font>

446
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:45,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">DevOps pod maps to when you go to AWS so</font>

447
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:48,320
what I have seen the biggest mistake

448
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:53,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">what people do is the lift and shift</font>

449
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:56,030
they think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the DC that the cloud is</font>

450
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:58,250
no different than the DC is they would

451
00:26:56,030 --> 00:27:01,460
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to implement the same firewall</font>

452
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:06,010
rules which they would have in the data

453
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:08,960
center or this is something where I

454
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:11,690
think many people make a mistake<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

455
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,750
need to identify they need to understand

456
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:16,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">that even when they are interacting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

457
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:19,430
the public cloud there they're

458
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:22,460
interacting over the public<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet so</font>

459
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:25,280
you have to ensure more security

460
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:30,200
policies around your complete

461
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:33,800
infrastructure and from automation

462
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:37,370
perspective well I think Jules is of

463
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:39,860
course it's a very personal choice but

464
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:43,000
infrastructure automation I think

465
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:47,780
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> or when you're scaling I</font>

466
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:50,390
think it's also much mandatory and it

467
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:52,720
allows you since you since you would use

468
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:56,240
some sort of version control behind it

469
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:59,030
it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow you to actually roll back</font>

470
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,880
very easily in case of a Miss

471
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:04,250
configuration and yeah it's it's

472
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:08,870
something which we have to try<font color="#CCCCCC"> it we've</font>

473
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:11,870
experienced or snowflake servers and it

474
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:15,139
was a mess because we did not have our

475
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:18,040
infrastructure automation in place once

476
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:23,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">you had the actual automation running</font>

477
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:27,530
configuration changes were fast and more

478
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:31,010
reliable all right so guys I'm gonna

479
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:33,020
open<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to the forum everyone anyone</font>

481
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:37,820
you guys are seen we just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

482
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:41,020
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it we have 15 minutes anything</font>

483
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:41,020
anything they just want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add</font>

484
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,150
we are very frequent but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike very</font>

485
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:52,000
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the were of them and frequently</font>

486
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:56,510

not only<font color="#E5E5E5"> he speaks about the network</font>

security portion about<font color="#E5E5E5"> by public clouds</font>

489
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:08,960
we also faced depending upon the

location of data center in across<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

491
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,750
world you need to additionally comply

492
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:17,149
with the data privacy act like if it is

493
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:19,370
if they explicitly tells you that if it

494
00:29:17,150 --> 00:29:21,140
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Singapore it may be Singapore this</font>

495
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:23,570
data protection act or if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in</font>

498
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:32,990
because India does not have expresses

499
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:35,720
the basic rule acted acted upon in

500
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:38,600
cities are now<font color="#E5E5E5"> five line so that is the</font>

501
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:41,420
additional thing we do require from them

502
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:44,060
and also encryption portion but<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:50,720
migration or any infrastructure build up

505
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:53,720
we follow basic hardening checklist<font color="#CCCCCC"> list</font>

506

and latter on has a<font color="#CCCCCC"> view passing</font>

whether he knew whatever the platform

are so especially from the hardening

checklist there are actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font>

couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> open source projects which</font>

highlights which which actually

implement it for you so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I remember</font>

519
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:35,660
correctly the name of the contributor is

00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:50,780
do is execution<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the complete ansible</font>

00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:05,950
connected under the load balancer until

530
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:11,130
then it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a it's just an isolated</font>

anybody else having just feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> free to</font>

533
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:21,460
here so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could just talk about a based</font>

534
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:24,820
on what what our biggest challenge is

535
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:26,770
seen when we move to specially when you

536
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:28,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">move</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to cloud right here not you don't</font>

537
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:31,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">want humans involved right you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> auto</font>

538
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:32,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">scaling</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be there you want to have</font>

539
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:34,960
templates and recipes and things comes

540
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:38,080
up and the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge when you</font>

541
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:40,510
have that is is you would need services

542
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,428
to talk in authenticate it means all of

543
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:45,070
them have to magically have some kind of

544
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:47,049
a secret right so the following<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

545
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:50,020
bootstrapping part and<font color="#E5E5E5"> where so if you</font>

546
00:31:47,049 --> 00:31:52,570
if you level go with so if any threat

547
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:54,400
modeling you do right the very first

548
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:56,470
thing you know if you have a key where

549
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:59,710
is this key come from and where this

550
00:31:56,470 --> 00:32:02,830
eventually he goes through so if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we are</font>

551
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:04,450
doing it and and there are like a solid

552
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:06,250
talked about I am roles in<font color="#E5E5E5"> journals and</font>

553
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:08,290
they help so a limit but it doesn't work

554
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:10,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">with if you have your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own services</font>

555
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:13,720
talking between themselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> you could if</font>

556
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:15,700
any platform provided system you have

557
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:19,540
works well we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> with us</font>

558
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:21,580
platform services right but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font>

559
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:24,520
riding on<font color="#E5E5E5"> one services just make sure</font>

560
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:26,379
that so then your configuration files

561
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:27,639
your chef and your false tax files

562
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:29,799
becomes a single point<font color="#E5E5E5"> of failure</font>

563
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:31,809
because you have things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the</font>

564
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:33,910
audience credentials your service auth

565
00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:36,940
tokens right even if you are doing

566
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:39,370
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> again pls your certificates</font>

567
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,570
are kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all born into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that so if</font>

568
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:42,459
ever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing that kind of a</font>

569
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:44,320
migration right because you want these

570
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">things to automatically common able to</font>

571
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:49,149
talk and but you would still<font color="#E5E5E5"> want it</font>

572
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,970
capability to be able to go and rotate

573
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:54,940
those scenes I have auditability and

574
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:58,390
visibility like couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of really not one</font>

575
00:32:54,940 --> 00:33:00,100
day like a bunch of really good

576
00:32:58,390 --> 00:33:02,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">open-source schools out there look look</font>

577
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:07,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">at key waves look at</font>

578
00:33:02,709 --> 00:33:09,259
confident look at you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know cook</font>

579

00:33:09,259 --> 00:33:13,969
KMS vault is something that comes into

584
00:33:18,409 --> 00:33:24,979
as a storage in that case so just seeing

585
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:26,959
this especially people making these

586
00:33:24,979 --> 00:33:31,070
mistakes and because if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

compliance mandate this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> something</font>

588
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:34,428
which is very fairly over dope that if<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">compromise even a single easy to</font>

instance and because<font color="#CCCCCC"> people would just</font>

591
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,799
typically have a same ones that one

<font color="#E5E5E5">thing that they will push out for all</font>

593
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:43,070
the services because they don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

594
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:44,599
have that<font color="#CCCCCC"> segmentation it would</font>

595
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:46,849
typically end up having all the cheese

596
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:50,539
of to talk to almost everything out

597
00:33:46,849 --> 00:33:52,369
there so that's just one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my key</font>

599
00:33:52,369 --> 00:33:55,939
then there is a very first thing just

600
00:33:53,539 --> 00:34:00,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure it out how you're handling</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">sure whether I got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you when you mean by</font>

607
00:34:17,629 --> 00:34:22,719
allocation and whenever we do some

608
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:24,949
relevant changes in infrastructure

609
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:27,558
whatever the hosted application

610
00:34:24,949 --> 00:34:32,538
sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is too little bitter quick</font>

611
00:34:27,559 --> 00:34:36,169
to to accommodate to that particular

612
00:34:32,539 --> 00:34:40,069
platform and infrastructure so there is

613
00:34:36,168 --> 00:34:42,710
there any specific application level the

614
00:34:40,069 --> 00:34:45,770
dependencies are there or if there are

615
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:47,240
application level dependencies I mean so

616
00:34:45,770 --> 00:34:51,020
if your application depends on what kind

617
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:53,629
of infrastructure is running on I think

618
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:57,619
the needs to be a second look at the

619
00:34:53,629 --> 00:35:00,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">application itself because yeah it</font>

620
00:34:57,619 --> 00:35:04,450
depends<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the u.s. sure but where is it</font>

621
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:07,460
physically running if it that depends

622
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:11,259
well then yeah the application has some

623
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:11,260
design issues in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> opinion</font>

624
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:18,130
last two<font color="#CCCCCC"> minutes do you want to talk</font>

625
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:21,370
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outage which you face me</font>

626
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:24,280
laughs with me and with it which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

627
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:29,950
aberration or is it something you will

628
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:33,820
work upon to avoid in future actually I

629
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:39,129
do not have any comments around it yeah

630
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:43,690
it it was I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think a static code analysis</font>

631
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:45,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">or would have helped but yeah that's all</font>

632
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:48,340
that I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> think of what could have</font>

prevented are at this moment until you

00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:55,860
do a root cause<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure thank you</font>
