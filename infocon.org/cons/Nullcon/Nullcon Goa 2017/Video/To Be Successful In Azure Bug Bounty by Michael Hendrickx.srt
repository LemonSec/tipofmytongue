about a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few things we're going to talk</font>

27
00:01:02,469 --> 00:01:06,670
about attack surface of a sure what a

jury's exactly we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about</font>

29
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">the background of the bug bounty program</font>

30
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,720
that we have we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about</font>

31
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:16,420
fast payouts which you had four bucks<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

32
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:18,400
scope which of which<font color="#E5E5E5"> type of ducks are</font>

00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,350
within the scope of which or not and

34
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,909
then we'll explain you a little bit how

35
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:27,699
to get started and how to get cracking

36
00:01:21,909 --> 00:01:30,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">on this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bug bounty program so the azure</font>

37
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:35,259
attack surface with the show of hands

38
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:36,700
who doesn't know what a jury's good one

39
00:01:35,259 --> 00:01:41,530
person our marketing team is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that</font>

40
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:43,210
bad in the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> adger is the Microsoft</font>

41
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:45,970
cloud right and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a copy of</font>

42
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:47,048
anyone else of course it's it's a little

43
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:49,539
bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than that it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just the</font>

44
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:51,850
website to spin up VMs and if you see

45
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:54,280
from an attack surface it's relatively

46
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,270
complicated when I joined Microsoft and

47
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,619
I'm still struggling with all the

48
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,750
aggravation there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

49
00:01:56,619 --> 00:02:01,450
interactions with it so in the center

50
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:03,219
you have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft Azure on the</font>

51
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:05,350
left<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see different ways you can</font>

52
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:07,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">interact with it there's a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerShell</font>

53
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:09,008
window over there<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's visual studio</font>

54
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:10,690
there's two different portals to talk to

55
00:02:09,008 --> 00:02:12,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">ezer and under on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right you can see</font>

56
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:13,870
talks to data centers and all these

57
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:15,769
things as well but there's a lot more to

58
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:17,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">it for example we have</font>

59
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:20,060
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> read</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> somewhere</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> along the way as well</font>

60
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,609
office 365 uses file storage blobstore

61
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,580
stable storage which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all hosted on on</font>

62
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:28,730
agile after that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have things like</font>

63
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:31,460
federated identity fear of your your

64
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,170
Active Directory on-premises in your own

65
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,330
data center you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> sync it with the</font>

66
00:02:33,170 --> 00:02:37,339
realtor and don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> worry I'm not going to</font>

67
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:40,370
explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it does appreciate</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it it is</font>

68
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:42,320
a marketing talk if things such as

69
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:43,970
virtual networks you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> extend your own</font>

70
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,709
network to the cloud you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

71
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:48,040
like multiple tenants in there obviously

72
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:50,900
we don't just have one customer luckily

73
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,880
your things where you can deploy

74
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:54,680
applications any applications you can

75
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,870
deploy<font color="#E5E5E5"> your web applications mobile</font>

76
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:59,210
applications but also worker roles which

77
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:01,910
are sort of a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit like like cron</font>

78
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:05,360
jobs in<font color="#E5E5E5"> UNIX and the list keeps on going</font>

79
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:07,340
we can obviously spin up VMs in the in

80
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,410
Azure we have something called<font color="#CCCCCC"> the vm</font>

81
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,970
marketplace so it's not just linux boxes

82
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:14,180
and windows boxes you can actually

83
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:15,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">download web application firewall images</font>

84
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,470
and run them in the clouds as a

85
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,600
virtualized image so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> list goes on</font>

86
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,760
and on we have on frame applications

87
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:26,600
that you can publish in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> clouds you</font>

88
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:28,489
have SQL databases obviously one of our

89
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,709
flagship product we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have no SQL</font>

90
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:32,570
databases we are catching such as ready

91
00:03:30,709 --> 00:03:35,870
sketches and so on you have user

92
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:37,370
management and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the list goes on and on I</font>

93
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,890
don't know which<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kinnser ok now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

94
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:43,130
have extra gateways to to connect your

95
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:44,630
data center to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud and so on you</font>

96
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,190
have load balancing in the area of

97
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:49,160
network security<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups which are sort</font>

98
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:51,230
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> lexus like virtual firewalls there</font>

99
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,030
are you sell services in case somebody

100
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,100
forgets their password or their account

101
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,990
is locked out then<font color="#E5E5E5"> then they won't be</font>

102
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,940
calling you at<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3m if you're on if your</font>

104
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:04,490
noticed factor authentication obviously

105
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,380
we have scales<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's whereby with normal</font>

106
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:08,090
scripts very rich in<font color="#CCCCCC"> PowerShell or in</font>

107
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:12,220
Python or anything you can manage up to

108
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:16,340
tens or thousands of VMs all at once

109
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:17,660
load balancing is there extra there's

110
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,969
backup obviously if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to send</font>

00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:23,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">data to the cloud we have a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> CD and you</font>

115
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,389

118
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,370
networking<font color="#E5E5E5"> adjure it's pretty much what</font>

119
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,080
is the what is this thing all about it

120
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:38,330
talks the storage we took the<font color="#CCCCCC"> database</font>

121
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">it talks to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's not</font>

122
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">just because a sure is complex from an</font>

123
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,250
attack this point of view from an

124
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,380
offensive security point of view it

125
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:48,590
means there's a relatively big attack

126
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,300
surface as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have either as a</font>

127
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:52,219
very abstract<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing you have a few</font>

128
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,289
portals talk into it a few scripts it

129
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,810
talks<font color="#CCCCCC"> to hundreds of other things it's</font>

130
00:04:54,289 --> 00:05:00,289
very complex which makes it interesting

131
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:02,840
to to attack so what we noticed when you

132
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:06,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">have such a complete complex beast in</font>

133
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:08,599
fact it would be a handy thing to make

134
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:11,120
that subject to a to a bug bounty so in

135
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:12,830
April 2015 we started this bug bounty

136
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,599
program to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> included with the other</font>

ones<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have to give our customers</font>

138
00:05:14,599 --> 00:05:19,370
as well as the research community a way

139
00:05:17,389 --> 00:05:21,710
to find vulnerabilities in a way to

140
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:23,120
reach out to us we've expanded the

141
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:27,440
bounty ever since if you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little</font>

later we opened<font color="#CCCCCC"> it up to office 365 as</font>

well and half<font color="#E5E5E5"> a year later after that we</font>

also open it up to azure as if either is

153
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,969
a very complex thing it only made sense

180
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:05,300
second ago you said the maximum payout

181
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,980
is fifteen thousand dollars and a tub

182
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,020
duck we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually paid twenty four</font>

183
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:11,720
thousand dollars for it this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

184
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,729
during a double bounty program the

185
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,130
researcher found a bug we awarded twelve

186
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:18,349
thousand dollars times dude its basic

187
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:20,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">maps every we gave the person twenty</font>

188
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:22,070
four thousand dollars on top of that

189
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,350
that person joined<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft is also a</font>

190
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:26,120
signing bonus plus the above the bug

191
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:29,419
bounty with a pretty good months for him

192
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think if you look at this if you look</font>

193
00:07:29,419 --> 00:07:32,330
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the general trend of this as well</font>

194
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:34,849
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> much you can see a lot of</font>

195
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:36,979
things coming back right or dub bug it's

196
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:39,139
an authentication by that the other one

197
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:41,180
is an authentication bypass as well and

198
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:48,500
then there's impersonation again about

199
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:51,770
identity wrld<font color="#E5E5E5"> em wrl decoding is against</font>

200
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,720
the steel authentication token so if you

201
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,729
have to if you have to get anything from

202
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,970
this slide is that we pay quite a bit

203
00:07:55,729 --> 00:08:00,860
for for authentication<font color="#E5E5E5"> bugs identity and</font>

204
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:02,660
authentication is very important over us

205
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,640
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a little bit more in</font>

206
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:08,150
depth about them three on these slides

207
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:10,520
the azure virtual network gateway bypass

208
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:13,130
and two of the web<font color="#E5E5E5"> box and a little bit</font>

209
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:15,590
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Lauer of lower payout so you can</font>

210
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:19,159
see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of amount of money we pay</font>

211
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:22,609
for for<font color="#E5E5E5"> what type of books so number one</font>

212
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:25,580
the azure virtual network<font color="#E5E5E5"> gateway</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bypass</font>

213
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,530
in a sure we call it to Zenith what is

214
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:30,560
Enid actually this virtual network is

215
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:32,809
your network logically in the clouds you

216
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,669
can set up any private IP addressing

217
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:36,319
with your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS servers if you want in</font>

218
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:38,208
the cloud and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> great thing and this</font>

219
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,529
is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a marketing spiel the great thing</font>

220
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:41,239
is you can have several networks with

221
00:08:39,529 --> 00:08:42,469
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same subnet so you can test your</font>

222
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,690
applications in a test environment

223
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:47,780
production environment without changing

224
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:50,300
any any IP addresses now how<font color="#E5E5E5"> that how</font>

225
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:51,529
you can connect to it I mean this runs

226
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,329
in the cloud how you can come

227
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:56,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">how you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> extend this to your own</font>

230
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:02,389
virtual network gateway it's using

231
00:09:00,889 --> 00:09:05,779
something called a secure socket

232
00:09:02,389 --> 00:09:08,540
tunneling protocol or at the CP now how

233
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:11,779
ssdp works initially you set up a TLS

234
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:13,519
tunnel or 443 which is HTTPS so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it'll</font>

235
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:16,040
break out it will break through most

236
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:19,279
firewalls once<font color="#E5E5E5"> that tunnel is set up you</font>

237
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually do some SSCP state control</font>

238
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:23,569
packets and with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can you get</font>

239
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:26,990
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the network so somewhere</font>

240
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:28,969
something went wrong and by by sending a

241
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:31,850
special crafted sequence of<font color="#CCCCCC"> packets you</font>

242
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:33,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">could skip</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the authentication step which</font>

243
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,749
in plain English will actually means it

244
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:39,290
would give access to a virtual network

245
00:09:35,749 --> 00:09:41,689
without any any credentials at all which

246
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:45,709
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty bad that's why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we paid 3,000</font>

247
00:09:41,689 --> 00:09:49,939
of 13,000 and a bit dollars for<font color="#CCCCCC"> finding</font>

engineering network packet back and

250
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:55,189
forward you run a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of Wireshark and</font>

251
00:09:53,809 --> 00:09:58,939
other things just to see what's

00:09:55,189 --> 00:10:03,519
happening another box of where you can

253
00:09:58,939 --> 00:10:05,599
leak tokens is is basically in all up

254

when you try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> log into a certain</font>

00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:13,009
as you're authorized a certain

application it'll send you back to an to

259
00:10:13,009 --> 00:10:18,079
certain to certain URL that you specify

260
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:19,540
this URL obviously cannot be anything it

261
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:23,420
needs to be limited and so on and

262
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:26,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">decides in our case Microsoft make sure</font>

263
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:28,519
that this URL is what what we expect it

264
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:30,110
to be somewhere something<font color="#E5E5E5"> went wrong and</font>

265
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:32,449
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> weren't doing double encoding which</font>

266
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:35,240
meant that somebody could could give a

267
00:10:32,449 --> 00:10:36,889
URL which was doubly encoded now in<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs</font>

268
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,740
you can put a percentage sign in the hex

269
00:10:36,889 --> 00:10:41,389
value so percentage to F which you can

270
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:44,300
give you later which you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

271
00:10:41,389 --> 00:10:46,670
there just becomes a forward slash and

272
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:49,490
percentage 25 actually become too

273
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:52,040
becomes the percentage sign itself the

274
00:10:49,490 --> 00:10:53,929
checking did more than one decoding the

275
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,849
value we give back didn't so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem</font>

276
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:58,490
is you could actually have this as a

277
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:00,199
valid domain giving back to us now<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font>

who ever<font color="#CCCCCC"> try basic authentication on</font>

everything if you type in your browser

it<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually went to evil domain dog net</font>

291

which is something that that a hacker

292
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:31,140
would own for example and add<font color="#E5E5E5"> darker</font>

custard<font color="#E5E5E5"> as thirteen thousand dollars</font>

294
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:37,500
because we did you could steal access

296
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:43,110
a little bit more in the land of all up

297
00:11:40,010 --> 00:11:44,970
everyone has seen these<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">everyone has run through some sort of</font>

all up authentication authorization

you have a yes any website or mobile

306
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:05,010
they do allow this application to give

your magic happening in the back and it

00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:15,359
will go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the website</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to your</font>

instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> showing an alert button</font>

obviously or instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stealing cookies</font>

325
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:47,070
you would just fake a click so you could

00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:49,350
have somebody authorize your application

authorized it damaged twelve thousand

dollars for this for this bug for

339
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,080
cross-site scripting now if you stick to

340
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:19,300
cross that

341
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,350
thing don't take this as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> vfa twelve</font>

thousand dollars for cross-site

343
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,730
scripting a few months ago there was a

blind stored cross-site scripting result

345
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:29,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">I would pay a little bit less for this</font>

346
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:31,420
it's a bit of get rich if you if you

347
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:33,459
translate it down it basically it's a

348
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:35,979
ping back to a certain domain those who

349

354
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:19,700
and we're back sorry the thing Microsoft

355
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:22,709
Adam axis the microphone wanted me to us

356
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:28,320
to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop working I'm sure we</font>

00:14:22,709 --> 00:14:29,640
can edit<font color="#E5E5E5"> a video right ok so anyway with</font>

358
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,529
this yet across site scripting

359
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,420
vulnerability store the<font color="#CCCCCC"> assorted</font>

360
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:36,209
scripting vulnerability as well in one

361
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:38,130
of the azure domains basically an

362
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:40,920
attacker could give a certain input

363
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:44,399
which is sort of over here and it could

364
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,899
only be read by<font color="#E5E5E5"> back-end engineers the</font>

365
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,640
problem is it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very difficult to find</font>

366
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:50,370
out if a<font color="#E5E5E5"> backend engineer actually click</font>

367
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:52,980
on this unless with some sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of call</font>

368
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:56,670
back to a custom to a custom domain this

00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:57,930
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> works two thousand dollars and in</font>

370
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,839
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is very difficult to</font>

00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">exploit the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> backend URLs are only</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Network brilliant it's a valid valid</font>

374
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,420
bounty then the more of the lower

375
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:16,380
payouts<font color="#CCCCCC"> microsoft obviously has a lot of</font>

376
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:18,300
websites a lot of website and we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

377
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,760
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this internal drive to</font>

378
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">make every site we have HTTPS and every</font>

379
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,959
link on our website should be encrypted

380
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:29,959
as well should be HTTP ssl some of her

381
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:32,520
if if one of our pages has an HTTP

382
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:35,189
hyperlink hard-coded in there then we

383
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:36,779
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> the problem is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> someone who</font>

384
00:15:35,190 --> 00:15:39,060
does a man-in-the-middle could redirect

385
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:40,620
traffic so now this doesn't cover every

386
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,899
domain that if you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensitive</font>

387
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,970
domains such as account of microsoft com

388
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:46,709
which as the name tells you is something

389
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:50,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">about your account at the microsoft</font>

390
00:15:46,709 --> 00:15:52,260
domain this is eligible for a bounty as

391
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:54,560
well as that it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the lower</font>

392
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:57,510
payout so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a five-hundred-dollar</font>

393
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:59,219
five-hundred-dollar bucks again this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

394
00:15:57,510 --> 00:16:01,260
very subject to which domain it is so

395
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,089
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> start scanning all our domains and</font>

396
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:05,900
look for HTTP in there because that's

397
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:08,390
not gonna as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to fly so well</font>

398
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:09,860
so basically what things do we look for

399
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:11,480
right this is more<font color="#E5E5E5"> or less you're always</font>

400
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,970
stop then on the left here if you cross

401
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:15,530
site scripting in there<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're CSRF in</font>

402
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:17,090
there certain authentication

403
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:19,189
vulnerabilities and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so on and</font>

404
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:21,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">so on but the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> highest bounties are</font>

405
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:23,690
basically earned on authentication I

406
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:27,170
said it earlier and I'll say it again we

407
00:16:23,690 --> 00:16:29,480
have a multi-tenant environment if you

408
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:31,420
have if your<font color="#CCCCCC"> customer one you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> access</font>

409
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:34,490
customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that's a bad thing obviously</font>

410
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:37,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">so anything authentication I really</font>

411
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:38,980
related is it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty bad any something</font>

412
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:41,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">will say will pay quite well for</font>

413
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:43,460
privilege escalation and welage is sort

414
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:44,810
of from a vertical escalation point of

415
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:46,640
view we'll talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it in a second</font>

416
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:48,920
curse that scripting and cross-site

417
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,230
request forgery<font color="#E5E5E5"> Artem are most of the</font>

high fails as well in scope domains

420
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:59,720

report don't try to look for passwords

how strong the bug is but we also look

at how much is impacted does it affect

we usually<font color="#CCCCCC"> give em at the end credits</font>

software and we keep as your credits as

well because we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to encourage you to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">use the platform a lot more</font>

493
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:47,629
I'm quickly<font color="#E5E5E5"> well what I talked about</font>

494
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:49,908
<font color="#E5E5E5">earlier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so for example</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a</font>

496
00:19:49,909 --> 00:19:53,840
if you talk really about authentication

497
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:55,699
where you can go wrong you can have

498
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,889
horizontal abuse and vertical abuse

499
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:59,989
horizontal abuse and the name sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

500
00:19:57,889 --> 00:20:02,238
implies it is when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> use your a and</font>

application jumping into another or one

504
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,919
step higher if you can go from one

505
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:12,980
tenant and access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that in the other</font>

tenant vertical abuse as the name

507
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:17,779
implies is sort of the way<font color="#E5E5E5"> up here and</font>

508
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,489
it's a really poor choice of colors no

509
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:21,169
now I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see when it's presented you</font>

510
00:20:19,489 --> 00:20:23,480
have anonymous users at the bottom if

00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,789
privilege escalation of course the

514
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:30,590
higher you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go fabric</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> admin which there</font>

515
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:32,989
are our so that means<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can't reach</font>

516
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:36,259
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> level</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad so the</font>

517
00:20:32,989 --> 00:20:39,340
higher you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> the more impact your</font>

00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:41,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">bug has and the more the payout will be</font>

519
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:45,590
so how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> start all this how do we</font>

520
00:20:41,749 --> 00:20:47,659
get cracking right with to access a sure

521
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:49,699
there's a few ways that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do one</font>

522
00:20:47,659 --> 00:20:51,710
if you have an msdn or a visual studio

523
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:53,359
subscription you<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have a droid</font>

524
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:56,179
credits already we give<font color="#E5E5E5"> you one hundred</font>

525
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:59,389
fifty dollars of credits per month that

526
00:20:56,179 --> 00:21:00,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can use to run</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> VMs and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whatnot if</font>

527
00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:02,418
you sign up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a sure and then</font>

528
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:04,730
expansion slides will show you how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

529
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:06,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you can use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for free for one</font>

530
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,480
month gives you two<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred dollars</font>

531
00:21:06,889 --> 00:21:11,840
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> roughly the equivalent of</font>

532
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:14,210
running 13 or 14 vm or having 40 sequel

533
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:16,039
databases or having a terabyte storage

534
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:17,659
or something in the clouds and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

535
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:20,299
you'll run out of the two hundred

536
00:21:17,659 --> 00:21:21,980
dollars other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can do it</font>

537
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:24,830
instead of radius caches do machine

538
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:27,109
learning<font color="#CCCCCC"> IOC Azure Active Directory and</font>

539
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:30,789
all those buzzwords once you run out of

540
00:21:27,109 --> 00:21:34,129
money once the ones that month is over

541
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:35,960
they shouldn't stop testing in fact as

542
00:21:34,129 --> 00:21:37,939
long as you want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can keep on using</font>

543
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:39,649
Azure Active direction you can create as

544
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,960
many users that you want you can still

545
00:21:39,649 --> 00:21:44,359
deploy I think up to 15 web and mobile

546
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:46,220
applications you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> still do machine</font>

547
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:48,168
learning you can look you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do log</font>

548
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:50,239
analytics up to I think 500 megabytes

549
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:51,799
per day you can still set up your

550
00:21:50,239 --> 00:21:54,350
virtual networks and all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things all</font>

551
00:21:51,799 --> 00:21:55,480
for free<font color="#E5E5E5"> for as long as you for as long</font>

552
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:59,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font>

553
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:00,940
so how do we spin it up relatively

554
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:03,550
simple initially I was thinking of<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

555
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:07,030
it live for them with<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet you're</font>

556
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:10,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">not always sure basically if you go to a</font>

557
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:11,620
short microsoft com you end up on on our

558
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:14,889
page or if you google or use being

559
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:17,439
obviously for to go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> azure you'll end</font>

560
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:19,810
up on our on our page there's a big call

561
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,550
to action in the middle there you click

562
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:23,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">on start free and it'll get you to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

next<font color="#CCCCCC"> screen little bit of marketing</font>

564
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:26,830
thing basically say the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

565
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:30,189
said before there's two hundred dollars

566
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:31,720
of free credit you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> try any service</font>

567
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:34,300
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which isn't like the old</font>

00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,010
shareware from the from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 90s and that</font>

569
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,720
shows you how<font color="#E5E5E5"> old I am but in the 90s</font>

570
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:39,310
you would have this function limited

571
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:41,440

<font color="#E5E5E5">normal outlook.com account or hotmail</font>

583
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:09,790
account or a live account or if you have

584
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:12,430
any work or school organization which is

586
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:18,010
can use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> account as well so you</font>

587
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:19,600
basically look in plus outlook accounts

588
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,890
obviously or free yourself so<font color="#CCCCCC"> too young</font>

589
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:23,260
you need to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for anything like this</font>

590
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:25,980
as well you keep your basic information

591
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:28,830
your name there you are your phone

592
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:32,350
potentially which company you work for

593
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:34,360
you have to give your your phone number

594
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:37,780
and if you change countries for example

595
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:40,120
i live in canada if you see<font color="#E5E5E5"> 200 canadian</font>

596
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:43,210
dollars is not the same as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 200</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> US</font>

597
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:45,310
dollars so if you say you live in<font color="#E5E5E5"> canada</font>

598
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:47,740
it obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> it automatically changes to</font>

599
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:49,510
250 a canadian dollar so it's always<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

600
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,950
equivalent of two hundred US dollars it

601
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:52,180
gives you a phone number it sends you<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

602
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:54,100
SMS to make sure this phone number

603
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:57,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">really belongs to you sort of lacking</font>

604
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:58,270
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> an OTP thing you give the code next</font>

605
00:23:57,190 --> 00:24:00,010
thing and this is where a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

606
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:02,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">are taking a step back a little bit you</font>

607
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:03,460
have to give credit card information now

608
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,200
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to charge you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anything</font>

609
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:07,780
when we say it's free it's really free

610
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:08,590
it's just it so it's the reduced froth

611
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,570
is to make sure

612
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:12,520
that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a person that that</font>

614
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,770

615
00:24:14,169 --> 00:24:19,240
here you put your expiry date a normal

616
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:22,539
thing if you buy something<font color="#E5E5E5"> online and</font>

617
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,100
then after<font color="#CCCCCC"> that yeah as I said</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is it a</font>

618
00:24:22,539 --> 00:24:26,529
few times already your<font color="#CCCCCC"> cart</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> won't be</font>

619
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:28,149
won't be charged and in fact it's not

620
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:29,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">that when the monthly is over we</font>

621
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:31,480
suddenly start charging you without

622
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:33,279
telling you you actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

623
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,110
manually enable saying okay from now on

624
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,929
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start to start paying so</font>

625
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:41,740

626
00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:44,260
need to do so after that you're ready

627
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:45,760

628
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:47,379
agreement so you're going to read that

629
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,740
you're going to agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it and then</font>

630

632
00:24:52,059 --> 00:24:57,490
started to eat with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Azure basically how</font>

633
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:59,260

up your subscription after that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is done</font>

635

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">you click on that and this is the portal</font>

that all our customers use when they use

639
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,590
a sure as I said there's no test bet

640
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:13,600
there's no demo environment this is the

641
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:15,580
real deal from<font color="#E5E5E5"> here you can start using</font>

642
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:17,918
virtual machines you can create

648
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,520

00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:33,610
bottom it says view<font color="#CCCCCC"> my bills it's a few</font>

652
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:39,428
way that if you have more than one

653
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:41,350
subscription this is the free trial that

654
00:25:39,429 --> 00:25:43,090
you just set up you click on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

655
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:46,299
then finally you can see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

656
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:48,820
27 days left and a 250 credits remaining

657
00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:51,129
now why is this 27<font color="#E5E5E5"> days I made this</font>

658
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:53,710
slice the week ago because I wanted to

659
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:55,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure at the latest portal and so on</font>

660
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:58,539
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Dean wanted to show all screens</font>

661
00:25:55,059 --> 00:26:01,840
februari only has 28 days so now it's

662
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:03,140
marks you're happy it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> 31 days make the</font>

663
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,260
most out of it

664
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:08,450
so once this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> there just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see how</font>

665
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:12,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">much you have left and an epic weekend</font>

666
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:13,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">closes again in fact the portal we were</font>

667
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,070
on earlier there are two different

668
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:17,270
portals the one you saw earlier is the

669
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:20,270
new one we also have something called

670
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:21,710
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> old portal which looks like this is</font>

671
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:25,040
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit less appealing to the eye</font>

672
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:27,830
my opinion the good<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font>

673
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:29,570
well you can you can still get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to these</font>

674
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:30,919
to manage<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Windows Azure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> calm that</font>

675
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:32,870
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the previous domain we</font>

676
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:34,640
don't use it that much anymore the great

677
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:36,800
thing about it is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

678
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">covered in a bug bounty so you're sort</font>

679
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:41,810
of talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a codebase that's a few</font>

680
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:43,070
years<font color="#E5E5E5"> old that's not i'm not going to</font>

681
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:44,600
actively developed anymore because

682
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,860
that's wrong but but we're obviously

683
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,080
pushing a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the new</font>

684
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:49,370
portal but this is still part of the of

685
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,870
the bug bounty we're not going to say

686
00:26:49,370 --> 00:26:52,939
well no one uses these anymore so it's

687
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:55,879
not valid this is there so you can

688
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:59,330
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> assured from a web point of view</font>

689
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:01,310
to do through two<font color="#CCCCCC"> different ways let's</font>

690
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:04,220
move back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the new portal we can add</font>

691
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:05,899
users to our tenants you virtually

692
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:07,850
create an active directory in the cloud

693
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:09,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">you can add users to it and they can</font>

694
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:10,939
sign up you can enable notice extra

695
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:12,740
authentication so they could at the

696
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:15,710
message when they log on and so on and

697
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:17,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">so on aside from users you can also add</font>

698
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:19,220
enterprise applications to it web

699
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:23,090
applications mobile applications

700
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:25,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">wherever you want but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not just only</font>

701
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:27,970
to the portal in fact if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> use visual</font>

702
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:30,740
studio and you write any asp.net

703
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:32,870
application you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily push this to</font>

704
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:34,940
the to the clouds as well you right

705
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:37,610
click on your<font color="#E5E5E5"> project you click publish</font>

706
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:39,110
web app it ask you a few questions where

707
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:42,050
do you want to do it in your data center

708
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:43,969
or in Azure next thing it will actually

709
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:45,470
pick up the same subscription that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

710
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:47,870
have it knows who you are when you're

851
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,130
they should have the training

852
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:50,110
documentation so they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to</font>

853
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:51,580
find the resources to do that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

854
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:53,379
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the next Michael and I hear</font>

855
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:55,149
Swami's also here we also<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft for</font>

856
00:33:53,380 --> 00:34:06,370
the next three<font color="#CCCCCC"> days hit us up we're more</font>

857
00:33:55,150 --> 00:34:08,230
than happy to discuss this further can

858
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:09,819
you repeat<font color="#CCCCCC"> the question as well as</font>

859
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:13,960
recording how long does it take

860
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:16,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">Microsoft attach a bug it depends it</font>

861
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:18,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">genuinely depends some bugs it depends</font>

862
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the priority depends on the severity</font>

863
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:21,220
of the bug it depends<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the quality of</font>

864
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:23,320
report<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the researcher has submitted</font>

865
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:27,299
us and that's why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> always ask</font>

866
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,300
researchers to submit<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-quality bugs</font>

867
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:37,989
we try to I can't answer that it just

868
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:39,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">completely depends on the type of</font>

869
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:41,949
vulnerability each engineering group is

870
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:44,020
different each product is different we

871
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:45,699
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to patch the buggy as fast as</font>

872
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,770
possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ensure customers are secure</font>

873
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:50,049
and it's a holistic thing because when

874
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:51,820
we receive bugs it's not just go do one

875
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,960
particular fix and that's that we do

876
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,940
variant analysis for all the

877
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,300
vulnerabilities and Swami in his talk

878
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:58,160
tomorrow in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wind</font>

879
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,680
of mitigation we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how we</font>

use<font color="#CCCCCC"> all this information variant</font>

881
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:04,279
analysis work with different engineering

882
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,350
teams to do a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> holistic patch</font>

883
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:08,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">because we want to ensure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that no one</font>

884
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:11,029
can just bend if what patch you've taken

885
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:13,520
and then it basically becomes moot all

886
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:26,510
the work that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've done but in short it</font>

887
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:28,130
depends I'm sorry from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business</font>

888
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:30,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">perspective from the technical service</font>

889
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:32,990
catalog perspective we should have the

890
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:34,850
service definitions well defined in line

891
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:36,859
with the turnaround time for specific

892
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:39,020
vulnerability or<font color="#CCCCCC"> bug so we definitely</font>

893
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:40,700
are in line with industry standards<font color="#CCCCCC"> gbv</font>

894
00:35:39,020 --> 00:35:42,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">and a few other folks externally have</font>

895
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,089
set what the industry standards will

896
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:46,160
look like and we are in line<font color="#E5E5E5"> for all of</font>

897
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:47,720
those we make sure that as soon as we

898
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,819
get information for vulnerabilities it's

899
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">not like we sit on them we immediately</font>

900
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:53,600
take action and make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> the patches</font>

901

are released for<font color="#CCCCCC"> any customers in a</font>

902
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,170
holistic way as soon as possible oh

903
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:59,060
that's as earliest as early as possible

904
00:35:57,170 --> 00:36:01,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">I understand but do we have the define</font>

906
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:05,899

<font color="#CCCCCC">you additional information on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that but I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">won't be able to speak to that here all</font>

909
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:22,580
right just one<font color="#CCCCCC"> question in verse slide</font>

910
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:25,880
you have said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we should not</font>

911
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:28,009
disclosed p<font color="#CCCCCC"> or seen in public but</font>

912
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:31,790
recently as p.m. tonight at<font color="#CCCCCC"> google has</font>

913
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:34,760
disclosed windows hn<font color="#CCCCCC"> indian next or even</font>

914
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:39,740
if it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> exploit so any thought on that</font>

915
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:42,140
early<font color="#CCCCCC"> what Microsoft has been fun any</font>

916
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:46,180
stops on that my diplomatic start is it

917
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:46,180
intersects a sure sighs enough

918
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:53,120
yeah i think that's that's that's the

919
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:58,160
right answer yeah i'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> here to talk about</font>

920
00:36:53,120 --> 00:37:08,359
Asher one more hopefully an easier

921
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:11,450
question so my<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is related to</font>

922
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:13,010
SEO and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know that what are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

923
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:15,529
different service that<font color="#E5E5E5"> edge is providing</font>

924
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:18,140
for handling the incident response in

925
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:20,510
case somethin happens on our as your

926
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:22,640
infrastructure so how as a company we

927
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:24,050
should go for it to Miz look for what

928
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:29,299
are different instances or different

929
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:32,600
services we should look into it I don't

930
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:34,430
understand exactly what like ink in AWS

931
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,020
we had cloud trail and cloud watch on

932
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:37,549
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> blogs</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> where we can look into</font>

933
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,710
the words our different authenticated

934
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:43,010
means<font color="#E5E5E5"> different actions has been taken</font>

935
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:44,900
by the attacker but what means is

936
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:46,520
irrespective of track what are the

937
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:48,220
different shall we see that SEO is

938
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:53,210
providing for looking into

939
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:54,529
unauthenticated access I'm different

940
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:58,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">action or different services that</font>

941
00:37:54,530 --> 00:38:01,100
anything i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know exactly if you and</font>

942
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:02,660
I know this is a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad answer to give</font>

943
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:06,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">but if you go on the azure website to</font>

944
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:09,080
see all the security offers we do we do

945
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:10,940
detection for for scanning for passwords

946
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:13,240
password abused and all the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

947
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:16,280
well so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> those things built in</font>

948
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:18,080
the balance reckon<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can give you i'm on</font>

949
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:20,180
the offensive side so i don't know

950
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:22,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">exactly what as a result keeping to</font>

951
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:24,220
automatically presented<font color="#E5E5E5"> aquila looks</font>

952
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:26,720
angry at me and I'm sure she's gonna

953
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:28,490
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think what I would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> recommend is</font>

954
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,470
microsoft india team is here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

955
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:32,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">of them are the folks working with the</font>

956
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:34,549
customers<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they work and there's also</font>

957
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:36,050
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of folks on the marketing sites</font>

958
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:38,180
they inherently know a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

959
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:40,220
information that customers will use for

960
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:42,649
detection so I would recommend speak to

961
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:44,120
microsoft india the microsoft booth they

962
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:46,250
have a bunch of tsps there to help

963
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:48,440
answer that question is it a<font color="#E5E5E5"> product or</font>

964
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:50,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm just talking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a basic services</font>

965
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,250
that a company should look into a lot of

966
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:53,930
that is baked into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> service and then</font>

967
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:56,330
I think they're different tiers of azure

968
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:58,129
as you go as your company<font color="#E5E5E5"> decides to</font>

969
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:59,500
adopt a few tears they have different

970
00:38:58,130 --> 00:39:01,810
detections

971
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,940
that get big into office 365 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Asia</font>

972
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:17,350
but depending on what you ended up

973
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:19,060
purchasing there we go did we definitely

974
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:20,500
have a huge booth here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the lots of</font>

975
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,940
folks<font color="#E5E5E5"> are microsoft india so if you have</font>

00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,470
specific questions about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how your</font>

977
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:25,450
technical account managers can help you
