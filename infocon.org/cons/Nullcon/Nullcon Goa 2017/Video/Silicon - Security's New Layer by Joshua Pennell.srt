00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:17,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">I often say I'm here as the smartest</font>

out of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> company are done by the team</font>

9
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:29,070
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and we we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a merry</font>

10
00:00:26,429 --> 00:00:30,859
band of pirates that are very very smart

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:33,200
as you can probably see by our research

12
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:37,170
so today we're going to talk about

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,120
hardware I think we all<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that in the</font>

14
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:41,240
software world we've made great strides

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,339
and helping secure the software layer

16
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:46,650
which brings us kind of the next the

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,710
area where attacks you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

18
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:51,600
threshold of effort increases<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

19
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,010
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get remote foothold within the</font>

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,320
software layer people start looking

21
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,839
lower and lower in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> stack to identify</font>

22
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,940
new areas of weakness so just a quick

23
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,390
show of hands how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

24
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:07,158
the room have looked at a like a lab

25
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:10,200
seen a fib or a sim done any fib edits

26
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:12,060
I've got one<font color="#CCCCCC"> person how many people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the software industry software</font>

28
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,600
security industry<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great so we'll</font>

29
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,979
catch the presentation from software

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,740
engineers point of view into the

31
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,359
hardware world which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is great because</font>

32
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,949
that you can't divorce one from the

33
00:01:24,359 --> 00:01:28,380
other software<font color="#CCCCCC"> realized on hardware</font>

34
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:34,829
hardware relies on software<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay moving</font>

35
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:36,479
on so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a boy band that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I used to</font>

36
00:01:34,829 --> 00:01:38,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">be in actually this is my hacking group</font>

37
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,829
that we started in Seattle<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

38
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,869
crew of people went down to Def Con and

39
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:46,229
one capture the flag for three years in

40
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:48,329
a row as previously mentioned and and

41
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,740
then Jeff Moss asks us to retire to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lil</font>

42
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:52,079
other people to win because it's getting

43
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">a bit boring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing the same team show</font>

44
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:57,059
up year-over-year and win the contest so

45
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:58,590
so we kind of all SAT around after we

46
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,670
were asked to move on<font color="#CCCCCC"> and look at each</font>

47
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,399
<font color="#CCCCCC">other</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and thought well what are we going</font>

48
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,899
to do now and so we decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> to design</font>

49
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,420
the game so when we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> playing the</font>

50
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:09,149
game it was a score was kept on

51
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,340
literally paper and markers on the wall

52
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:14,000
so it'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> be like team red green blue and</font>

53
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,260
if you scored a point against Team Red

54
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,200
miles would go over<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

55
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,149
butcher paper and put 1.4 team packs and

56
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,500
so we thought we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> improve that and</font>

57
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:26,159
so what you see today when you go to

58
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,980
DEFCON the video the overheads the

59
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:32,760
augmented scoreboards the servers etc we

60
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:34,530
we actually designed the initial version

61
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:36,480
of that so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's kind of a bit of our</font>

62
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:37,920
legacy you can see hanging<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the losses</font>

63
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,780
but they've taken it so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> farther</font>

64
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,358
than where we left it so it's really

65
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,530
cool to see I got my start<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

66
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:45,180
industries because I'm passionate about

67
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,120
security I would be doing this whether I

68
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,560
got paid to do it<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not most just like</font>

69
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,000
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that work in the company</font>

70
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,799
the reason we<font color="#CCCCCC"> released interesting</font>

71
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,040
research is because this is what our

72
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:58,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys do they go home or on the weekends</font>

73
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,060
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at hoverboards or</font>

74
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:03,150
coconut<font color="#E5E5E5"> robots they're looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at a new</font>

75
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,950
IOT devices to see how how they can

76
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,870
establish<font color="#E5E5E5"> any kind of like footholds</font>

77
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:16,440
within the ecosystem and<font color="#CCCCCC"> unpublished</font>

78
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:19,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">research and so yeah we're going on so I</font>

79
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:22,109
found it ioactive in 1998 that was

80
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:24,569
before electricity it's grown into a

81
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:29,010
global consultancy obviously our<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

82
00:03:24,569 --> 00:03:30,720
a research first style organization and

83
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,099
the idea is that just like Ralph Nader

84
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,349
April I haven't heard of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them as have a</font>

85
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:37,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">u.s. guy his idea was to make</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sure that</font>

86
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:38,879
you know companies exist but when

87
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,709
they're releasing<font color="#E5E5E5"> products into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

88
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,010
world that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're doing so in a kind of</font>

89
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:46,859
a responsible manner so we kind of look

90
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:48,929
at ourselves in a way helping you that

91
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:51,870
thin blue blue line is helping the

92
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:54,269
community stay protected from some of

93
00:03:51,870 --> 00:04:00,180
these unneeded unnecessary threat so you

94
00:03:54,269 --> 00:04:02,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably seen in the digital space but</font>

95
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,970
saying that there's too much work as you

96
00:04:02,069 --> 00:04:07,230
can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that technology is increasing</font>

97
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:10,500
more and more rapidly Moore's Law is

98
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:12,030
almost needs to be a new law there's not

99
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,190
one day I wake up<font color="#E5E5E5"> that don't see</font>

100
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:15,979
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's occupied a new space</font>

101
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,209
in our life and that's going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> take</font>

102
00:04:15,979 --> 00:04:20,340
millions and millions and millions of

103
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:22,740
security practitioners working day and

104
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:24,810
night to ensure that that security

105
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:26,760
posture of those products<font color="#CCCCCC"> and services</font>

106
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:29,430
are actually secure because as you know

107
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,180
time to market often limits the security

108
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,699
voice at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tate</font>

109

<font color="#E5E5E5">about it on bug track etc so the more</font>

00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,750
you guys get involved and<font color="#E5E5E5"> excited about</font>

sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we come about the things that</font>

117
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:57,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">we go on here i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

118
00:04:53,130 --> 00:04:59,880
curiosity that really leads our research

119
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:04,530
body so you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> have seen that the</font>

120
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:08,210
g-pack that came out last year that was

121
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:11,340
basically the first remote purely remote

122
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:13,979
takeover of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> vehicle through its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> calm</font>

123
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:15,359
systems and cellular link and that that

124
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:18,449
was basically kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a quick case in</font>

125
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">point where you can understand that just</font>

126
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:23,880
connecting devices to the internet or

127
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,120
cellular networks etc as a feature or

128
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:30,210
cool like call home or get your new

129
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,770
google updates etc might not be such a

130

great<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea without doing appropriate</font>

136
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:49,409
at low speed thankfully but who knows

00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,710
what that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wired reporter was thinking to</font>

139
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:57,599
it yeah the semi truck coming behind him

140
00:05:54,990 --> 00:06:00,030
when the car drove off the road he must

audited those things anybody and so we

179
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:29,340
took upon ourselves look at them and the

201
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:20,940
were able<font color="#CCCCCC"> to demonstrate that as well</font>

204
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:29,010
to the internet so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can kind of see</font>

205
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:31,920
there's this reoccurring theme that

206
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:34,650
technology as we know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> early and</font>

207
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:36,780
it's a development gets released into

208
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:39,929
the public and kind of needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have an</font>

209
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:41,490
extra set of eyes on it and today is

210
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:43,309
kind of like that challenge goes out to

211
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:47,370
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys if you see something come out</font>

212
00:08:43,309 --> 00:08:49,560
fire up I to pro go grab some fuzz

213
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,570
testing frameworks and go nuts on it

214
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:55,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">because it's really nobody else is doing</font>

215
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:57,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">it it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of just us</font>

216
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,130
I'm probably awesome art research to we

217
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:01,120
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> hacked a robot so you know</font>

218
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:04,510
everybody's talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going to</font>

219
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:07,510
be replaced by robots and want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

220
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:09,939
attacked by a robot I'm not you ok so

221
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:11,920
more tech more threat getting the

222
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,290
hardware bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this presentation and</font>

223
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:18,189
stop me anytime if I'm boring you or if

00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:20,800
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> got any questions so I don't know if</font>

225
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,420
you remember in 2003 there is a there

226
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:25,449
was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> backdoor put into the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux kernel</font>

227
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:28,870
tree our source tree and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> backdoor</font>

228
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:30,130
is really clever it<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically as you can</font>

229
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:34,120
see down here at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> very bottom the</font>

230
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:35,790
slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is doing a check any kind of</font>

231
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:38,560
program that called the weight function

232
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:43,420
would go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and check some varmint</font>

233
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:45,670
variables and then reassign the user ID

234
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,469
a to<font color="#CCCCCC"> route and instead of this being a</font>

235
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:49,689
comparison operator it was a get

236
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:52,300
operator so this would give any program

237
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:55,420
that called wait for<font color="#E5E5E5"> root access on the</font>

238
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:57,729
system it's a one-character difference

239
00:09:55,420 --> 00:10:00,130
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know about you but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you</font>

240
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:02,140
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Linux source tree it's huge</font>

241
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:06,130
and the fun stuff like this is a would

242
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:09,130
be quite daunting the the trilogy of

243
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:10,720
backdoors here so if this can happen in

244
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:12,519
the software world what makes it not

245
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,640
possible to happen in the hardware world

246
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:20,230
well just last year the<font color="#E5E5E5"> University of</font>

247
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:22,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">Michigan released a paper on just that</font>

248
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:26,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">very subject and they found out that if</font>

249
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:28,899
a insider basically of a<font color="#CCCCCC"> fountain chip</font>

250
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:31,089
foundry I went ahead and<font color="#E5E5E5"> added one more</font>

251
00:10:28,899 --> 00:10:32,500
cell to the mask and the mask is

252
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:34,779
basically the blueprint for the chip

253
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:37,149
that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go ahead and add this</font>

254
00:10:34,779 --> 00:10:40,180
backdoor and this backdoor would be just

255
00:10:37,149 --> 00:10:45,130
as subtle as that linux back door was

256
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:47,890
it's hard to detect<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a one extra</font>

257
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:49,000
cell in a million gate and basically the

258
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:51,430
way it would work is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you would</font>

259
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,649
visit a web page or god forbid you

260
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:56,859
download that exe at somebody sent you

261
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:58,930
an email and it would run<font color="#E5E5E5"> some programs</font>

262
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:01,870
that would purposely and passively

263
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:03,760
charge that cell and a<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain point it</font>

264
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:05,800
would kick over and trigger a function

265
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,710
within the chip that would put the chip

266
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:10,599
into basically system mode or ring 0

267
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:13,270
letting anything on that chip now run as

268
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:17,350
root I don't know at you but acts kind

269
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:19,930
of creepy and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know anybody right</font>

270
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:22,870
now that their job is exclusively to

271
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:24,939
check masks before it goes to production

272
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:28,900
i dunno large software<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies</font>

273
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:31,990
employee teams of former intelligent

do nothing but monitor their employee

workforce for these kind of insiders

278
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:42,340
because there are quite a few to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

honest of people working<font color="#CCCCCC"> for foreign</font>

governments and technology companies

281

that do nothing but insert backdoors or

282
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:52,540
copy code out or give information about

283

the vehicle take to your data center

388
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,990

goes into<font color="#E5E5E5"> a watch list and so oh look</font>

boxes put their own firmware on and then

395
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:38,209
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have the OEM tape tape it</font>

401
00:16:47,990 --> 00:16:52,850
a reason to be concerned and<font color="#CCCCCC"> again this</font>

402
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:54,829
is all this<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't conspiracy theory it's</font>

403
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:57,560
all documented and you can take a look

404
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:59,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">at it and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that's why BTW which</font>

00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:01,670
is a big telecom provider in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UK went</font>

ahead and<font color="#CCCCCC"> they bought huawei kit and</font>

407
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:08,420
they did nothing for the first three

years<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think maybe six reverse engineer</font>

00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,930
at pentester at reverse engineers some

410
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:13,190
more because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think they just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> felt that</font>

411
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,350
everything was compromised anyway so

412
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:18,199
might as well buy the kit that's cheap

413
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:19,879
her and put the security investment on

414
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:21,550
it so the money they save they just

415
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,530
bought they hired which the security

416
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:26,869
teams to nothing contest the hell out of

417
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:28,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">it and then rolled out across the entire</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> telecom interesting a new approaches</font>

to life<font color="#CCCCCC"> I guess help Snowden so we've</font>

421
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:41,870
talked a little bit about what the

422
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:44,929
problem is way I see it

423
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:46,370
and I guess the idea too is understand

424
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:49,190
the attackers<font color="#CCCCCC"> in there and there were</font>

425
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:51,679
with all so it's classic threat taxonomy

426
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:54,559
you got the outsider<font color="#CCCCCC"> person looking in</font>

427
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:57,430
could be a hobbyist or somebody a little

428
00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:00,050
bit more clever knowledgeable insider

429
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:01,910
think maybe like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a snowed Mike person</font>

430
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:04,040
but with<font color="#CCCCCC"> hardware skills and then class</font>

431
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:08,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">three organizations that's the one I'm</font>

432
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:08,590
I'm a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit keeps me up at night</font>

433
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:12,680
goodness note their agenda I mean we

434
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:14,660
have foreign governments right now

435
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,130
interfering with elections which I think

436
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,960
super funny because the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I</font>

437
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:19,580
heard that I might ask bad and then I

438
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:22,220
found out that that's been going on for

439
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:24,199
a long long time not just Russia

440
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:31,130
invented the ability to influence

441
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:33,200
elections remotely<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright case studies</font>

442
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:35,270
so on this on the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> couple slides</font>

443
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,190
instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for the geopolitical</font>

444
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:40,429
references<font color="#CCCCCC"> about why things are bad this</font>

445
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:45,530
is more profiteering so a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> chip</font>

446
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:49,030
hacking industry became more public when

447
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:52,820
it came<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the satellite TV</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pay-tv</font>

448
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:56,149
Carson<font color="#CCCCCC"> Knoll knows a lot about basically</font>

449
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:58,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was a company called News Corp</font>

450
00:18:56,150 --> 00:19:01,750
that spun up another company called nds

451
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:04,820
and ESS job was to ensure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

452
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:08,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">satellite TV broadcasts were secure and</font>

453
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:10,520
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> its competitors or not and this is</font>

454
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:12,620
it it's pretty amazing if you have it a

455
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:14,150
little bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> time I recommend reading a</font>

456
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:17,780
book called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Murdoch's pirates</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

457
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:21,830
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually see how people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

458
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:23,270
technology to actively undermine the

00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:25,730
interests of their competitors<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

460
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:27,800
point they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> put the company</font>

461
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:31,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">called on digital out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of business in</font>

462
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:33,020
2002 because of the what they were up to

463
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:35,570
so every time on digital would release a

464
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:38,090
patch for their their their smart card

465
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:40,370
basically nds would pay a group of

466
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:43,639
hackers to hack it again and release the

467
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:47,239
exploit on a website called soic which

468
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:50,450
is the houses it will compute that<font color="#CCCCCC"> India</font>

469
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:54,429
also funded which was Murdoch's money so

470
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:54,429
kind of like they

471
00:19:55,570 --> 00:20:01,760
apple<font color="#CCCCCC"> is giving a bad example it's</font>

472
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:03,920
basically like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're you're pretending</font>

473
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,210
you're normal and<font color="#CCCCCC"> europe upstanding</font>

474
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:07,340
citizen but in the meantime you're

475
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:09,620
completely stealing the engine<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of</font>

476
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">your competitors car you know to get up</font>

477
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,679
in the morning and go to work and they

478
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:14,120
can't get there because the car engines

479
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:16,820
gone so it's a little underhanded and

480
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:19,729
eventually nds was sued along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with news</font>

481
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:23,419
corp and they settled out a court of

482
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:27,440
course and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it nds ended up</font>

483
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:29,180
paying<font color="#E5E5E5"> $1,500 total to echostar one of</font>

484

485
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:35,450
canal plus<font color="#E5E5E5"> the basically worked a deal</font>

486
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:38,630
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> News Corp ends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up by one of their</font>

487
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:40,850
failing companies in Italy but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

488
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:42,590
gravity of the situation is that the

489
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:44,240
hardware security actually caused a

490
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:46,159
large company a company owes first to

491
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,720
market in the satellite<font color="#CCCCCC"> TV space to go</font>

492
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:50,740
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of business</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think that's</font>

493
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,660
something to really think about it

494
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:54,950
wasn't could have been mismanagement but

495
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:58,970
it certainly doesn't help when your

496
00:20:54,950 --> 00:21:01,010
subscriber base doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay Oh or</font>

497
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:02,720
favorite here Nintendo<font color="#CCCCCC"> versus Atari so</font>

498
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:05,900
Atari kind of crashed and burned in the

499
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,030
80s<font color="#CCCCCC"> they had a they had one bad game now</font>

500
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,470
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a few bad games they didn't control</font>

501
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,030
the quality of the games that were going

502
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:13,610
on to the console so people kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of got</font>

503
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:19,730
a little disenfranchised with a product

504
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:21,949
so they had a hard time then<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

505
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:23,540
thought Nintendo enter the market space

506
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:25,730
and intended a great job because they

507
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:28,280
had this chip a kick which is basically

508
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:30,410
as a fancy word for drm technology the

509
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:32,510
only allowed games are approved by<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

510
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:35,210
to enter<font color="#E5E5E5"> into their walled garden</font>

511
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:36,890
basically well Atari I wanted in on that

512
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:40,460
action and so instead<font color="#E5E5E5"> of reverse</font>

513
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:42,590
engineering the chip like<font color="#E5E5E5"> nds did they</font>

514
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:45,050
went ahead and spoke to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> patent</font>

515
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:46,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">office because they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were curious about</font>

516
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:48,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">whether or not there's some patent</font>

517
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:51,500
patent infringement or whatnot and the

518
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:52,940
Patent Office inadvertently or maybe I'm

519
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:59,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">not sure maybe they did on purpose they</font>

520
00:21:52,940 --> 00:22:02,570
gave Atari the actual methodology and I

521
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:04,220
maybe even code to the way that Nintendo

522
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:06,110
had implemented this kick chip now keep

523
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,970
in mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> the kick ship had withstood 20</font>

524
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,439
years of every

525
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:12,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">eres engineer and nobody</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can get around</font>

526
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,270
it other than they actually that some

527
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:14,980
people did get<font color="#CCCCCC"> around it and the way</font>

528
00:22:13,270 --> 00:22:16,960
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> got around as they stunned it with</font>

529
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:19,659
27 volts or something to stun<font color="#CCCCCC"> the chip</font>

530
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,490
on boot knock it off line<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there a</font>

531
00:22:19,659 --> 00:22:24,490
third party game loading really

532
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:27,400
interesting but on anyways long story

533
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:29,140
short they created the chip so they

534
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:31,000
could enter into this market so another

535
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:36,549
example of people hacking at the

536
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,900
hardware layer to enable a<font color="#CCCCCC"> profit not</font>

537
00:22:36,549 --> 00:22:41,668
sure why they didn't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> lie some</font>

538
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:44,559
nintendo stuff but they got sued as well

539
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:48,100
US<font color="#CCCCCC"> patent office super wasn't happy with</font>

540
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:52,799
what they did obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rest is</font>

541
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:55,539
history so you can kind of see<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font>

542
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,520
some spooky cloak-and-dagger stuff and

543
00:22:55,539 --> 00:22:59,830
then we have the classic profiteering at

544
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,740
play as far as the threat actors in the

545
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:07,960
hardware space so quick overview in

546
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:10,059
state of embedded security so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we figured</font>

547
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,070
out software security we you know a bit

548
00:23:10,059 --> 00:23:16,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">for much better than we used to be you</font>

549
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:19,539
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> L else one paper from 2006 and as</font>

550
00:23:16,330 --> 00:23:22,389
applicable as it once was but now here

551
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:24,510
comes I<font color="#CCCCCC"> ohe in IOT that's the nice fancy</font>

552
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:28,240
word for embedded systems with either

553

555
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the checks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the their larger</font>

556
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:39,669
counterparts do so now your buffer

557
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:42,130
overflows start to work again which is

558
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:47,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">exciting for people who have gotten</font>

559
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:51,460
bored lately and the sheer size of IOT

560
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:54,549
is impressive so in 2020 they they quote

561
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:58,480
that 60 billion IOT devices will be on

562
00:23:54,549 --> 00:24:04,210
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet functioning and we just saw</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Brian crowd does</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody know why Brian</font>

566
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:16,870
Krebs keeps getting attacked I know but

567
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:20,700
I you've got to feel important right

568

get him busted for heroin saying and

he's done that<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's done these is</font>

583
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:56,200
the security community was like like we

584
00:24:54,310 --> 00:24:58,030
always do pitchforks enough you know

585
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,220

00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:09,970
we're back to it's up to us to stem the

589
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:12,610
tide and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the research and get</font>

590
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:15,130
the guidance and help people down the

Socratic path of doing security right

592
00:25:15,130 --> 00:25:18,880
the first time to release it release a

respond to through instant handling

598
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:31,840
patch updates PR etc so when you're

599
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:33,700
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Hardware people maybe</font>

600
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:40,750
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> let them know that we're trying to</font>

601
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:43,750
save you money too so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you saw some the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">attack the traffic system they want to</font>

604
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:53,200
basically make cities completely

605
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:54,959
connected and that means a lot of IOT so

606
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,610
if your city is thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this soon</font>

607
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,350
to roll it out if they have already see

00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:04,240
can actually pull up a smartphone app

00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:06,460
and dim the lights of the city from<font color="#CCCCCC"> our</font>

612
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:15,300
them sooner rather than later we're not

<font color="#E5E5E5">going to run out of work anytime soon</font>

614
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:18,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font>

615
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:24,668
hmm so now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff</font>

616
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:27,039
maybe you're all just so we all know i

617
00:26:24,669 --> 00:26:28,779
am not a hardware hacker<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a CID</font>

619
00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:33,850
those conversations find somebody else

00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:35,379
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to present a story alright</font>

621
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:37,779
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> here's our lab we have Q hardware lab</font>

622
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:41,169
ones in Seattle and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other ones in</font>

623
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:42,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">Madrid reason that we built these labs</font>

624
00:26:41,169 --> 00:26:44,740
as you can kind of guess by now is that

625
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:48,669
there's overwhelming need to do hardware

626
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:50,799
security in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Seattle lab we have what we</font>

627
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:53,289
call a scanning electron microscope we

628
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:56,580
have a fib focused ion beam laser

629
00:26:53,289 --> 00:27:00,850
confocal equipment full chemical room

630

probing stations and garage specifically

equipped for automotive research and

632
00:27:03,669 --> 00:27:12,640
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> madrid labs a bit similar but has a</font>

specific department for embedded<font color="#CCCCCC"> IOT</font>

634
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:20,830
systems and to do tamper resistance

635
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:22,720
testing so here's the one of the things

636
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:24,970
that you know from the the world is the

637
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:28,330
root of<font color="#CCCCCC"> trustees these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> microchips that</font>

638
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:30,929
are in end up being TPM they end up

639
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:32,678
Afeni cating your handset to network

640
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:35,260
making sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're paid your</font>

642
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:40,090
borders make sure your printer cartridge

643
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:41,860
is actually legit and your auto parts

644
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:45,070
were bought from the auto part

645
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:48,158
manufacturer that wanted you to only buy

646
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:50,350
their OEM parts so the interesting thing

647
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:53,230
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I've learned over the past year is</font>

648
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:55,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">that again just like Atari a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

649
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:56,830
companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> are like they want to offer a</font>

go off to one of these black hat if you

652

call black<font color="#CCCCCC"> grey it's kind of up in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

653
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:05,649
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the legality of all is will</font>

654
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:06,730
go off to one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these organizations and</font>

655
00:28:05,649 --> 00:28:07,959
they'll give them the product<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

656
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:09,789
say look I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to offer</font>

657
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:12,700
printer cartridges printer cartridges

658
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:14,980
for that printer and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> team</font>

659
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:16,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">will go ahead and use their FID there's</font>

660
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:18,730
some to break down the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chip and</font>

661
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:20,620
understand how it works reverse the

662
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,390
protocol and then hand<font color="#E5E5E5"> it back to the</font>

663
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:24,370
client who then goes off and makes a

664
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:27,000
third-party product so there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

665
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:30,370
that in this hardware hacking industry

666

not so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the offensive Sizemore on</font>

00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:32,459
the

00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:38,939
I want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> offer product into a closed</font>

669
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:42,030
wall community so here's a basic<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

670
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:45,840
anatomy of a chip nothing new here

00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:48,059
processor memory<font color="#CCCCCC"> eeprom interesting</font>

672
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,919
there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that this goes really</font>

673
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:52,170
deep and we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to get into all</font>

674
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:54,540
of it today but uh some cute things

675
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:56,400
they've done is it fuses on the board to

676
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:57,960
ensure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if somebody's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font>

677
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,120
reverse engineer it they can't just<font color="#E5E5E5"> hook</font>

678
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:02,690
onto the jtag which is base<font color="#CCCCCC"> wade debug</font>

679
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:08,100
port and pull off the firm are too<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy</font>

680
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:10,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the old days they did but a female to</font>

681
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,510
chip down and polish it and then scanner

682
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:15,300
this is what you end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> having to look</font>

683
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:16,530
at so from the attackers toolbox like

684
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,540
the software world you know you've got

685
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:21,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">the classic buffer overflow sequel</font>

687
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:27,059
one air is the same kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attacks but</font>

688
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:30,540
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware within the hardware world</font>

689
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:32,870
and you know this requires IE background

690
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:35,520
come time sometimes it just requires a

691
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:38,010
insatiable curiosity for hardware like

692
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,650
the guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> oliver who did a lot of the chip</font>

693
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:43,320
hacking back in the satellite days he

694
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:44,850
just loved this stuff so he just kept

695
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,559
hacking on it hacking on and hacking on

696
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:48,090
it and he was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chief pirate for a</font>

697
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,678
long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the point where he's</font>

698
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:52,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting paid a quarter million pounds</font>

699
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:55,350

700
00:29:52,100 --> 00:30:00,240

701
00:29:55,350 --> 00:30:03,240
with a bunch of basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> like street</font>

703
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,510
and he would say<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the quarter</font>

704
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:08,970
million and you guys can go<font color="#CCCCCC"> ahead and</font>

00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:10,440
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the blueprint and run with it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he</font>

analysis and the software review world

with it either by side-channel attacks

white box review where you're actually

730

looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chip figuring out how the</font>

designers lays out and where to attack

732
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:16,220
you specifically so there's a glitching

733
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:19,730
attack both on the power and the clock

734
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:22,220
and basically imagine just<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

735
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:24,200
abuse the functionality to chip so it

736
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:26,929
does things like spit out its firmware

737
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,570
or spit out keys because you over-revved

738
00:31:26,929 --> 00:31:32,540
or you under rub the clock you made it

739
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:34,070
go plus 6 volts and then down<font color="#CCCCCC"> them like-</font>

743
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:45,200

744
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:47,390
a power analysis they've been amazing

745
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,580
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will get into bit later on</font>

746
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:51,170
power analysis and timing attacks to

747
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:53,659
where they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> monitor the</font>

748
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:56,690
power supply of the device and figure

00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:58,760
out what key it generated<font color="#E5E5E5"> size etc I</font>

750
00:31:56,690 --> 00:32:02,150
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a mind-boggling way above</font>

751
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:06,160
my pay grade stops but if you're

752
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:10,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">interested in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this the fascinating read</font>

753
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:12,590
so here's a jtag interface good for

00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:15,290
again removing firmware reverse engineer

755
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:17,870
and find vulnerabilities or key

756
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:19,280

761
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:30,590
on you end up having<font color="#CCCCCC"> to flash the board</font>

762
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:34,550
with over the jtag port with their

763
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:37,120
firmware and you'll be happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> to know</font>

764
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:40,010
like silly things like default passwords

00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">exists on these right on these embedded</font>

devices static passwords that never

767
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,460
changed burned in the EEPROM things that

768
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:49,159
you know you thought were dead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and gone</font>

769
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:50,990
from years ago of now resurfaced and are

770
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:53,600
alive and well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're really rookie</font>

771
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:56,970
security mistakes

772
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:59,250
because it here's a picture of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a anti</font>

773
00:32:56,970 --> 00:33:03,330
tour of a glow and jtag views as you can

774
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:05,340
see<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the top right hand corner there's</font>

775
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:07,350
you can see the circuits<font color="#E5E5E5"> not connected</font>

776
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:09,240
that's what<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looks like when a fuse is</font>

777
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:12,510
blown and then on the bottom bottom

778
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,830
right connected so with it civ one of

779
00:33:12,510 --> 00:33:15,600
the attacks you can do is you can load

780
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:18,720
this up this chip up in the fit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

781
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:21,209
can re-establish that circuit with a fib

782
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,279
edit so now the jtags reattached and you

783
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:28,649
can dump<font color="#E5E5E5"> the firmware or whatever you're</font>

784
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:30,480
after the other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do is say</font>

785
00:33:28,649 --> 00:33:31,860
that the embedded device is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bootloader</font>

786
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,809
sometimes the bootloader is not

787
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:35,789
authenticated you can go ahead and feed

788
00:33:33,809 --> 00:33:38,940
it bits whatever you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

789
00:33:35,789 --> 00:33:42,260
boot it not necessarily at a secure

790
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:45,179
vital song by design by default method

791
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:47,970
and now moving<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to more interesting</font>

792
00:33:45,179 --> 00:33:49,700
things the embedded world's good it's

793
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:51,659
fun stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can get into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that hacking</font>

794
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,980
probably a new if you want to get the

795
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:55,110
equipment you're going to run anywhere

796
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:58,139
from maybe a thousand to five thousand

797
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:59,699
dollars for a rig and you can you can

798
00:33:58,139 --> 00:34:02,760
take a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> classes that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they have</font>

799
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:04,710
here or you can talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Dimitri about</font>

800
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:07,408
taking amazing hardware hacking classes

801
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:10,230
and I recommend<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do that I might you</font>

802
00:34:07,409 --> 00:34:12,030
might see me<font color="#CCCCCC"> in there who knows invasive</font>

803
00:34:10,230 --> 00:34:13,530
chip hacking this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we're</font>

804
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:15,470
actually decapping the chip and put it

805
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:17,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">in to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the sin of the fit and the</font>

806
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:22,859
reactive on and be mature and in what we

807
00:34:17,969 --> 00:34:24,629
need first step of it is to open the

808
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:27,000
package which means using either a

809
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:30,259
mechanical or chemical process a lot of

810
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,940
the video that a bit later then we

811
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:35,869
examine a<font color="#CCCCCC"> the chip under a microscope to</font>

812
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:38,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">try to understand how it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> works and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

813
00:34:35,869 --> 00:34:41,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">we we spend more time actually trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

814
00:34:38,609 --> 00:34:42,149
conduct the attack offline<font color="#CCCCCC"> basic school</font>

815
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:44,879
once we've imaged the chip and

816
00:34:42,149 --> 00:34:47,190
understand where world components are on

817
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:50,118
how to go about attack in it and then we

818
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:54,569
come back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fib to do those edits</font>

819
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:58,650
stop me if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm you got any questions at</font>

820
00:34:54,569 --> 00:35:00,720
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so on the right hand side</font>

821
00:34:58,650 --> 00:35:03,630
you can see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> what that's actually a</font>

822
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:06,209
sip at it there they've mailed it down a

823
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:06,540
bit top right corner so you're hacking

824
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:09,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">at</font>

825
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:12,060
the nanometer level which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is pretty</font>

826
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:13,080
amazing and for me I see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a rocket</font>

827
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,910
science and when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys are working</font>

828
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:17,370
away in the lab I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like I'm not</font>

829
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:19,730
worthy pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing stuff kid in the</font>

830
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:22,140
candy factory when you see it all done

831
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:23,640
and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of it's really cool to the</font>

832
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:26,700
software<font color="#E5E5E5"> engineers to understand that</font>

833
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:29,940
our software you know you get compiled

834
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:31,500
down to in essence<font color="#CCCCCC"> its chain of 10 that</font>

835
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:33,390
then we trust to run on those hardware

836
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:35,610
and then you see somebody breaking the

837
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:37,740
security module of that of that ship

838
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:39,780
that you relied on to generate aes-256

<font color="#CCCCCC">Keys you're like wait that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no did you</font>

840
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:43,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">just got the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aef key that I've been</font>

841
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:45,899
storing there for years that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> good</font>

842
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:47,550
silly things like that things that you

00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:50,640
know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> personally the software dev never</font>

844
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:52,860
never thought were possible there's one

845
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:57,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">a case study where there was a crypto</font>

have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to replace them every so often and</font>

849
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:09,570
these devices were then thrown into into

850
00:36:05,370 --> 00:36:11,100
a garbage Kansas guy paid the cleaner to

851
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:13,140
next time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're taking out the trash</font>

852
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:15,230
please give me that crypto processor and

853
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:17,879
so guy did and what he was<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font>

854
00:36:15,230 --> 00:36:21,180
because the old days he was able to do a

855
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:24,060
memory remnants attack the key the

856
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:26,910
master key for the entire<font color="#CCCCCC"> banky bank it</font>

857
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:28,980
was burned into the<font color="#CCCCCC"> memory and he was</font>

858
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:32,330
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dump that and get the key and</font>

859
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:36,120
decrypt all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> bank's transactions so</font>

860
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:37,650
fun stuff that the crypto processes are

861
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:40,380
amazing they're there in ways they have

862
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:42,600
left thermite loads on them so if you

863
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:44,820
open the casing it has a shape flap that

864
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,350
blows apart the chip on the later one I

865
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:48,360
don't know about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's like</font>

866
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:50,880
hacker folklore you know or somebody

867
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:52,740
grabs your hard disk and obliterate we

868
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,790
all want<font color="#E5E5E5"> that right well they've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got it</font>

869
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:59,609
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the banking industry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so um d</font>

870
00:36:56,790 --> 00:37:01,560
kappa chip you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can do rear side probing</font>

871
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:03,480
attacks which means that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just flip</font>

872
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,610
the board over or the chip over and you

873
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:08,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">can use UV to go through layers and</font>

874
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:11,730
you're not actually having<font color="#CCCCCC"> to mill at</font>

875
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:13,470
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chip etc some reason you can physics</font>

876
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:15,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">I don't get it but via you can look</font>

877
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:16,439
through the chip<font color="#CCCCCC"> for layers of seven</font>

878
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:18,650
layers and get the whole readout of the

879
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,650
board

880
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:29,490
ok the are reactive ion that thing has

881
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:30,810
the we have this really<font color="#CCCCCC"> cool video of it</font>

882
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:33,930
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wasn't able to get it because the</font>

883
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:36,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">network was bad ok so here's our</font>

884
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:39,359
chemical bath I've got a video coming up

885
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:40,649
basically the chip is in the package and

886
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:43,220
to get at the chip you need to remove

887
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:45,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">the package so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can get up the actual</font>

888
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:50,578
advice itself and start the polishing

889
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:51,868
process so see if this works I sped it

890
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:54,060
up so you guys don't have to stare<font color="#CCCCCC"> at it</font>

891
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:55,650
for too long usually takes a bit more

892
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:59,310
time than this and you definitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

893
00:37:55,650 --> 00:38:00,990
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have this is in a fume hood so</font>

894
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:04,200
when the process is doing its thing

895
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:05,520
you're not inhaling toxic gases you

896
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,990
should have seen the insurance coming in

897
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,849
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we ask</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for the insurance</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> policy for</font>

898
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:11,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">this it was a funny conversation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

899
00:38:08,849 --> 00:38:12,930
like now what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys do again looks</font>

900
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:18,328
like a scene out of breaking<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad or</font>

901
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:21,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatnot so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's the capping a chip for</font>

902
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:25,470
later processing in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the FIB</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and moving</font>

00:38:21,569 --> 00:38:27,569
over<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the probing station</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm sure in</font>

904
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:29,129
five to<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten years if you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a security</font>

905
00:38:27,569 --> 00:38:32,460
shop you're going to have to have all

906
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:34,200
this kit with the embedded<font color="#E5E5E5"> system going</font>

907
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:37,310
the way they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are and security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

908
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:39,868
pushed farther and farther down in the

00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:42,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the chip for example intel</font>

910
00:38:39,869 --> 00:38:45,270
introduced another ring to the x86

00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:47,849
architecture a negative 14 for their

912
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:49,050
trusted computing platform I don't know

913
00:38:47,849 --> 00:38:53,190
you guys know you have entire software

914
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:55,980
suite running and<font color="#E5E5E5"> ring- one they haven't</font>

915
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:59,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">made a edits to the x intel chip</font>

architecture<font color="#E5E5E5"> in decades first time so</font>

917
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:04,890
now we examine the chip<font color="#CCCCCC"> oftentimes you</font>

918
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:07,020
looking for repeating patterns looking

for the core looking for a prom

920
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:10,800
sometimes they encrypt the eeprom you

921
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:14,009
can you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> visually read it</font>

922
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:17,280
out with a microscope 10 most see

923
00:39:14,010 --> 00:39:19,619
problems are encrypted communication

924
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,420
paths in between the devices they used

925
00:39:19,619 --> 00:39:23,220
to be on unencrypted buses but now they

926
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:25,800
encrypt the bus because they say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it</font>

927
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:28,348
etc reading being able to actively read

00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,500
data off off<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bus with a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chip when</font>

929
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:33,970
its run<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

930
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:35,770
that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> amazing but as we move on</font>

931
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:38,439
in time it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're not hacking like</font>

932
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:41,950
the old days of pay-tv the we've gone

933
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:45,550
from 134 nanometer traces down too much

934
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:46,990
smaller in the 90 range and the the

935
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:48,400
chips are laid out not necessarily by

936
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:51,180
hand anymore they're laid out<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

937
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:54,340
machines which makes them very hard to

938
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:56,020
follow and understand because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

939
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:58,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">very complex problem and a lot of the</font>

940
00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:01,259
labs like us or working on that day to

941
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">figure out how to remedy that problem</font>

942
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:06,130
it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a lot of software and</font>

943
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:09,640
five minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I got a lot of</font>

944
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:11,170
software<font color="#CCCCCC"> and hard work so got about five</font>

945
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:13,839
minutes here and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I try a speed through</font>

946
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:16,480
this this work here was done by Dimitri

947
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:18,400
who's an amazing guy out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Berlin to</font>

948
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:22,990
get a chance to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to him tell him I</font>

949
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:27,220
said hi he's a love chip hacking so here

950
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:29,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">we go he's done some photo infrared</font>

951
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:32,259
photo work on ships and this is actually

952
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:36,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">what a chip looks like under infrared</font>

953
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:38,830
light to without<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a microscope doing</font>

954
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,480
its thing I mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's pretty</font>

955
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:43,060
cool it's loading data onto a bus

956
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:47,050
analyzing it and then eventually<font color="#E5E5E5"> he'll</font>

957
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:49,750
be using<font color="#E5E5E5"> this to extract an Aes key so</font>

958
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:51,820
when you see the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> phipps 148 in or a</font>

959
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:54,190
common criteria rating don't always

960
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:57,790
believe it unless<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have smart people</font>

961
00:40:54,190 --> 00:41:03,760
like Dimitri given a whack at it or us

962
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:05,710
and you can see here's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> X activity on</font>

963
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,890
the chip it's like hacking the matrix

964
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:10,480
but in the physical world at that bright

965
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:13,420
spot on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right-hand side that is</font>

966
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,980
actually the AES engine so you look at

967
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:18,040
these that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the million</font>

968
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:19,720
the billion gate problem may be<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

969
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,920
this technique you can kind of isolate

970
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:22,660
the area to chip that you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

971
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:25,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at because you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can see almost in</font>

972
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:28,660
the census heat signature or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2a go</font>

973
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:31,960
explore good stuff

974
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:34,618
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay the pro mutation said the fibs</font>

975
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:36,819
reuse did you edit and<font color="#CCCCCC"> set up pad</font>

976
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:39,160
basically going through metal layers one

977
00:41:36,819 --> 00:41:41,109
or through seven depending what you're

978
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:44,440
after usually after data bus or<font color="#E5E5E5"> kwok</font>

979
00:41:41,109 --> 00:41:46,779
line email a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hole and in this case they</font>

980
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:49,420
have a security mesh this image<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

981
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:52,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">taken by Oliver the master hacker from</font>

982
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:54,250
from the pay-tv days and as you can see

983
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,809
where that cross is is where he's done a

984
00:41:54,250 --> 00:41:57,010
sieve at it he's milled between the

985
00:41:55,809 --> 00:41:58,450
security match in the security master

986
00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:00,730
day so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> he breached the security match</font>

987
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:03,069
the chip is close to<font color="#E5E5E5"> zero with peas and</font>

988
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:05,280
destroy itself but you have a fib you

989
00:42:03,069 --> 00:42:08,710
can go in between those very small

990
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,869
traces and make a drill hole down to the

991
00:42:08,710 --> 00:42:13,200
lower data<font color="#E5E5E5"> box and start to extract data</font>

992
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:15,640
and that's what he did<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the situation</font>

993
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,379
that's what you would use a fib 4 and on

994
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:19,960
the on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left hand side you can see</font>

995
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:21,490
how the chip has a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a copper</font>

996
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:24,700
that's been exposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that's where</font>

997
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:26,229
that the foundry had made a mistake or

998
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:28,899
the designer of the chip and didn't

999
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:30,520
actually extend the security mesh over

1000
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:33,609
the entire chip so you can see that

1001
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:36,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">there they expose the the power line so</font>

1002
00:42:33,609 --> 00:42:39,569
now you can do some glitching attacks so

1003
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:39,569
nothing is perfect just like in software

1004
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:46,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok few minutes guys you're almost done</font>

1005
00:42:44,799 --> 00:42:48,640
thanks for<font color="#E5E5E5"> bearing with me all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

1006
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,400
here's the mennonites video for you of

1007
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,990
us zooming around a chip the difference

1008
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,309
with those videos that we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> able</font>

1009
00:42:52,990 --> 00:42:57,399
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do some pretty high resolution</font>

1010
00:42:54,309 --> 00:42:59,230
imagery and it's a it's down to we can

1011
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:00,549
go down to 40 nanometers and when we

1012
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:03,940
first start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hardware lab we're</font>

1013
00:43:00,549 --> 00:43:11,200
doing 134 nanometers so we've come quite

1014
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:17,069
a long ways and go so the first stop on

1015
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:19,328
<font color="#CCCCCC">the tour is flash memory there's M&N</font>

1016
00:43:17,069 --> 00:43:24,190
this looks much better on my screen by

1017
00:43:19,329 --> 00:43:27,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">the way and then now we've looked</font>

1018
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:29,390
looking up some fake flakes a glass that

1019
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:31,190
ended up on the chip

1020
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:33,259
there you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> barely see it but it's</font>

1021
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:37,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of like a shiny dot like the North</font>

1022
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:39,140
Star that's Phil metal and then the chip

1023
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:41,870
manufacturers go ahead and left<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh say a</font>

1024
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:43,819
nice note this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a reproduction of this</font>

1025
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:47,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">area's that prohibited so that will keep</font>

1026
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:50,000
us out of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for sure here we get to the</font>

1027
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:52,400
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> billion gate problem once it zooms</font>

1028
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,380
in you can start to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the complexity</font>

1029
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:56,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">and how these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't hand laid out</font>

1030
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:59,210
anymore they're laid out<font color="#E5E5E5"> by a computer</font>

1031
00:43:56,030 --> 00:44:01,640
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to tell which way is up</font>

1032
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:03,020
and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these circuits they don't</font>

1033
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:07,759
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even real circuits they just</font>

1034
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:11,180
put them in there to confuse you kind of

1035
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:18,380
like a paper tiger and then the next

1036
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:19,910
stop is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> power conduit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lighting all</font>

1037
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:24,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">right so you can see this is a hacking</font>

1038
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:27,470
in the 21st and a half century and that

1039
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:29,629
<font color="#CCCCCC">will move on from there so designing for</font>

1040
00:44:27,470 --> 00:44:31,430
security some of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to</font>

1041
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:33,530
keep in<font color="#CCCCCC"> mind is if you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're a</font>

1042
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:36,140
chip designer yeah don't don't make<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1043
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:37,400
component label your components get rid

1044
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:42,279
of your exposed debugging in our

1045
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:44,660
interfaces you know encrypt your memory

1046
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:48,110
definitely a<font color="#E5E5E5"> third-party look at your</font>

00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:49,970
tamper mechanisms don't leave a serial

1048
00:44:48,110 --> 00:44:51,230
console on your board and just like

1049
00:44:49,970 --> 00:44:54,770
shave off the header and hope nobody

1050
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:56,180
knows<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the rs-232 port don't put</font>

1051
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:57,290
back doors in your products like some

1052
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:58,640
people like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put back doors and</font>

1053
00:44:57,290 --> 00:45:00,529
they're embedded systems for maintenance

1054
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,330
reasons don't do that because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

1055
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:03,800
find them<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dumped</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the firmware you</font>

1056
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:05,360
will find it you just run strings

1057
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:07,070
against firmware and you find out<font color="#CCCCCC"> well</font>

1058
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,900
look there's the password using impasse

1059
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:11,020
and then they use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that same password</font>

1060
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:14,000
across all devices which now you've got

1061
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:16,190
14 million 40 million of them out in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1062
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:18,590
real<font color="#CCCCCC"> world and patching hardware is not</font>

1063
00:45:16,190 --> 00:45:23,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">as easy that's patching software and</font>

1064
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:23,740
cost tons of money the best practices

1065
00:45:24,410 --> 00:45:29,000
you know I think best practices is a go

1066
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:30,890
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> lots of training for this and</font>

1067
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,570
hopefully the hardware world will get<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1068
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:33,950
front of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right people to get them</font>

1069
00:45:32,570 --> 00:45:35,950
encouraged to talk to us<font color="#CCCCCC"> because right</font>

1070
00:45:33,950 --> 00:45:38,359
now it's kind of like the old<font color="#E5E5E5"> days of</font>

1071
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:40,879
security where people said the hackers

1072
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:44,060
weren't real and that's the the folklore

1073
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:46,610
of like unicorns and<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatnot let me tell</font>

1074
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:48,140
you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> 19 years ago everybody thought</font>

1075
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:49,760
hackers weren't real and I look at him

1076
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:51,410
you look at the TV and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're like front</font>

1077
00:45:49,760 --> 00:46:04,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">line center okay so that's it guys you</font>

1078
00:45:51,410 --> 00:46:05,899
made it any questions I'm a little jet

1079
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:13,090
lag so hopefully I didn't kill you with

1080
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:13,090
a boredom question anyone yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah</font>

1081
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:21,320
thank you I agree completely with your

1082
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:23,180
statements of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the early part of the</font>

1083
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:26,960
presentation about securing supply chain

1084
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:27,770
and trusting your your suppliers but

1085
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:32,270
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for an international</font>

00:46:32,270 --> 00:46:37,280
all over the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you have a large</font>

organizations in all in all countries

1089
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,500
all over the world how do you suggest

1090
00:46:39,350 --> 00:46:45,350
dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that in a acceptable way</font>

1091
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:48,410
when a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people are saying</font>

1092
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:50,540
produce here because it's cheaper when

1093
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:52,759
that same country is one that's not

1098
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:04,910
did and they said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so instead of</font>

paying you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a hundred dollars for</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">take that ninety dollars and we're going</font>

1103
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:16,580
to invest it back into security audits

1104
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:17,779
for that supply chain and to their

1105
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:19,880
credit they found lots of

1106
00:47:17,780 --> 00:47:21,380
vulnerabilities in those products and

1107
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:23,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">they were when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they handed them back</font>

1108

over a while way they were very<font color="#E5E5E5"> quick to</font>

1109
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:28,430
fix them so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't know that could be</font>

yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think I don't get the easy</font>

1115
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:44,240
one for that yeah it's a hard one I wish

1116
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:52,250
there was easy answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> Atticus moved back</font>

00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:54,589
to the abacus you know when we select a

1118
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:57,380
softer witness we asked for different

1119

set of controls and other things which

1120
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:03,620
we they can divorced it to get the

the hardware what type of is there any

1124
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:16,940
specific standards and other things came

1125
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,730
up right now to give them a comfort to

the prospective customer that these

1127

little<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about lenovo</font>

because once<font color="#E5E5E5"> well it has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get out from</font>

1129
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:31,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">the system so we is there any set of</font>

1130
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:33,440
standards which partner before when the

1131
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:35,720
partner screening is on for hardware

1132
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:39,140
they can give the satisfaction to the

1133
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:41,149
customer that their securities up to the

1134
00:48:39,140 --> 00:48:45,879
level and will not be compromised along

1135
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:45,880
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bundle with the software layer</font>

1136
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,230
so it let me<font color="#CCCCCC"> repeat the question so</font>

1137
00:48:49,730 --> 00:48:54,650
you're asking<font color="#E5E5E5"> what kind of assurances</font>

1138
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:56,480
can company give to their clients<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1139
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:59,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">what kind of due diligence they've done</font>

1140
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,010
on their part to<font color="#CCCCCC"> inator that their their</font>

1141
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:04,009
supply chain has been breached that<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1142
00:49:01,010 --> 00:49:07,570
you're saying yes if the satisfaction

1143
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:10,240
that the hardware security is<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

1144
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:13,580
will not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be much better on the way you</font>

1145
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:16,609
described it is there any standards and

1146
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:19,370
other thing or lying which gives at the

1147
00:49:16,610 --> 00:49:21,770
moment at present in the ecosystem it

1148
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:23,630
and what country you live in I guess is

1149
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:25,430
one like that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know one person</font>

1150
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:27,560
superhero is another person's you know

1151
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:31,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">terrorist right but I say in the States</font>

1152
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:33,770
there's the trusted the trusted foundry

1153
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:36,980
program set up by the DoD and that

1154
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:39,560
foundry<font color="#E5E5E5"> that program</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is chip makers that</font>

1155
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:41,060
are only a basically complying with

1156
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:43,990
certain standards they're oftentimes

1157
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:47,089
domestic so if you're developing some

1158
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:49,848
weapon of actual weapon and it

1159
00:49:47,089 --> 00:49:51,769
quires chips you as a company are

1160
00:49:49,849 --> 00:49:53,989
required to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use this trusted foundry</font>

1161
00:49:51,769 --> 00:49:55,968
program according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the US</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> government</font>

1162
00:49:53,989 --> 00:49:58,339
and so in that sense you're giving a

1163
00:49:55,969 --> 00:49:59,539
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of a test ation to your in</font>

1164
00:49:58,339 --> 00:50:01,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">client</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at look we've only used</font>

1165
00:49:59,539 --> 00:50:03,440
pre-approved chips in our product and

1166
00:50:01,549 --> 00:50:06,259
that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> part that we've done there's</font>

1167
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:08,749
also fits 140 compliance as common

1168
00:50:06,259 --> 00:50:10,729
criteria as well as a date about whether

1169
00:50:08,749 --> 00:50:12,019
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not those programs are good or not I</font>

1170
00:50:10,729 --> 00:50:16,460
guess it's Lisa step in the right

1171
00:50:12,019 --> 00:50:21,109
direction yeah and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think also</font>

1172
00:50:16,460 --> 00:50:22,279
partnering with your local you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1173
00:50:21,109 --> 00:50:24,650
whoever works in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> foreign</font>

1174
00:50:22,279 --> 00:50:25,609
intelligence office etc and have some

1175
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:27,229
like hey what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font>

1176
00:50:25,609 --> 00:50:29,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">vendor because they seem to know a lot</font>

1177
00:50:27,229 --> 00:50:30,919
more than<font color="#CCCCCC"> we think they do they often</font>

1178
00:50:29,450 --> 00:50:45,348
yeah I think I got<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good Intel</font>

1179
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:46,759
Gary thanks anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah I was inferring</font>

1180
00:50:45,349 --> 00:50:49,339
that maybe there'd be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a similar program</font>

1181
00:50:46,759 --> 00:50:52,700
in the country<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you live in so if</font>

1182
00:50:49,339 --> 00:50:54,969
you were living say the UAE that they

1183
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:57,529
have a similar trusted foundry program

1184
00:50:54,969 --> 00:50:59,150
but yeah but you're right they do have a

1185
00:50:57,529 --> 00:51:00,950
that you're certainly not going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">middle grade ship shipped to you in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1188
00:51:04,039 --> 00:51:20,180
imagine this something out there no next

1189
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:24,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">question jerk so you were up talking</font>

1190
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:27,499
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> about lack of trust and supply</font>

1191
00:51:24,859 --> 00:51:28,940
chain now<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> countries like</font>

1192
00:51:27,499 --> 00:51:32,149
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. they've gone off to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Raleigh</font>

1193
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:34,579
and jetty and try to have sanctions

1194
00:51:32,150 --> 00:51:37,670
against them against using<font color="#E5E5E5"> Maureen's</font>

1196
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:43,910
the US similarly uh there's no rules in

1197
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:48,380
Australia as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well in India we've</font>

1198
00:51:43,910 --> 00:51:52,640
requested lobby to to share source code

1199
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:54,469
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a lab in I IFC in bangalore</font>

1200
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:56,450
that's where they've been studying

1201
00:51:54,469 --> 00:51:59,150
source code except I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font>

1202
00:51:56,450 --> 00:52:00,740
targeting country you know specific

1203
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:04,280
companies and specific countries

1204
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:08,140
makes any sense because these are while

1205
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:11,290
some of the you know vulnerabilities are

1206
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:14,930
deliberate others are not that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> true so</font>

1207
00:52:11,290 --> 00:52:17,270
for and and for military<font color="#E5E5E5"> great stuff you</font>

1208
00:52:14,930 --> 00:52:19,609
can have a trusted foundry you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1209
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:20,770
system what do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> do for something like</font>

1210
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:24,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know the networking infrastructure</font>

1211
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:27,650
that your telecom companies use how do

1212
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:29,170
you ensure that that isn't one herbal

1213
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:32,720
what kind of programs kind of government

1214
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:36,560
you know roll out to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to improve the</font>

1215
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:41,209
security in that area a great question

1216
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:42,710
that's why you're all here you won't be

1217
00:52:41,210 --> 00:52:45,080
replaced by robots let's put it that way

1218
00:52:42,710 --> 00:52:47,119
so it's great questions it's difficult

1219
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:48,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem to solve and that's a you know</font>

1220
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:50,540
the flight obviously hardware security

1221
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:52,570
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not new but it these are the</font>

1222
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:54,770
questions that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all be</font>

1223
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:57,590
contemplating and figuring<font color="#CCCCCC"> out programs</font>

1224
00:52:54,770 --> 00:53:00,230
and approaches to help secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> the rest</font>

1225
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:01,520
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the plot of the system you know</font>

1226
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:04,010
we can't just be writing secure code

1227
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:07,820
that's been sitting on chips with been

1228
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:11,510
back door that's factory good stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

1229
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:15,459
yeah Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You fati Joshua thanks a lot</font>
