[Music]

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,040
the panel

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,560
that we have which is cyber physical

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,160
uh systems we have seen a rapid

5
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,439
emergence of technology getting inter

6
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,240
uh integrated with uh various cyber

7
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,400
physical systems and amazing security

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,519
hacks breach

9
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:34,559
etc have been uh noticed uh

10
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,200
in the few past recent years and months

11
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,800
for example the recent

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,760
florida water poisoning and the recent

13
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,360
report by which

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,320
i think it was by recording future where

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,360
there was a power

16
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,680
outage blackout in mumbai which is

17
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,640
claimed to be

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,079
uh done by the chinese uh so yeah

19
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,800
to set the context for the uh panel uh

20
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,760
let me say

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,440
some stats uh a motivated advisory

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,640
can capsize a cargo ship by hacking into

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,519
its ballast

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,479
pump controls and causing them to sink

25
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,880
this was well written and documented

26
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,320
by uh pen tester partners uh from the uk

27
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,720
uh they have also put this across on a

28
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:17,520
blog post

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,040
i will share the link later if you guys

30
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,360
are interested to read on it

31
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,799
also a remote hacker uh sitting away

32
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,640
100 meters could send unauthenticated

33
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,280
commands

34
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,840
over bluetooth to target a military

35
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,560
drone

36
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,000
to perform any malicious shares task

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,840
i'm told that the control software to

38
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,680
run a military class drone

39
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,119
is almost 3.5 million lines of code

40
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,560
while a boeing aircraft 787 is 6.5 lines

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,200
of code

42
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,240
that's a lot of programming uh

43
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,840
also forbes reported about researchers

44
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,960
who prepared

45
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,920
uh an exploit code and remo and radio

46
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,799
hardware

47
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,960
uh that took control of a construction

48
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,840
crane

49
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,200
uh scrapers and large machineries

50
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,560
so we all think okay uh uh

51
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,360
hacking is only done on hardware

52
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,599
infrastructure but also in our uh

53
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,560
in construction industry according to

54
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,760
wired magazine

55
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,560
the advent of sophisticated cloud

56
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,520
connected

57
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,480
infotainment systems the car software is

58
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,360
a modern

59
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,160
vehicle apparently uses 100 lines of

60
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:28,640
code

61
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,519
and we've all seen the jeep hack uh

62
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:32,560
which has happened

63
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,239
uh in 2015 so yes we've put together

64
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,800
an amazing panel of thought leaders who

65
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,680
would discuss

66
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,800
various domains uh and how the

67
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,800
cyber physical systems uh are

68
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,840
dealing with challenges uh our let me

69
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,360
introduce our panelist

70
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,840
uh frank sanjay he's from eaton

71
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,959
corporation

72
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,239
kushwan pavar from etas automotive

73
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,080
major mehta from pepsico and dr farooq

74
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:02,720
qazi

75
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,760
from vgit mumbai university so i would

76
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,080
let

77
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,440
uh request our panelist uh to start

78
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,640
their discussion and uh frank to

79
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,519
moderate

80
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,959
the panel hey thank you anthrax

81
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,840
awesome thanks for the introductions and

82
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,599
thank you for setting the context

83
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,280
and by the way it's not 100 lines of

84
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,879
code it's 100 million lines of 100

85
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,519
million

86
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,440
my bad yes so it's it's really amazing

87
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:29,760
to

88
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,640
see that the lines of code that in a car

89
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:32,959
are

90
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,200
almost like at least if not four times

91
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,159
at least three

92
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,560
three times more than on microsoft xp or

93
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,760
2000 so

94
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,400
it was startling when i actually came to

95
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,400
understand a complexity that goes into

96
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,080
building these cyber physical systems

97
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,400
thank you so much thanks and i'm really

98
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,200
excited

uh this uh automotives are a complex

127
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:48,800
software

128
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,880
and cyber physical system right a lot of

129
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,639
times when we bring the discussion about

130
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,240
cyber physical systems automotives are

131
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,280
left behind

132
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,919
and i am really excited to have a

different perspective

134
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,960
of bringing the automotives into cyber

135
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,120
physical space and we are really honored

so thank you um thank you antarix

165
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,880
and welcome to all my panelists uh

166
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,919
so before we go into this topic of cyber

167
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,880
physical systems

168
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,319
i think it's very important to

169
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,800
understand this um this concept right uh

170
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,919
a lot of times there's a lot of

171
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,560
confusion or a lack of clarity

172
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,720
about the term uh there are multiple

173
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,680
terms that go

174
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,840
with the this aspect of cyber physical

175
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,759
systems to begin the panel

176
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,240
i would like to invite dr farooq uh to

177
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,080
give us a brief

178
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,240
uh overview of what the cyber physical

179
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,520
systems mean

180
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,160
and how to understand this maybe uh

181
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,000
doctor farooq

182
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,160
yeah thank you thank you nalcon and

183
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,520
thank you frank for giving this

184
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,039
opportunity

185
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,080
so it's a cxo panel and in the cxo

186
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,039
people usually

187
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,039
run to the boardroom and i'm academician

188
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:50,880
so i'll run to the

189
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,520
whiteboard or blackboard now so just

190
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,960
give me one minute because i

191
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,120
i thought that i would give a proper

192
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,199
two-minute introduction to the cps and i

193
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,880
made some two three slides

194
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,800
so if i'm allowed if i'm having

195
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
permission to share the slides then i

196
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,080
think

197
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,919
i can properly explain the concept of

198
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,919
cyber physical system can i do that

199
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,160
sure please thank you thank you thank

200
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,319
you

201
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,120
so it's a small quick uh run through

202
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,039
what is cyber physical system

203
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,280
and i was actually amazed when i saw

204
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,759
this uh title from the nulcon cyber

205
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,440
physical system because this is

206
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,599
very typical term of academician or

207
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,520
research organization not much popular

208
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,639
in the industry

209
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,240
i was shocked actually when i saw that

210
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,160
the title is themed with cyber physical

211
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,840
systems so just give me two minutes and

212
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,479
i'll run through that

213
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,039
so as far as cps is concerned uh people

214
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,720
started using this term

215
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,360
from 2006 so it's a very recent

216
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,960
phenomena we can call

217
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,440
and this was mainly launched by nsf

218
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,599
national science foundation which funds

219
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,599
a lot of universities in the united

220
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,879
states

221
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,960
earlier people used to call cps by

222
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,319
different names they used to call as

223
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,479
cybernetics they used to call as uh

224
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,479
mechatronics and all those things

225
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:05,280
but right from 2006 ever since nsf came

226
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,879
in the picture with supporting some kind

227
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:07,919
of academia

228
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,919
for the research in this area suddenly

229
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,759
it get momentum and traction in the

230
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,000
academic circles

231
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,080
now from the name itself you can make

232
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,680
sense what exactly it is

233
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,240
so it's a cyber and physical system very

234
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,560
clear from the name terminology itself

235
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,800
so i will have at one hand a complex

236
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:25,759
physical system

237
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,240
combined with a sophisticated cyber

238
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,039
environment

239
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,520
which makes a cps and in case of cyber

240
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,519
environment we typically expect

241
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,760
control computing and communication

242
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,279
technologies to be present

243
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,360
and the physical for example if i talk

244
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,440
about smart grid kind of example

245
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,679
then i will have generation transmission

246
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,080
and distribution as part of my physical

247
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,920
so that's how people started looking at

248
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,920
it different people call this with the

249
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,000
technology of hybrid system network

250
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:52,640
system

251
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,480
machine machine communication sometimes

252
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,000
people also call this as

253
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,240
figital system so as to represent

254
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,920
physical and digital environment

255
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,880
together

256
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,839
and it manifests in manufacturing energy

257
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,760
transportation water network

258
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,080
almost everything is covered by the term

259
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,399
being called the cps

260
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,279
now there are two inter or overlapping

261
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,120
terms that people usually get confused

262
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,640
so cps and iot

263
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,640
these are more or less same there is no

264
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,640
point in discussing who is subset of

265
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,200
what

266
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,200
and another related term with the cps

267
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,320
which is very common

268
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,720
is called as industrial iot or iot or

269
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,040
industry 4.0 fourth industrial

270
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,160
revolution so just one more minute

271
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,839
typically the characteristic which

272
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,320
involve in case of cps is that they

273
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,440
inherently have

274
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,720
network control system they will be

275
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,880
obeying hybrid automata i think from

276
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,560
cyber security point of view this

277
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,000
becomes very critical

278
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,240
because in case of cyber physical system

279
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,160
the cyber environment evolves in a

280
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,120
discrete state

281
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,120
whereas physical environment evolves on

282
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,320
the continuous state

283
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,480
and when you look at a complete holistic

284
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,040
viewpoint this becomes a hybrid automata

285
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,120
kind of system and that actually poses

286
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,200
lot of challenges not just from academic

287
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,560
point of view but from the industry

288
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,000
point of view as well

289
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,480
and the last perspective is real time

290
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,640
computing and networking so these are

291
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,320
certain characteristics of the cyber

292
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,839
physical system

293
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,040
now you can actually start visualizing

294
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,480
cps

295
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,200
as good as a smallest device which can

296
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
be available like your

297
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,959
healthcare devices which collects your

298
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,800
biological data puts onto the cloud

299
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,399
computing environment and does some kind

300
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,440
of analytics

301
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,160
it can be a little bit complicated one

302
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,600
as a complete system

303
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,760
like a automobile or car in case of

304
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,680
mobility or connected car

305
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,720
or to the other extreme it can be

306
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,760
a complete system of system like a

307
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,480
smart grid or led a small city as such

308
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,760
so you can see the

309
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,079
span which which is covered by the cps

310
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:51,920
right from a smallest device

311
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,480
to the system to system of system and

312
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,240
typically i think all critical

313
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,200
infrastructure

314
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,839
fall under the category of the cps so i

315
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:00,959
thought that this

316
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,360
presentation i will share so that we

317
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,040
will have some

318
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,120
introductory ideas without taking much

319
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,160
of the time

320
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,640
now coming back to the cps i think one

321
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,760
of the area where

322
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,160
the academia is more focused nowadays is

323
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,800
about digital twin network control and

324
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,040
all those aspects so maybe as we proceed

325
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,200
further in our discussion and panel

326
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,519
discussion other topics i'll come back

327
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,279
back and forth to this areas so thank

328
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,200
you very much thank you dr farooq really

329
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,600
that's

330
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,079
that that gives a very good picture of

331
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,360
the uh the ubiquitous nature of cps

332
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,399
and uh this is really a good start uh i

333
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:38,000
think we have been hearing about this

334
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,680
word cyber physical systems or

335
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,800
industrial iot

336
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,720
and iot and ot critical infrastructure

337
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,480
very much as you rightly mentioned

338
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,240
within the conferences like this

339
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,440
but we have not heard as much about

340
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,440
a cyber physical system when it comes to

341
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,880
mobility side right

342
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,639
and uh the technology trends that are

343
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,240
taking up in the mobility side

344
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,639
so i would invite uh kushwan the next

345
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,760
panelist on the board

346
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,240
to kind of give a quick uh overview of

347
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,920
how the technology or when the key

348
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,519
technology trends that are coming and

349
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:08,399
affecting

350
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,639
the mobility side uh beat automotive

351
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:11,920
e-mobility

352
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,480
or uh electrification of the hydraulic

353
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,360
systems or

354
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,519
the electrification of flight but the

355
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,200
huge range of mobility sectors so maybe

356
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,160
a quick

357
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,839
quick introduction and around that

358
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,839
question

359
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,600
okay thanks frank and uh yeah you

360
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,560
already named some of those so ev

361
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,600
electrification

362
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,720
is yes a very big trend in automotive

363
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,920
as we experience uh electrification

364
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,000
is also coupled with a lot of

365
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,519
connectivity because

366
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,959
the electrical domain usually relies on

367
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,639
a lot of information of state of charge

368
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,480
of the batteries etc and how much would

369
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,519
be the range because the

370
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,880
analytics behind it is yet to be uh

371
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,600
formed the data needed for analytics is

372
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,040
still forming

373
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,880
so a lot of data is going back to the

374
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,120
cloud so connectivity is an important

375
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,560
aspect of electrification

376
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,399
and uh also from the telematics

377
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,600
perspective

378
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,000
a lot of shared mobility uh features are

379
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,720
being driven

380
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,920
the olas and ubers and zoom and bounce

381
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,200
and you name those

382
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,240
uh be it electric non-electric um

383
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,079
shared is becoming very popular

384
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,839
autonomous is picking up

385
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,320
and shared autonomous electric all of

386
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,480
them need connectivity so it's a classic

387
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,360
case

388
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,800
uh case um so connected autonomous

389
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,920
uh shared and uh electrified

390
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,800
so everything that uh manifests us in

391
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,320
terms of technology innovations

392
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,079
falls under either of these

393
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,000
characteristics

394
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,720
right right thank you so much i think uh

395
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,360
that's that

396
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,320
i think bringing automotive uh to to the

397
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,680
discussion when we are talking about the

398
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,199
security of cps

399
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:58,160
uh is is very important um maybe there

400
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,279
are also other

401
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,760
other uh areas like health pharma

402
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,880
manufacturing

403
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,839
uh which also have a lot of relationship

404
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:06,959
when it comes to

405
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,079
cyber physical systems and the

406
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,839
technology that are getting embedded

407
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,040
into these cyber

408
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,360
or cyber bringing the cyber into the

409
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,639
physical systems may

410
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:17,440
so i would now move on to uh mayur to

411
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,399
quickly introduce

412
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,240
how these industries like health uh

413
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,560
healthcare pharma manufacturing

414
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,920
um are getting impacted or getting

415
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,600
included into this big space of

416
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,320
cps and uh maybe the key drivers that

417
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,440
are driving this uh

418
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,360
transition of bringing in complex

419
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,440
technologies and embedding into

420
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,160
these uh physical systems hey over to

421
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,760
you um

422
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,639
yeah so can you hear me well yes i can

423
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:43,519
thank you thanks

424
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,680
uh first of all i would like to tell you

425
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,360
this uh what has happened just few

426
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,320
minutes ago

427
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,320
uh when i was entering this room my

428
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,839
office room actually in the home my

429
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,680
my daughter asked me where are you going

430
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,839
dressed up so i said i'm going to go out

431
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,120
let's go so um

432
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,680
i mean i'm amazed to see this uh forum

433
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,600
and then be uh very humble to be part of

434
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,399
this so

435
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,519
uh i mean thanks to dr farhook and our

436
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,120
colleagues to set up the context so

437
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,000
definitely

438
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,920
the cyber physical world or smart

439
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,839
manufacturing it would keep their in

440
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:14,800
this world

441
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,279
uh all across and then you touched upon

442
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,120
what is the impact on pharma

443
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,399
or manufacturing or or any other medical

444
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,160
fields which are actually linking not

445
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,560
just devices as such but they are

446
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,600
linking with human

447
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,839
and the society in general so i was

448
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:30,639
fortunate

449
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,959
enough to work in all the multiple

450
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,199
domains oil and gas pharma

451
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:38,399
manufacturing right now in fmcg so

452
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,639
the perspective of all these is actually

453
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,320
always this data modeling in the

454
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,959
pharmacies for example using aiml

455
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,120
it's it's it's speaking very heavy

456
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,560
because uh

457
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,639
just to give a context it takes 12 years

458
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,399
to bring in a new

459
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,199
medicine into the product in olden days

460
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:56,480
it's taking few years

461
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,560
uh now actually in the case of poverty

462
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,920
we have seen that it's

463
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,639
it's just one year so a lot of data

464
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,839
modulation

465
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,839
bringing these technologies is helping a

466
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,000
lot the scientists to the manufacturing

467
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,360
guys and all that

468
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,360
um i have been hearing a lot of about

469
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,440
remote commissioning uh and believe me

470
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,079
it's

471
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,000
heavy challenging because commissioning

472
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,240
is you know its own

473
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,160
gigantic work actually in itself

474
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,079
basically so remote commissioning

475
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,560
bringing in new cameras or thermal

476
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,519
cameras

477
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,839
um and integrated sliding basically

478
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:28,560
because now

479
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,959
uh from the procurement of raw material

480
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:32,320
to the final good products

481
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,160
everything is connected and we want to

482
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,000
have a digital twin

483
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,720
business visualization of the plan um

484
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,480
removing that

485
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,320
obstacles which previously used to be

486
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,079
the air gapping things and all that that

487
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:44,399
is

488
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,440
going away because of all these stuff

489
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,040
predictive maintenance is one of the

490
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,800
most critical look after

491
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,079
uh area digitalization it comes under

492
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:54,959
release like

493
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,199
jason and most of the companies who are

494
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,440
always focusing on b2b model business

495
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,399
business model now

496
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,320
going to the business to see a business

497
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,440
consumer model

498
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,359
and that is driving a lot of automation

499
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,439
and this uh or the

500
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,160
capturing of these technologies um in

501
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,240
actual world real world basically

502
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,160
and then these are actually uh some of

503
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,640
the faster adoption i could see

504
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,640
using the id services in the ot

505
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,919
environment so

506
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,400
i mean there are a lot of areas where

507
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,520
not just the in theory or in the concept

508
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,199
we are actually seeing the real

509
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,720
implementation

510
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,679
wow that looks like um i mean you guys

511
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,440
are bringing in technologies

512
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,960
uh probably much faster than the

513
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,120
software world in some senses right

514
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,600
uh the the latest technologies that are

515
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,160
that we

516
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,640
hear about uh in the software world are

517
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,480
quickly getting integrated into these

518
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,600
physical systems

519
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,200
which in the previous times were

520
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,880
considered like separate there was a

521
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,080
firewall there's like

522
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:53,120
it's an unknown critical system and uh

523
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,039
probably it's not really affected by

524
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,240
cyber risks

525
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,840
but looks like there are so many

526
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,600
technologies that are getting embedded

527
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,240
into

528
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,640
uh this entire cyber physical system

529
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,600
space

530
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,640
and each technology with it brings a lot

531
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,600
of risks

532
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,960
so maybe i will ask you to expand upon a

533
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,960
little bit on the kind of risks that

534
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,760
are kind of coming and affecting uh this

535
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,679
transition or this uh rapid

536
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,799
transformation

537
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:21,919
uh that is coming into this space

538
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,200
okay so yeah yeah so

539
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,200
definitely i mean i mean i think this

540
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,960
was a dialogue in uh

541
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,520
uh one of the movie that uh with power

542
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,520
stewards with the responsibility i think

543
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:33,919
these

544
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,480
different technologies also bring in a

545
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,080
lot of capability but they bring

546
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,520
security issues as well

547
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,440
right so there is no doubt in that and

548
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,679
and what are those challenges so always

549
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,919
uh i mean uh till i think uh

550
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,160
2017 uh people were thinking when we

551
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:53,360
have isc 95 which talks about uh mixing

552
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,320
up the ot

553
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,160
which used to be just the physical world

554
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,679
with the id or the

555
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,640
the integration of that um will bring in

556
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,240
a lot of security challenges right so

557
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,760
that that has been dealt with i

558
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:05,840
say 996 standard like we'll talk about

559
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,960
that but basically that was the one

560
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,720
we looked at now we are looking at the

561
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,160
other pieces ot

562
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,400
ot integration which is trusted ot

563
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,160
network to the untrusted

564
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,559
networks so that brings all together

565
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:19,679
complete new

566
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,600
uh understanding of how do you deal with

567
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,520
that and then we have seen

568
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,000
id services by default getting

569
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,440
integrated to the ot

570
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,440
and in many space secure way many

571
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,200
unsecured way which leads to some

572
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,880
attacks like wannacry we have seen that

573
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,280
actually

574
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,640
in most of the companies um and then

575
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,640
that has not just on paper it is

576
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,200
actually calling causing 300 400

577
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,280
millions in a few hours basically right

578
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,960
so there are impacts

579
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,960
to the companies and that is huge

580
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,440
actually and that's why the

581
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,960
the reason we have all these uh the ot

582
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,320
folks coming into the

583
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,880
leadership forums and and to the top so

584
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,360
that

585
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,360
from the beginning management understand

586
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,120
this impact it's not just

587
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,200
cyber impact on uncertainty it's an

588
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,960
overall impact basically

589
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,919
and and also these technologies um

590
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,760
rather than bringing some

591
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,400
feeding mac as a mechanism to have right

592
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,200
controls

593
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,919
we are still lagging a lot in that area

594
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,039
so i would say

595
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,120
uh they bring is lot of graphs lot of

596
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,679
charts we see iot devices coming in the

597
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,559
main the data

598
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,200
shows the data what else i mean already

599
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,799
this plant manager guys

600
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,640
you can believe me have enough data to

601
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,120
see you need to have

602
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,520
possibility to take actions and and on

603
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,120
the quick movements basically so there

604
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:35,679
are

605
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,720
areas i can keep talking about that

606
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,559
i know i think yesterday when we

607
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:42,880
connected we really said that this this

608
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,200
field is so enormous that it in itself

609
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,720
can have its own conference

610
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,159
and we can keep talking about the risks

611
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,840
but yeah let me move uh

612
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,559
to dr faro can just quickly understand

613
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,760
the perspective from civil

614
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,039
infrastructure right one is the

615
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,320
industries having

616
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,760
bringing in technology and that

617
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,080
technology adding a lot of risks into

618
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:00,880
the mix

619
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,080
but how is this coming or manifesting in

620
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,840
the area of civil infrastructure or

621
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,360
critical infrastructure

622
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,760
where it can affect the public life uh

623
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,679
anthrax example of florida water

624
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:12,400
poisoning right

625
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,320
increasing story it could really have

626
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,000
real life impact affecting the

627
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,960
life of people so dr kaz dr faro could

628
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,520
you

629
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,679
briefly touch upon the risks that that

630
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,000
are possible or that you are seeing in

631
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,240
reality uh when it comes to civil life

632
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,559
of people

633
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,039
because of the risks yes sure so i would

634
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:33,200
like to take ahead

635
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,320
uh the line uh what mayor said about it

636
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,280
and ot

637
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,679
uh typically the industry perception is

638
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,360
that they are air gapped but we know

639
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,159
very well that

640
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,799
such kind of air gap does not exist

641
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,159
anymore now

642
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,799
uh one major challenge for civil

643
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:49,600
infrastructure

644
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,880
as well as for critical infrastructure

645
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,200
particularly based upon my understanding

646
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,120
being in various committees inquiring

647
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,960
various different type of incidences

648
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,559
is that this critical infrastructure or

649
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:03,679
ot environment

650
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:07,200
is developed over years with legacy

651
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,960
protocols with legacy

652
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,679
devices and that poses a lot of

653
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:13,840
challenge when we try to actually layer

654
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,360
it by the cyber

655
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,440
environment on top of that so when you

656
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,320
talk about it plus ot integration

657
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,320
quite often in an attempt of

658
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,679
modernization or

659
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,640
digitization we forget that our physical

660
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,039
world

661
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,280
is having certain kind of restrictions

662
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,840
so my rtu for example which is used in

663
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,200
case of power grid

664
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,240
may not have ability to talk to uh

665
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,039
the high bandwidth devices as it is

666
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,159
expected to

667
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,080
secondly in my it environment the

668
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,840
firewall which is installed

669
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,480
may not understand ot protocols so

670
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,240
essentially this firewall

671
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,840
is useless because i can only understand

672
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,840
very few protocols and the rest of the

673
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,520
protocols which are proprietary in

674
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,200
nature in the ot environment

675
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,520
are missed as far security is concerned

676
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,960
so there are a lot of

677
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,640
mismatches which are available between

678
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,880
this it and ot and they pose a lot of

679
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,440
challenge

680
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,039
so if i want to talk about the most

681
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,559
important thing in my viewpoint

682
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,240
obviously there can be different others

683
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,039
as well

684
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:13,120
one biggest thing that i always seen is

685
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,799
a patch management that becomes

686
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,200
really really really very tough in case

687
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,880
of cyber physical system because

688
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,799
this systems are live and you cannot

689
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,480
have every tuesday

690
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,480
in a month or a week or whatever for

691
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,240
patch management because downtime is

692
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,919
very costly in case of

693
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,120
cyber physical or critical

694
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,039
infrastructure the second thing that i

695
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:31,919
have seen is

696
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,159
these devices the endpoint devices are

697
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:34,960
always having

698
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,120
very less amount of bandwidth capability

699
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,360
and computation capability as well

700
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,600
the third and most important is for

701
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,799
example

702
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:46,400
the isc 61850 there is one protocol

703
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,559
but different vendor will interpret this

704
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,159
protocol in a

705
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,960
wide different varieties so there is a

706
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,159
lot of

707
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:55,440
regulatory issues a lot of

708
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,600
interoperability issues these are all

709
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,240
posing the challenges in terms of the

710
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,200
cyber security in terms of cps i can say

711
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,279
wow thank you thank you dr kazi i think

712
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,279
you really put it in a very succinct

713
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,159
manner thank

714
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,320
you so much now let us move to the other

715
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,279
other area which

716
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,360
uh is representing the mobility side

717
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,320
right so

718
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,480
when you can quickly touch upon what are

719
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,000
the key cyber risks

720
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,159
uh when it comes to mobility space right

721
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,640
you understand the mobility space

722
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,080
so uh the acknowledgement of cia has

723
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:26,400
come

724
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,799
very recently to automotive so it was

725
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,720
recovery after

726
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,840
thinking about top structures for life

727
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,760
the organizations have to move to

728
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,919
thinking in terms of defense in depth

729
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,080
um and also as dr farooq mentioned

730
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,080
one is yes the embedded devices have

731
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,200
very very

732
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,880
less bandwidth they have less computing

733
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,400
capacities now what are the risks that

734
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:48,880
we see

735
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,240
occasionally is uh there are several

736
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,520
variants that come up

737
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,760
in all of this uh embedded devices

738
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,799
automotive mode

739
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,559
for example any particular model may

740
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,840
have anything between five to ten

741
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:00,720
variants

742
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,200
and they will be based on more on the

743
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,559
same software stack with minor

744
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,760
differences

745
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,320
now every time you are creating a

746
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,840
heterogeneous security

747
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,120
for these variant management

748
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,440
or security variant management is one

749
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,320
big uh

750
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,880
problem that uh or a risk because there

751
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,440
is

752
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,080
always this uh possibility of missing

753
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,840
out on vulnerability

754
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,760
of um any changes that they have been

755
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,760
done so back back tracing

756
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,400
the uh vulnerabilities and identifying

757
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,279
the source

758
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,520
there is far less time to really take

759
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,559
these kind of uh

760
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,799
steps especially if you have reached the

761
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,159
sop

762
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,720
start of production in in automotive a

763
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,760
second point that

764
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,640
i would want to mention just uh in a

765
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,320
minute is

766
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,520
the the plant to the

767
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,559
back end connectivity still is id but

768
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:53,520
when the people

769
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,760
are in field and they have to upgrade

770
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,440
their credentials or you know simple

771
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,279
things like

772
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,320
renewing a certificate you know it's a

773
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:02,960
big

774
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,559
big big challenge for the automotive

775
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,880
dealership networks now you are

776
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,000
definitely run a risk

777
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,320
of uh having insecure networks at the

778
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,279
dealerships

779
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,760
you definitely run a possibility of

780
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,039
multiple vendors

781
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,799
who would be having all of these

782
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,039
inheritance risks typical i.t

783
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:23,440
inheritance i'm talking about which can

784
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,799
just

785
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,000
end up in um in in situations

786
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,520
of introducing vulnerabilities in the

787
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,120
vehicles so these are

788
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,640
two major risks that i see from the

789
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,480
supplier and the ecosystem side

790
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,919
and the other one is the technical

791
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:38,080
challenges that pose because of the

792
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,520
limitations of the system and the

793
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,400
variants

794
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,200
that automotive sees right so that's a

795
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,559
very interesting point i mean

796
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,919
uh variation brings in uh the management

797
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,159
challenge to manage the security aspect

798
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,159
but at the same time standardization

799
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,400
brings in familiarity right uh

800
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,919
probably you might want to run your

801
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,600
cluster on a linux based

802
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,720
system and uh that linux based system is

803
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,039
now

804
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,279
known very well a very well established

805
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:04,480
uh platform for

806
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,000
all the attackers and probably that's

807
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,679
the transition and that's the challenge

808
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:08,720
that you guys have

809
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,360
uh to balance between standardization

810
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,200
and managing the variation uh

811
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,000
between the platforms yes

812
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,360
so in terms of uh regulations automotive

813
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,840
has the least amount of uh regulations

814
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,120
for cyber security

815
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,559
uh okay and uh

816
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,559
honestly what has come up is the unece

817
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,120
wp29 which is one of the first releases

818
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,200
and iso 21434

819
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,919
all of this tells you what to do but

820
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:38,720
honestly

821
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,679
nobody tells you how to really achieve

822
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,200
those

823
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,240
those measures and of course it's up to

824
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,679
the communities like this to really

825
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:48,000
figure

826
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,919
out what is the best way fastest way to

827
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,039
reach the

828
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,799
regulatory objectives compliances and

829
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,520
regulatory requirements okay hey thank

830
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,039
you um

831
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,240
i think you brought in a very good

832
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,480
perspective to this discussion

833
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,840
uh one is i mean we have been discussing

834
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,919
about all the challenges but uh i think

835
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:06,799
the response

836
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,880
right what is that what are the kinds of

837
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,640
responses that we are seeing so let us

838
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,279
hear out

839
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,600
from the panel uh in your own fields

840
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,360
like what is happening when it comes to

841
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,279
responses how the customers

842
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,440
like asset owners like mayur is

843
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,480
responding

844
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,000
and uh what are the things that

845
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,240
suppliers like kushwanta who are

846
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,120
producing secure uh stacks and secure

847
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,279
development platforms for the oems oem's

848
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,000
entire

849
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,640
tier manufacturers and regulators so

850
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,480
i'll start with um

851
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,360
hey mayor can you give us a quick intro

852
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,640
or a peek into

853
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,240
how the industries are responding to

854
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,159
this challenge it's a really big an

855
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,760
enormous challenge and

856
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,000
it probably needs to be very coordinated

857
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,840
and collaborative in nature so

858
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,679
maybe you can give us a quick peek into

859
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,039
how the industries are responding to the

860
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,440
cybersecurity challenge

861
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,600
uh yeah this is a very interesting uh

862
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,640
topic

863
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,120
and it

864
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,159
the peak was not that high but then this

865
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,080
is right now so this is also depending

866
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,919
on that basically so that time people

867
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:13,679
are actually getting engaged okay let's

868
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,360
do the assessment of your plans

869
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,120
let's try to understand the security

870
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,279
posture and then see where are the gaps

871
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,360
but they have understood a lot of areas

872
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,440
because to be very honest you talk about

873
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,480
any industry

874
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,720
down the layer below four which is party

875
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,520
model

876
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,600
uh everything is actually not secure i

877
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,799
mean though we call it the

878
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,159
network it's full of xps windows 2000

879
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,240
all sort of possible network you can

880
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,200
think of in your

881
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,360
imagination i have been to many sites

882
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,200
which were actually built before you and

883
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,320
i wanted

884
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,559
so those sites are running and they are

885
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:45,600
producing millions

886
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,720
uh every day right so definitely there

887
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,720
is no way we we gonna

888
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,520
remove those sites or network basically

889
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,399
so what are the

890
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,720
opportunities uh i cannot talk about the

891
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,679
specifically on

892
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,360
my company perspective but in general

893
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,960
because i have been part of these

894
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,760
in many areas companies are running

895
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,120
security programs

896
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,520
when i say program is to enhance the

897
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,760
security of manufacturing sites supply

898
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,520
chain plants everywhere

899
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,440
and that are given in the cso

900
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,679
organization and actually enterprise

901
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:16,720
architecture

902
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,440
the ot network security everything works

903
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,240
hand in hand

904
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,399
to see the opportunities to secure and

905
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:23,760
as he was mentioning

906
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,440
the tax management being one of the

907
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,600
difficult parts all these services path

908
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,120
management anti-virus

909
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,600
uh security monitoring in the planned

910
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,720
area because that is

911
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,240
one of the very touchy point for some of

912
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,520
the manufacturing guys

913
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,320
uh recovery these are the areas which

914
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,840
are looked at from the free point of

915
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,159
view

916
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,840
these services are always there in it

917
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,520
but now they are from the

918
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,159
point of view how we can take a standard

919
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,159
consideration there are vendors coming

920
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:50,640
up

921
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,720
uh ot has provided this security

922
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,640
services i cannot name them but there

923
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,679
are other services

924
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,080
provided uh by vendors which are coming

925
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,000
in these fields specifically

926
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,799
uh and then we also see like what are

927
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:03,440
the

928
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,360
possibility to enhance the networks

929
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,600
because these networks are also legacy

930
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,519
then if you want to bring in new

931
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,760
security capabilities in these networks

932
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:13,039
i'm not talking about the layers below

933
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:13,760
which starts

934
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,600
for the pure manufacturing but because

935
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,279
this thread is outside

936
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,760
coming in outside network those need to

937
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,559
be secure so

938
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,039
those enhancements enhancement basically

939
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,080
are the main

940
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,519
uh things driver driving factors and you

941
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,919
are talking about iot right so iot it's

942
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:32,240
on has its own network or the flow of

943
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,360
architecture which

944
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,200
starting from the sensor to the gateway

945
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,360
to the your

946
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,519
transport mechanism to the either

947
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:40,640
central servers

948
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,279
or in the data centers or the cloud all

949
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,559
that need to be built in

950
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,640
from the security point of view so

951
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,960
industries understand and that's why

952
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,679
uh guys like us being part of their core

953
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:52,640
communities and

954
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,720
and actually very heavily engaged in

955
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,320
these kind of development models

956
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,360
basically which

957
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,440
which is trying to respond rather than

958
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,600
um rather than actually be

959
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,679
from the initial days because uh as i

960
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:05,200
mentioned this is growing over the

961
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,640
period of time because

962
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,600
uh every year uh it is changing uh the

963
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,120
security posture and the

964
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,640
threats and that's why 2016 assessment

965
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,279
time

966
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,720
most of the companies were in assessment

967
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,200
time now they're in enhancement times

968
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,039
development times all that things is

969
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:22,640
happening

970
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,760
right thank you uh thank you

971
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,600
a lot of times customers might not

972
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,880
really know

973
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,640
i think if they are educated about cyber

974
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,559
security aware of cyber security then

975
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:33,200
yes

976
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,760
but in some cases people might not

977
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,519
really know the kind of risks that they

978
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:37,760
are

979
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:39,600
actually dealing with and millions of

980
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,640
dollars are being produced

981
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,320
and millions of people are relying on

982
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,919
the product that these particular

983
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,880
companies are making or civil lives are

984
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,080
probably at stake

985
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,840
uh if proper security is not implemented

986
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,720
so i will move on to dr faro to just see

987
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,240
what are the regulators or i mean what

988
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,760
is the regulatory space looking like are

989
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,120
the governments doing something about

990
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:01,919
this or

991
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,480
um how is that looking uh beat

992
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,399
internationally and locally at indian

993
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,000
government level so maybe dr

994
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,679
faro you can throw a little bit light on

995
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,360
that yes

996
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,679
sure sure so as far as india is

997
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,279
concerned we are having uh

998
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,600
two regulators mainly who are addressing

999
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,679
uh cyber security eventualities in the

1000
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:21,279
cyber physical system

1001
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,360
one as we everybody knows that certain

1002
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,240
is one regulator who actually

1003
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,880
manages the indian cyberspace the second

1004
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,480
one typically

1005
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,799
which is used in case of this cyber

1006
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:34,799
physical system

1007
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:38,000
is nci ipc national critical information

1008
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,519
infrastructure protection center which

1009
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,159
is having mandate of

1010
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,880
looking at the cyber security aspect of

1011
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,399
critical infrastructure which also

1012
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,399
involves energy which involves

1013
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,559
oil and gas petrochemical refineries

1014
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:51,919
banking and finance and all those

1015
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:53,360
critical infrastructure

1016
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,840
so from indian point of view these are

1017
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,120
two major bodies but

1018
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,120
if you talk about the energy sector

1019
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,399
particularly

1020
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:03,120
then there are certain transmission cert

1021
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,000
distribution

1022
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,880
cert generation so domain specific certs

1023
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,919
are also available

1024
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,000
uh with respect to the energy sector

1025
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,119
particularly

1026
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,119
uh globally if you talk about then there

1027
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:14,800
are a lot of bodies lot of bodies in the

1028
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,359
sense

1029
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:18,639
nist is there which talks about how to

1030
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,359
regulate

1031
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,399
uh particularly this particular cyber

1032
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:23,440
physical environment

1033
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,280
the another one which i think everybody

1034
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,839
must be well aware about is nuxif

1035
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:30,000
which talks typically for bulk energy

1036
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:30,879
systems

1037
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,639
and there are many more which are there

1038
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,639
specific to europe and specific to

1039
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,520
middle east

1040
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,359
countries as well like qatar is having

1041
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:38,960
their own cert and

1042
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,639
there are many other regulatory bodies

1043
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,560
which are established either from the

1044
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,280
industry

1045
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,839
organizations or from the government

1046
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,839
bodies as such so a lot of

1047
00:34:47,839 --> 00:34:50,399
regulatory efforts are happening uh in

1048
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:51,040
terms of

1049
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,599
uh the cyber physical system of critical

1050
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,639
infrastructure

1051
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:56,639
standardization is also being taken care

1052
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,680
by uh

1053
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,359
iso iec isa and there are a few more

1054
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:02,000
ieee

1055
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,400
bodies which are there which are giving

1056
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,240
out standards for different type of

1057
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,400
uh aspect of the cyber security for

1058
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,920
example

1059
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,880
uh this is 62443 is there which looks

1060
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,839
into this

1061
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,320
so 27 000 is there so there are a lot of

1062
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,240
standardization bodies as well

1063
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,640
which are trying to contribute towards

1064
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,920
making the cps as secure as possible

1065
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,960
thank you thank you dr kazi how about i

1066
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,480
mean what is the space looking like when

1067
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,800
it comes to mobility um you mentioned

1068
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,320
that there are not it's it's probably

1069
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:32,640
not

1070
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,720
not yet so regulated but what is what

1071
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,440
are you observing there

1072
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,800
so mainly it is coming from um

1073
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,400
so one of the earlier drivers was let's

1074
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,560
say gdpr and then the supplier suddenly

1075
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,760
started gearing up for

1076
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,839
gdpr the reason is it was the first time

1077
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:49,200
that the user data

1078
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,200
from the vehicles was being uh

1079
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,440
considered to be sent to back end

1080
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,520
so that it can be used for analytics and

1081
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,200
predictive maintenance and diagnostics

1082
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,000
etc

1083
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,680
but it had a lot of purple identifiable

1084
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,680
information so they started taking

1085
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,800
gdpr uh as first and over the period of

1086
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,119
time wp29 has come up

1087
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,320
so at least in europe japan korea the

1088
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,960
oems and suppliers are supposed to

1089
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,200
comply to certain set of requirements

1090
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:18,000
uh this means what that the oens are

1091
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:18,880
going to push

1092
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,960
a lot of security requirements to their

1093
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,920
suppliers

1094
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,880
so uh suppliers like bosch eaton um i

1095
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,000
don't know several

1096
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,880
others have already been gearing up for

1097
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,560
their platform products their

1098
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,280
uh really very important products uh

1099
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,040
transform the hardware because it starts

1100
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,720
from hardware when you start with cyber

1101
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,320
physical system security

1102
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,160
and started looking at you know

1103
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,240
modularization of the stacks uh trying

1104
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,720
to build in as many standard algorithms

1105
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,920
uh established algorithms uh uh for

1106
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,800
crypto function

1107
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,960
functionalities and uh without

1108
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,560
experimenting too much

1109
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,640
or spending on new fancy algorithms they

1110
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,480
have relied on standard technology

1111
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,440
so that they could be further used in

1112
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,880
harmonization of the

1113
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,599
platform security uh uh platform

1114
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,320
security

1115
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,520
uh concepts so with this in in view i

1116
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,000
see

1117
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,480
a lot of suppliers already have their

1118
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,280
set of

1119
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,280
um security standard operating

1120
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:15,280
procedures uh security engineering

1121
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,240
processes have been

1122
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,960
implemented already and it will just be

1123
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,240
a

1124
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,560
they have a minor steps uh to be taken

1125
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,160
to really be compliant to the

1126
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,560
uh regulation on the contrary oems have

1127
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,240
little more to do

1128
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,760
that's what i very often see okay

1129
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,000
yeah thank you i think that's a that's a

1130
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:35,280
really good

1131
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:38,640
thing but how as a let's say as a c

1132
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,000
a a c level executive right or a person

1133
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,160
being made responsible uh like in in

1134
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,200
case of mayur

1135
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,119
or anybody who is responsible for the

1136
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:49,359
procurement of the systems that you are

1137
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:51,359
bringing into your company to run either

1138
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:52,640
it's a data center

1139
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:55,680
because data center runs on the power

1140
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,599
infrastructure which again is a cps

1141
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,040
right kind of a cps with

1142
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,240
probably maybe small c not a captaincy

1143
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,640
but

1144
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,119
a small level of cyber is there when it

1145
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,480
comes to power infrastructure that is

1146
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:06,960
running

1147
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,920
your data centers so how i mean are

1148
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,520
there any emerging standards and

1149
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,720
certifications

1150
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,240
um which can tell when which we can ask

1151
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,880
our suppliers or uh which the the

1152
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,160
companies that are

1153
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,800
procuring can ask hey are you complying

1154
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,280
to this

1155
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,200
are your processes running at this level

1156
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,040
of security uh what other

1157
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,800
assurances what is that landscape

1158
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,880
looking like

1159
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,599
yeah so um as i said this is a journey

1160
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:34,320
right so

1161
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,480
uh the good part about president

1162
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,560
movement is we do not have any kind of a

1163
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,640
government regulations which are forcing

1164
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,320
us to go through this

1165
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,839
and that is a big game changer the

1166
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:45,359
reason is

1167
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,040
these certification bodies are also

1168
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,400
needed first thing and secondly the

1169
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,160
govern government's bodies who are

1170
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,520
actually regulating us on

1171
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,760
certain processes which we are driving

1172
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,720
for our

1173
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,680
business basically so fda drives for

1174
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,320
food and

1175
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,400
and pharma and then similarly we have

1176
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,359
other regulation

1177
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:04,720
uh bodies who gives us clear indicates

1178
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,160
what are the regulations we need to

1179
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:06,640
follow

1180
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,800
but in terms of security space basically

1181
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,480
we are still living with the standard

1182
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:10,720
and

1183
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,880
standard and regulation two things are

1184
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,560
different right

1185
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,560
follow the standard nobody can mend it

1186
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,480
us but regulation is something different

1187
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:19,200
and that

1188
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,160
linking is still uh happening and as

1189
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,680
that's why i said we are lucky because

1190
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,640
most of the people cannot apply that

1191
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,320
very rapidly but

1192
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,400
the programs are understanding that when

1193
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,480
we see there is no silver bullet for the

1194
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,040
uh any problems which we are seeing so

1195
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:35,680
defense

1196
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,560
uh in depth is one of the key space and

1197
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:39,520
all your

1198
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,200
uh products which you are buying you

1199
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,720
talked about some of the component data

1200
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,320
centers you talk about component in the

1201
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,400
manufacture right so even those

1202
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,359
need to be uh security compliance with

1203
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,440
the security features with

1204
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,079
a capability to withstand the denial of

1205
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:55,359
service attacks the

1206
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,119
communication robustness we talk about

1207
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,480
right so all that

1208
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,720
kind of uh things we can actually ask

1209
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:02,320
but how do you ask that

1210
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,560
so there are certifications available at

1211
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,480
the product level like system level

1212
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,000
at the manufacturing plant level

1213
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,760
basically

1214
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,280
just to give some of the examples

1215
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,200
basically uh six to four

1216
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,319
three four or two dash which is also um

1217
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,800
satisfying the product basically and uh

1218
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,240
um and 3.3

1219
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:22,560
uh specifically that says how do you

1220
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,480
certify your system basically

1221
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,319
and there are many governance body there

1222
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:28,079
are many companies who are driving these

1223
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:28,640
standards

1224
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,880
for products and systems across the

1225
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,000
globe

1226
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,160
and then and they are certifying this

1227
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,560
but again as i said this this is a

1228
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,960
challenge of adoption which is a good

1229
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,240
piece at the moment because we are

1230
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,119
maturing from

1231
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:44,319
stage one to three uh and so on and

1232
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:46,000
uh the key part is the how do you

1233
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,680
certify your people basically because

1234
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,720
it's not about just

1235
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,599
that it's the people who run the whole

1236
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:52,000
system

1237
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,119
so there are standards certification

1238
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:55,920
coming in that

1239
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:59,440
area as well in ot uh yeah

1240
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,599
thank you thank you mayor um i think we

1241
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,119
talked a lot about the

1242
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:04,800
technical part of it right product

1243
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,040
certification standardization standards

1244
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,160
and donations

1245
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,359
as as a leader right as a leader what

1246
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:12,079
are the key

1247
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:14,560
non-technical challenges that you that

1248
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,319
you are experiencing

1249
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,240
that might provide some insight into the

1250
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,400
other leaders to the other leaders who

1251
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,560
are on the on the forum and hearing us

1252
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,000
can you throw a little bit light into

1253
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,280
non-technical challenges that you are

1254
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,560
facing

1255
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,720
you see me laughing right so you can

1256
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,240
believe me i can give two days

1257
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,359
session on this so right

1258
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:36,319
so when we when we talk about it ot air

1259
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:36,960
gap

1260
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,280
uh which is not there as kaz mentioned

1261
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,880
uh mr kashi mentioned

1262
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,160
but the itot air gap on the knowledge

1263
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,800
piece is still there what i mean what i

1264
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,800
mean by that is when i go through

1265
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,119
a recruitment process for my engineers

1266
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,200
for my architects for my

1267
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,240
in any any organization i i receive 400

1268
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,839
cvs not even 5 percent

1269
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:00,640
are actually meeting that fund that's a

1270
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,000
big air gap i can

1271
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,640
see knowledge here the reason i would

1272
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,319
say i will not blame individuals the

1273
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,160
reason it is you are finding you are

1274
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,280
trying to find

1275
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,480
in one person uh ot domain knowledge

1276
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,599
which is itself is a ocean and knowledge

1277
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,040
in the security field

1278
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,200
and knowledge in iit networking speed in

1279
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,640
the single person or maybe

1280
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,640
in a team to fit this requirement

1281
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,800
basically so that's a

1282
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,280
big area of concern which which is

1283
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,640
something not

1284
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,800
readily available and then you try to

1285
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,319
say okay i go there and

1286
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,599
there are things we need to build

1287
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,240
actually uh and the language we speak

1288
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,480
so when somebody go to the shop floor

1289
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,520
they have a different

1290
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,440
jargons that they they use in the shop

1291
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,800
floor in terms of

1292
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,440
the running whole production there they

1293
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,240
have a

1294
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,880
plan they have what you call targets for

1295
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,760
the day

1296
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,880
not even day hours minutes and all that

1297
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,440
stuff

1298
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,400
iot talks different uh languages

1299
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,440
downtime

1300
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,680
uh link breakdown also there are a lot

1301
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,280
of languages various

1302
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,920
which actually gives lot of challenges

1303
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,560
because

1304
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:06,720
i t want to provide the services or they

1305
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,839
don't understand their language

1306
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:09,040
sometimes they don't even understand

1307
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:09,520
what is

1308
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,160
mean by food so they understand it is a

1309
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:12,800
physical

1310
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,200
but there are in port means the services

1311
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:15,839
right so

1312
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,920
a lot of language barriers basically and

1313
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,119
it is very hard

1314
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,640
to find it find a talent which has a

1315
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:25,200
passion on this ot field and very

1316
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,400
patience

1317
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,640
to continue to run with these kind of

1318
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,680
environment because

1319
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,800
believe me it takes lot of time a lot of

1320
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,200
time

1321
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,119
to get the things moved from one to two

1322
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,040
in the plants

1323
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,480
because of the processes because of the

1324
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,640
mindset because they are producing money

1325
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,599
right because

1326
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,800
if your car is running

1327
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,400
why you want to do the maintenance every

1328
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,560
day so there are a lot of

1329
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,040
people uh or not the people i would say

1330
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,720
this is the mindset

1331
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:54,640
which is non-technical as i said i can

1332
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,400
talk about this for two days

1333
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,160
so yeah we we have only a few more

1334
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,440
minutes to go so

1335
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,280
quickly kushwan can you talk about the

1336
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,119
challenges you have and we will go to dr

1337
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:06,800
kazi and dr faro to

1338
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,720
see how uh bjti and their

1339
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,119
the consortium is actually trying to

1340
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:14,560
solve this problem so kushwant

1341
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,520
over to you quickly yes so just

1342
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:18,560
continuing from what

1343
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,960
mayor said we often get requirements

1344
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,400
from teams

1345
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,280
at the oen side that are not from

1346
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,440
automotive embedded engineering as such

1347
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,839
but the id teams because somebody in the

1348
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:30,480
team is

1349
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,319
a cyber security expert so the

1350
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:33,839
requirements are like okay do you have

1351
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:35,040
iso 2700

1352
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:36,640
certification can we audit you and we

1353
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,079
are like oh really

1354
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:41,599
so there is a gap of language yes

1355
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,520
and understanding from both sides cyber

1356
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:45,359
security or cyber physical systems will

1357
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:45,760
need

1358
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,640
cross-functional teams so right however

1359
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,359
there is a

1360
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:51,599
cross-functional team uh sourcing the

1361
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:53,119
security technologies

1362
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,720
i am confident they will come up with

1363
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,400
far better understandable language as

1364
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,599
well as far

1365
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:00,000
uh more effective uh you know sourcing

1366
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,119
patterns that's one

1367
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,599
uh second um challenge that we often see

1368
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,040
is uh

1369
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,200
now may you mentioned that out of 100

1370
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:08,240
series not even five

1371
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,280
are useful uh in our case uh out of

1372
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,480
maybe 500

1373
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:14,880
we don't even find automotive or well

1374
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,800
rather embedded automotive cyber

1375
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:18,079
security experts

1376
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:20,960
it's it's barely half uh percentage

1377
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,319
point five percentage points

1378
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,800
so when when we look at this kind of a

1379
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,319
scenario we need

1380
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:28,240
a a play field somewhere where people

1381
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,079
can come where

1382
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,760
cross domain experts can come and

1383
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,359
experiment right

1384
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:35,520
of course i cannot give my car to uh you

1385
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,800
know

1386
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,480
frank and his colleagues to really blow

1387
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,560
up right but there is something that is

1388
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:41,040
missing

1389
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,319
for people to try out which will give us

1390
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:44,640
far

1391
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:48,160
more uh better experts as i see

1392
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,240
yeah that's great actually that brings

1393
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,599
me to the next question to

1394
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,480
dr farooq to just check to understand

1395
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,200
what

1396
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,119
what what is the academy or the

1397
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,040
universities or indian

1398
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,359
ecosystem is doing to address this

1399
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:02,480
challenge and this

1400
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,920
also looks like a great opportunity for

1401
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,280
us to play in this field i mean as

1402
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,000
indian

1403
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,720
um i mean emerging market and the talent

1404
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,079
we have great talented

1405
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:13,119
guys on this forum and in this area

1406
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:14,319
but i think it's it's probably looks

1407
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:16,240
like we need to probably overcome some

1408
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,800
barriers and challenges to make this

1409
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,720
a global contribution from our side so

1410
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,800
dr faro can you throw a little bit light

1411
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:23,760
about the capabilities that you are

1412
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:24,960
building

1413
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,520
yes sure so uh again i would like to

1414
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,000
continue

1415
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,200
with where the khushwant left his uh

1416
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,680
answer so let's say if i want to talk

1417
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:34,560
about uh

1418
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,359
the hacking or cybersecurity studies for

1419
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,040
the automobile sector

1420
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,040
so i cannot provide car for

1421
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,720
experimentation purpose because that

1422
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,720
will be huge investment as such

1423
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,800
so from the academia point of view the

1424
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,480
challenging part for the cyber physical

1425
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,599
system is

1426
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:52,000
how can we create a test bed which can

1427
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:53,119
actually mimic

1428
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:55,839
realistically the actual system while

1429
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:57,599
authentically preserving all the

1430
00:46:57,599 --> 00:46:59,920
challenges of cyber security as it is

1431
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,319
so it should not be too diluted for a

1432
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:03,920
person who is interested in

1433
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,240
doing research in the cyber security at

1434
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,079
the very same time i should have enough

1435
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:10,079
amount of financial resources to create

1436
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,000
that kind of environment for example

1437
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,560
ah kushman told about the car car will

1438
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,119
be still

1439
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:17,119
okay but just see that i want to do

1440
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,400
research in the

1441
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:21,920
critical energy infrastructure so it is

1442
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,839
virtually impossible for me to create

1443
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:25,680
kind of environment in my laboratory

1444
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,240
setup

1445
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,079
where i can actually have some 500

1446
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,000
megawatt of generation plant and then i

1447
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:30,880
can showcase

1448
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,880
how this succinate attack can happen in

1449
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:33,920
terms of my

1450
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,079
industrial control system so the biggest

1451
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:37,839
challenge in case of cyber

1452
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:40,160
physical system is the test bed which

1453
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:42,319
will be helpful for honing the skills of

1454
00:47:42,319 --> 00:47:42,800
the

1455
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,880
budding researchers who are interested

1456
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,960
in doing research in the cyber physical

1457
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:47,599
system

1458
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,240
i think that is the important one so i

1459
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:52,240
can put this as a cyber range

1460
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,400
basically so like if you want to

1461
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,079
practice shooting you will have

1462
00:47:56,079 --> 00:47:58,079
shooting range you cannot just walk

1463
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,680
along the road and start killing the

1464
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,559
people just

1465
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:02,480
for the sake of learning how to shoot

1466
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,000
like you will have some shooting

1467
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,960
range similarly for cyber security study

1468
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,000
and research in

1469
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:10,079
critical infrastructure you need to have

1470
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:12,079
cyber range to be present

1471
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:14,880
i kind of spend lacks of rupees on plc's

1472
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,079
and giving it to the

1473
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:17,680
researcher to see whether

1474
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,440
vulnerabilities exist or not

1475
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,839
so typically in case of i.t environment

1476
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:24,240
the research in cyber security becomes

1477
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:27,119
better because you have os top 10

1478
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,040
vulnerabilities you can find out

1479
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,880
certain websites which will allow you to

1480
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:33,040
practice those top 10 vulnerabilities

1481
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,599
but in case of cyber physical system we

1482
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,040
are not having such kind of

1483
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:40,000
uh cyber range or the test bed where we

1484
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,040
can actually

1485
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,119
try our hands and anthrax will agree

1486
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:44,559
with me and entire

1487
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:47,440
nalcona payatu team also agree will with

1488
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,400
me is

1489
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,040
when we talk about cyber security there

1490
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,319
is a very

1491
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,960
narrow gap between what is ethical

1492
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,079
hacking and what is

1493
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:59,680
non-ethical hacking so if i am trying to

1494
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:02,240
look at how expert i am and infiltrate

1495
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:03,599
into some energy

1496
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:06,000
utility let us say i do not know what

1497
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,079
one click of mine will take me

1498
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,720
to what kind of directions right these

1499
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,040
are some of the issues i feel personally

1500
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,520
one is the cyber range or the test bed

1501
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,079
where people

1502
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,480
can try their luck and then secondly uh

1503
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,480
having some kind of understanding about

1504
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,800
where the ethical and non ethical

1505
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:24,160
hacking boundaries

1506
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,839
uh exist so these two are i feel are the

1507
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,520
prominent one

1508
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,480
so um dr farooq you're also a part of

1509
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:33,839
some of the government of india

1510
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:34,880
initiatives

1511
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,559
are there any initiatives that are going

1512
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,880
on in that space or in this space and

1513
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,760
uh where our young talent can come and

1514
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:42,960
either participate

1515
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,000
or maybe compete or in some way

1516
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,119
contribute to this

1517
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:50,000
this larger problem and we can together

1518
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,079
uh contribute globally actually not

1519
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,359
just looking at the indian but globally

1520
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,200
can you talk a little bit about that

1521
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,559
definitely definitely

1522
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:00,400
so one interesting thing is not many

1523
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,000
people are aware actually

1524
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:04,400
that dst department of science and

1525
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,880
technology which is equivalent of nsf

1526
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:09,520
uh nfs in the us which actually gives

1527
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,880
funding to a lot of research

1528
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,200
organizations is having a special

1529
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,280
initiative on cyber physical system

1530
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,160
itself

1531
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:19,119
that is called as icps interdisciplinary

1532
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:20,720
cyber physical system

1533
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,960
and you will not believe the budget

1534
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,040
which is allocated for this

1535
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,280
this initiative started very recently

1536
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,040
around three years back or so

1537
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:30,800
and the budget which is allocated for

1538
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,160
this initiative is

1539
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,599
close to 3500 crore rupees and they are

1540
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:36,800
not just funding the

1541
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,720
academic institute they are also funding

1542
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,640
the startups they are also funding

1543
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:42,640
some kind of startup incubation centers

1544
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,559
which are typically focused around

1545
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,880
cps or cyber physical systems so

1546
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,480
government is also ini

1547
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,480
taking lot of initiatives in the area of

1548
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:53,119
cyber physical system in

1549
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:55,119
predominantly in the last five years or

1550
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:56,160
so and

1551
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,480
i think a lot of buzz is coming around

1552
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:01,520
with the cps term now

1553
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,800
wow okay so if if anybody has any

1554
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,559
questions so they can reach out to you

1555
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,160
can they can they reach out to you just

1556
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:10,800
to know a little bit more about this

1557
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,680
my pleasure it in fact not the dst is

1558
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,200
funding itself but there are a lot many

1559
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,720
other opportunities and

1560
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:19,440
our own lab actually in bjt mumbai is

1561
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:20,960
having almost a

1562
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,040
very realistic test bed which is done

1563
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,640
with the industry partnership like

1564
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:25,680
siemens

1565
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,440
then lnt infotech emerson g schneider

1566
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:31,599
so all they have contributed in terms of

1567
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:33,200
their hardware devices and we have

1568
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,079
created a

1569
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:36,000
close to realistic scenario for the

1570
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,599
critical infrastructure so we will be

1571
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,240
open

1572
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,240
if anybody wants to reach out to us and

1573
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:41,280
try to

1574
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,280
work on certain kind of ideas we can

1575
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:45,040
allow the access to

1576
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,480
these interested passionate people

1577
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,119
we will be happy thank you thanks thank

1578
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:52,319
you dr farooq

1579
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:54,800
um quickly i think we are really low on

1580
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,160
time now uh

1581
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,000
might probably now uh interrupt us but

1582
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,000
yes questions from the

1583
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,559
from the uh audience do you receive any

1584
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,160
questions that we should ask

1585
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,319
yes uh i have received few questions and

1586
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:12,720
i have some my questions as well to add

1587
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:14,640
but uh thank you so much for this

1588
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,200
amazing uh session uh i think

1589
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,079
the cyber physical system uh panel was

1590
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:22,319
really interesting and we should have

1591
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:24,559
more discussions around it rather than

1592
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:25,760
just you know

1593
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,599
uh iot 4.0 and stuff like that uh

1594
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:33,359
so yes uh i have uh one suggestion to

1595
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:34,319
kushwant uh

1596
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:37,760
i i know that you mentioned in

1597
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:40,319
india one of the points that it is

1598
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,599
difficult to find

1599
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,880
uh embedded security engineers or

1600
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,240
embedded engineers

1601
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,800
uh i'm doing a soft selling over here if

1602
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:49,760
you're interested

1603
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:52,160
uh do contact our pio2 team if you need

1604
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,520
any resources

1605
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:56,559
but we have opened a

1606
00:52:56,559 --> 00:52:59,720
hardware related uh job channel on

1607
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,280
hardware.squad server

1608
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,359
so if you have requirements uh let us

1609
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:04,720
know we'll post it out for you

1610
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,319
you know we have more than 500 hardware

1611
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:07,920
security engineers over there

1612
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:10,400
uh i think they would like to work with

1613
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,200
escript

1614
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:14,800
uh and itas over there uh

1615
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,599
dr kazi uh you have spoken at nalcon and

1616
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:18,480
you have seen

1617
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,119
how the community physically interacts

1618
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:22,079
uh

1619
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:24,720
and uh i think when it comes to test

1620
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:25,599
beds right

1621
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:29,280
uh i know it involves a lot of finance

1622
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,319
uh but uh how can we make it

1623
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:34,880
uh publicly available to the community

1624
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:35,599
uh

1625
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:38,400
because when i come from the nulcon

1626
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:39,680
community or the industry

1627
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,319
over here we are eager to play with uh

1628
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:44,319
various hardware you give us a car we'll

1629
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,440
try to find

1630
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:48,160
a bug you give us you know let's say a

1631
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,520
smart meter or something we are willing

1632
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:50,160
to

1633
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,800
do research but the community always

1634
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,400
says we don't have access to it

1635
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:55,839
and the industry says we don't have

1636
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,760
researchers to uh

1637
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,160
find uh vulnerabilities of security

1638
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,520
issues and critical infrastructure so

1639
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,119
how do we bridge this graph

1640
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,520
uh i do not know making test beds

1641
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,480
available

1642
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:10,160
which are only for private companies uh

1643
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,240
if they can make it to public i do not

1644
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,599
know if there is any public

1645
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:16,800
uh or uh private initiative as such

1646
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:17,839
where people can work

1647
00:54:17,839 --> 00:54:19,839
and enroll for doing some kind of

1648
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:21,280
hardware related research

1649
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:22,960
apart from the academy i know academia

1650
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,559
has all the funds and connects with the

1651
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:25,680
industry but

1652
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,680
for the public and the private industry

1653
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:30,160
is there any forum at least in india or

1654
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,160
outside

1655
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,040
uh in india we do not have uh this kind

1656
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,960
of facility you rightly pointed out this

1657
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:38,000
is some kind of weakness

1658
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:40,880
that we need to actually approach to

1659
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:41,839
concerned

1660
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:43,760
government agencies and propose them

1661
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,040
that we would like to have

1662
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,720
such kind of test but it will be

1663
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:48,640
accessible to everybody

1664
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,559
so to answer to your question in india

1665
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:52,160
we are not having such kind of facility

1666
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,000
available although

1667
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,079
institutes and organizations have built

1668
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:57,839
the test bed for cyber physical system

1669
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:59,520
but that is restricted for their own

1670
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:00,319
research

1671
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,880
and not publicly available now as far as

1672
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,720
our test bed is concerned we

1673
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,040
make it open whenever we conduct some

1674
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:07,760
hackathons

1675
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,000
etc and that time people can log in

1676
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,520
remotely and try to

1677
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,440
work around and play around with the

1678
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,240
systems but recently with the corona we

1679
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:17,599
actually realized because

1680
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:19,359
a lot of our own researchers were

1681
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:21,440
accessing our test bed remotely

1682
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,520
so i take your suggestion as a very

1683
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,359
valid point and i will try to see

1684
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:27,040
if something can be done in such a way

1685
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:29,920
that some time zones can be allocated

1686
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,559
which will not be disturbing our ongoing

1687
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,000
research whereas some slot may

1688
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,079
be made known to the people who would

1689
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:37,119
like to uh

1690
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:39,520
work further so i think this this can be

1691
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:41,359
a good outcome of this panel discussion

1692
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:42,160
and we will

1693
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:44,160
surely work with nalcon and other team

1694
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,799
members to see that how we can

1695
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:48,799
decide the modality of this but that's a

1696
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:51,119
good suggestion

1697
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:55,599
thank you really really amazing hey

1698
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:57,280
hey kushwar do you want to talk about

1699
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,640
the virtualized platforms which are

1700
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:02,079
hardware and loop systems we're now

1701
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:03,839
turning virtual yeah

1702
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,359
so with a very recent announcement and a

1703
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:09,280
great amount of learning from 10 years

1704
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:10,799
frank and his team are not happy with

1705
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:12,960
the decision but

1706
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,880
but we just decided to move away from

1707
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,079
hardware platform so

1708
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:18,079
uh dr farooq had mentioned that how

1709
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:20,000
about making available a

1710
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,240
a lab car let's say a car that is that

1711
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:24,559
can be completely simulated in the

1712
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:26,319
lab so we used to have this kind of a

1713
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:28,240
solution but over the period of time we

1714
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:29,359
realized that

1715
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:31,520
the number of such systems needed is so

1716
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:32,480
less that

1717
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,240
there is no break-even from really from

1718
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:36,079
the commercial point of view maintaining

1719
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:38,079
all of those hardware in the portfolio

1720
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:39,680
is is quite a challenge

1721
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,319
so we have done away with the hardware

1722
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:43,119
part of it

1723
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:45,520
now what remains is all the electronic

1724
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:46,559
control units

1725
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,640
uh will be virtualized uh slowly

1726
00:56:48,640 --> 00:56:49,920
steadily so we are coming up with

1727
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,520
solutions that can virtualize electronic

1728
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:53,119
control units that are going to be

1729
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:56,799
uh used in a car network for that matter

1730
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:59,920
and these uh ecu's virtual ecu's then

1731
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:00,559
work

1732
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,640
on a virtual core simulation platform

1733
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:04,240
called as quotient from etas

1734
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,440
so together what uh we um

1735
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,960
sort of are offering is a uh software in

1736
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:11,680
loop system

1737
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,000
or model in loop system so removing the

1738
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,200
hardware and loop part

1739
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,799
that will also help digitize some of

1740
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:19,040
this uh remote operations still need to

1741
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,240
be explored

1742
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,799
but uh near real-time behavior can be

1743
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:24,799
guaranteed out of this

1744
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:27,119
cell platforms now how to do security

1745
00:57:27,119 --> 00:57:28,319
testing on it

1746
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:31,760
uh since 2016-17 in japan we used to use

1747
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:33,599
some variants of these products and

1748
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:35,440
introduce bugs in those and then

1749
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:37,920
conduct

1750
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,119
some hackathons there similar kind of

1751
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,559
environment can be created

1752
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:45,440
and i don't see a reason why these

1753
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,040
virtual solutions cannot

1754
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,760
help in in contributing to such

1755
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,200
initiatives

1756
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:53,920
wow that looks like a very uh very good

1757
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:54,480
but

1758
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,400
i think probably commercial reasons

1759
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,480
might limit i don't know what is the

1760
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:01,200
uh the aspect of uh making these

1761
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,040
available to the public or

1762
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,640
even um from a perspective of

1763
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:09,200
learning this thing right it's so maybe

1764
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,000
you can

1765
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:13,440
quick peek there so um first part is

1766
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,200
making a solution that can really create

1767
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,640
this virtual ecu so

1768
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:19,520
there is some time uh that it will take

1769
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:19,920
it

1770
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,359
has been working on the virtual issues

1771
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:23,040
we had some solutions that used to give

1772
00:58:23,040 --> 00:58:23,520
this

1773
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,520
it is called something isolated or

1774
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,640
something like that

1775
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,319
but they have decided to look at some

1776
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:30,160
other strategies because uh

1777
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,000
the original solution used to take a lot

1778
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,319
of time i mean in terms of a lot of

1779
00:58:34,319 --> 00:58:35,200
information

1780
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:38,640
um simulation now they want to go

1781
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,400
at uh maybe little higher level of

1782
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:42,319
abstraction and

1783
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:44,000
that may take a year year and a half

1784
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,200
research by the time you really

1785
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,440
introduce the solution in a full budget

1786
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,839
um and commercially as long as there is

1787
00:58:49,839 --> 00:58:51,359
less hardware involved

1788
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:54,559
uh frank um i can i can say that

1789
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:58,480
things can be worked out right right

1790
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:01,520
right yeah that's that's a great point i

1791
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,280
think for all the leaders who are

1792
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:04,960
working here i think cyber ranges if

1793
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:06,960
yeah publicly that's a big challenge

1794
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,640
but also even within a corporate

1795
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,400
environment if you need to have a range

1796
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,319
where your software experts want to play

1797
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:12,960
out on

1798
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,960
uh cyber security that was a challenge

1799
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:16,799
but now with things getting virtualized

1800
00:59:16,799 --> 00:59:18,240
probably that challenge from a cost

1801
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,000
perspective is getting uh

1802
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:22,480
uh we are mitigated to an extent hey

1803
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,440
anthrax

1804
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,839
um yeah thank you for that question any

1805
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:28,000
more questions

1806
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,359
uh frank we are running out of time so

1807
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,599
apologies for not taking more questions

1808
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:34,400
but uh

1809
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,400
mayor i hope to see you in goa

1810
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:37,839
physically uh

1811
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:41,119
whenever we do nalcon and uh

1812
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:43,839
yeah thank you dr faro thank you kuchwan

1813
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:44,880
thank you frank

1814
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,960
for this amazing session and sharing

1815
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:47,920
insights

1816
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,240
uh like i said uh nalcon and the

1817
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:52,079
community in india would like to partner

1818
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:53,200
with y'all if y'all have

1819
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,680
any uh initiatives where the public or

1820
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:57,040
this community can

1821
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,920
uh collaborate in doing any kind of test

1822
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:00,400
could be

1823
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,280
automotive could be you know civil

1824
01:00:03,280 --> 01:00:04,160
engineering

1825
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:07,200
or even uh let's say manufacturing so

1826
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,720
yes uh we would be more than happy to

1827
01:00:08,720 --> 01:00:10,160
collaborate with academia and

1828
01:00:10,160 --> 01:00:12,880
industry so thank you guys again thank

1829
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:14,000
you so much thank you for

1830
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:25,520
the opportunity thanks
