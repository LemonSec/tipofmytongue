awkward part where i start sharing and i

98
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:30,720

99
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,760

101
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,640
yeah here we go so the uh the talk is um

102
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,840
that that as well it's uh yeah this is

103
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,680
actually my first nail con presenting uh

104
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,080
with

105
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,519
you know buckrat supported nilcon for

106
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,080
many years um i have not

107
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,239
been there physically for the conference

108
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,080
yet it is still very much on the to-do

109
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,239
list um i i figured uh

110
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,840
you know doing it virtually i mean it's

111
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,200
not as good as being there on the ground

112
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:57,920
with all your

113
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,239
all you folk but uh we'll we'll take it

114
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:01,760
anyway so let's get started so the talk

115
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,120
today is security research

116
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,040
uh and disclosure i'm seeing the thumbs

117
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,159
up um

118
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:09,280
the unauthorized biography um

119
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,040
really what we're gonna talk through is

120
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,560
is kind of you know a bit of a history

121
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,239
of how we got to where we are today

122
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:16,160
you know what the market is doing and

123
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,759
what that means in terms of being able

124
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,358
to spot opportunity coming over the

125
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,238
horizon

126
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:22,000
uh you know some of the things that that

127
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,360
bug hunters and people involved in

128
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,360
security research can think about

129
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,360
to really you know maximize their

130
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,960
potential maximize their opportunity

131
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,160
going forward just ways to think about

132
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,360
how they direct their effort because

133
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,320
there's a lot of stuff

134
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,320
right and i think being able to choose

135
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,000
and find the things that are most

136
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,400
you know powerful and exciting for you

137
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,600
but also that are going to be most

138
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,199
valuable in the market is a really

139
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,400
interesting thing to start thinking

140
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,120
about

141
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,160
so who am i um i just got a glowing

142
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,759
uh setup there so i won't go too much

143
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,360
further into it i do have the the hack

144
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:49,840
hustle

145
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,240
uh the hack hustle kind of persona split

146
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,160
um so my background is actually as a pen

147
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,000
tester offensive security person

148
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,720
moved into solutions architecture became

149
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,680
an entrepreneur

150
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,520
and eventually started bug crowd which

151
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,440
was about nine years ago now

152
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,440
um so there's you know casey in the suit

153
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,120
and then casey kind of blurry

154
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,720
you know saying mean things to people on

155
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,400
twitter about security it's um

156
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,000
it's an interesting duality if you carry

157
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,440
but it's i think a part of what i

158
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,240
enjoy most about my job so yeah founder

159
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,080
chairman and cto of bug crowd

160
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,919
i'm also the founder of disclosure

161
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,440
project um

162
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,479
yeah i've just been through my

163
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,160
background so about 20 years in infosec

164
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,360
i got into this straight out of high

165
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,639
school i mean i was hacking the whole

166
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,320
time as a kid but pretty much started

167
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,199
getting into it

168
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:32,080
as a job uh as soon as i finished high

169
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,400
school

170
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,400
um quite by accident to be honest but

171
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,600
it's turned out

172
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,759
pretty well so i'm not regretting that

173
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,720
um so yeah

174
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,880
pioneered the the crowdsource security

175
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,080
as a service model we're not the

176
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,759
inventors of vulnerability disclosure of

177
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,199
bug bounty programs but there wasn't

178
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,600
anyone else doing it when we started so

179
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,720
you know as as far as our role in

180
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,080
basically taking this to something

181
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,919
that's i think considered quite normal

182
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,319
now um incredibly proud of that i think

183
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,000
one of the big things that i have is

184
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,800
just

185
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,440
you know removing the demonization of

186
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,000
hackers

187
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,479
in in in the minds of people i think

188
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:05,759
folks just in general

189
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,199
they're very familiar with the concept

190
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,039
of burglars and locksmiths

191
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,720
um i think the digital equivalent that

192
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,400
we have online is is a bit more new to

193
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,280
people so

194
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,639
yeah we've put a lot of effort into

195
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,919
trying to get people to understand that

196
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,120
and i feel like it's been

197
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,120
yeah a pretty good success over the past

198
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,720
period of time um

199
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,759
i'm a husband father sorry i'm just on a

200
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,120
call

201
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,840
thank you it's all good

202
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,000
so i'm literally in brisbane for

203
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,520
crikeycon as well right now so i'm doing

204
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,280
this from a hotel we told housekeeping

205
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,039
not to come and they've just come so

206
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,600
there we go doing it live covert style

207
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,240
um

208
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,919
australian husband father of two i'm

209
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,360
normally in san francisco we actually

210
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,960
bugged out to come back to australia to

211
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,560
be close to family ahead of covert and

212
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,840
we're still here i'm looking forward to

213
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,880
getting back there

214
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,400
uh once things kind of clear up and get

215
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,919
a bit safer

216
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,000
so agenda all right how did we get here

217
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,759
what is my opportunity how can i seize

218
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,039
it i've already laid that up but really

219
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:58,240
that sort of lays out what we're going

220
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,960
to be talking about today but first

221
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,960
thank you all um i preempted this a

222
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,800
little bit as well in the intro uh

223
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,080
and thanks for the invite to do the

224
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,479
keynote but yeah india's been

225
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,240
absolute powerhouse right from from the

226
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,639
get-go um in in 2019 these stats are

227
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,280
from the

228
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,720
inside the mind of a hacker report the

229
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,479
bulk published last year

230
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,360
34 of all of our payouts went to india

231
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,880
and we saw our 83

232
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,720
growth in participation on the platform

233
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,800
it was like all of a sudden

234
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,479
you know a whole bunch of folk thought

235
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,639
oh like the nalcon crew seemed

236
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,639
cool let's join in with those guys like

237
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,160
get involved in security and start

238
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,000
participating in programs

239
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,919
um and you know as i said before like

240
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,160
we're we're we're honored to play

241
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,000
like the role that we play in in being

242
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,440
able to connect you all to opportunity

243
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,080
and

244
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,520
help you be a part of this broader

245
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,280
mission of making the internet a safer

246
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,080
place that's

247
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,599
you know the fact that we get to do that

248
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,520
think like bad guys not be

249
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,520
bad guys actually do good things and

250
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,039
make money in the process i think is

251
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:53,520
pretty

252
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,960
is a pretty cool feature of what we get

253
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,199
to do here so thank you uh and greets

254
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,120
the pharah streaks cyberboy

255
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,879
um who was one of the original hunters

256
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,879
on the platform from way back in the day

257
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,479
uh and the rest of the bug crowd in your

258
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,120
crew over there as well

259
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,319
all right um when i was

260
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,319
a couple years back i was riding in a

261
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,520
lift in san francisco

262
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,879
and um the driver was with sudanese he'd

263
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:17,840
immigrated to

264
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,759
to to the us and we're talking about

265
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,039
security and just

266
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,400
risk and different things like that

267
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,120
because yeah it's just idle chat uh with

268
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,440
me

269
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,520
invariably turns into a conversation

270
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,879
about that type of thing

271
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,479
um and he just trotted out this

272
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,559
incredible phrase which i've which i've

273
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,479
probably stolen from him i'd love to try

274
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,919
to find that guy so i can go back and

275
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,440
actually give him proper credit but

276
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,799
this is literally how that went down

277
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,320
it's like all security is the product of

278
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,000
something bad happening

279
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,839
um which is kind of a dark way to think

280
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,000
about it right but honestly it's it's

281
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,360
also sort of true

282
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,880
when you think about people building a

283
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,560
business they're not building it to not

284
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,519
get hacked

285
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,800
they're building it to do the thing that

286
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,640
the business wants to do the fact that

287
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,279
they're induced

288
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,880
they're introducing vulnerability and

289
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,200
weakness and risk in the process is

290
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,720
not necessarily something they're doing

291
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,320
on purpose it's just not the thing that

292
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,160
they're most focused on right

293
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,640
so it takes bad things oftentimes for

294
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,880
people to realize that there's an issue

295
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,560
so that they can start to reduce that

296
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,320
risk

297
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,000
and the thing is that um you know

298
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,440
there's really two versions of bad

299
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,560
things that can happen there's the

300
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,240
actual bad things which i'm going to go

301
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,920
through a list of

302
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,680
but then there's also the the version of

303
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,040
bad things that can happen when

304
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,640
people with a breaker mindset like the

305
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,320
folk listening to this talk

306
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,959
come in and actually show in good faith

307
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,720
what can be done what's possible what

308
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,000
needs to be fixed

309
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,080
ultimately i think you know breakers in

310
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,160
that break of mindset

311
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,680
is really a principle driver of

312
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,279
innovation right across the board

313
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,800
like builders build stuff they have

314
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,399
ideas they take things forward but then

315
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,560
this breaker mindset comes in and tests

316
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,839
all the assumptions that have been

317
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:46,880
created

318
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,560
provides it feedback and then you just

319
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,399
grow and improve and amazing things

320
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,519
happen as a part of that and that

321
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,279
creates opportunity

322
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,800
so let's talk about some examples of

323
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,120
that um yeah the technology

324
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,519
here uh the innovation was unbreakable

325
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,279
locks this is what we credit as the

326
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,200
first security bug bounty that we can

327
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,519
find ever

328
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,360
what happened was a company basically

329
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,160
put out i think it was a 50 000

330
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,880
us dollar equivalent in today's currency

331
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,760
reward in

332
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,800
in the 1850s at the world fair to see if

333
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,640
anyone could break this unbreakable lock

334
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,920
and it was a marketing stunt they

335
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,519
actually didn't think it was possible

336
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,040
but then this guy named charles hobbs

337
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,760
came in and showed them that it was

338
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,720
the result of that was it it basically

339
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,160
there was a bunch of papers that were

340
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,000
created out of that and it became like

341
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,839
this really seminal moment

342
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,360
in physical security where there was a

343
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,720
lot of improvement that was actually

344
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,320
catalyzed by someone who came in and

345
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,680
thought differently

346
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,680
right another example c um

347
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,760
yeah lf1 smashing the stack for fun and

348
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,839
profit buffer overflows are

349
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,920
they didn't magically go away after

350
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,360
after this paper um

351
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,680
far from it to be honest uh but it was

352
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,519
really this seminal moment of thinking

353
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,440
about how to abuse the stack

354
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,360
in in context of a binary in that sort

355
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,800
of construct um

356
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,560
you know the impact of that was was

357
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,920
obviously the the creation the

358
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,000
exploitation of buffer overflows like

359
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,959
later on

360
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,040
you had things like uh you know slammer

361
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,120
blaster nimda some of the like major

362
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,720
like internet wide worms

363
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,440
i mean even wannacry more recently

364
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,040
they've all taken advantage of this type

365
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,920
of thing

366
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,240
you know the result of that has been

367
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,360
like aslr

368
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,000
you know dep nx all of these kind of

369
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,480
memory

370
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,800
protection implementations that continue

371
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,640
to improve and as a result

372
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,240
have actually made some of the software

373
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,079
that he was talking about back then some

374
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,000
of the most secure software that exists

375
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
today so another example of breakers

376
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,480
making things better

377
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,079
uh this one's fun uh sammy the guy the

378
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:42,640
the

379
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,279
the man the myth the legend um and also

380
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,640
he is my hero

381
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,360
um he's his uh worm and this was an

382
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,720
interesting one because

383
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,800
yeah i think when he tells the story of

384
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,399
how this all went down

385
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:55,680
for him it was more of a proof of

386
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,600
concept it wasn't necessarily good faith

387
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,279
or bad faith he was just kind of

388
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,360
noodling on a thing and he went away

389
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,639
came back to his computer

390
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,399
a couple hours later and the internet

391
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,480
had basically melted at that point

392
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,880
um this really was one of the seminal

393
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,000
moments in the creation

394
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,320
of application security as a discipline

395
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,360
across the board

396
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,440
because prior to that you know what can

397
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,600
go wrong like web 2.0 user-generated

398
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,519
content everything's going to be fine

399
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,680
sammy comes in and actually demonstrates

400
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,360
some of the risks that can happen around

401
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,639
that and all of a sudden we've got this

402
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,839
incredible industry

403
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,000
today it's it's a big part of you know

404
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,200
what we see um

405
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,880
our customers and the hackers on our

406
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,800
platform engage with is web stuff right

407
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,160
and this is this is one of the areas

408
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,760
that really precipitated that and drove

409
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,000
it forward

410
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,839
this one's weirder this is actually

411
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,279
machine learning um

412
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,839
and i'll come back to this later um but

413
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,000
machine learning as as a thing that

414
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,320
is just this incredible innovation it

415
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,000
came out then all of a sudden someone

416
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,800
abused it

417
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,399
this was a the great flash crash of 2010

418
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,760
if you're interested in machine learning

419
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,440
i really encourage looking it up because

420
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,040
it's fascinating

421
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,320
as a story basically that dip there that

422
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,040
you can see is a trillion dollars

423
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,800
and and that happened over the course of

424
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,480
30 minutes there was an abuse case that

425
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,000
was sped into a whole set of ml

426
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,360
constructs and it caused the stock

427
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,880
market to completely

428
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,279
basically explode at that point in time

429
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:15,920
um

430
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,200
you know the innovation or the

431
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,200
improvement out of that uh not a whole

432
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,560
lot really because the market likes to

433
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,000
make money so it didn't do too much

434
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,360
about changing

435
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,279
traders and their ability to to

436
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,480
facilitate that

437
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,639
but what it did do was was basically

438
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,560
trigger the creation of policy

439
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,320
uh and other things to make the market

440
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,839
more resilient to that type of deal

441
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,839
here's another one that's a favorite uh

442
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,920
recon right um

443
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,399
so yeah i think the research that really

444
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,160
got this going the fact that people

445
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,760
don't know where their stuff is is not a

446
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,600
new concept that's that's been i think

447
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,000
something

448
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,279
that you know people in the scene have

449
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,199
been aware of for a very long time

450
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,639
and it's been this kind of unsolved

451
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,040
problem uh we solved it internally for

452
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,959
for networks that we know the boundaries

453
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,440
of it as we started to move to cloud

454
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,199
and the whole idea of you know the

455
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,959
computer being out there over the public

456
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,160
internet somewhere

457
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,600
all of a sudden we lost track of where

458
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,279
our stuff was um

459
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,040
nathan jobs came in and did a whole

460
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,199
bunch of research actually driven by

461
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,519
by bug bouncy hunting to figure out how

462
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,839
to identify assets that had been lost

463
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,519
effectively by the user

464
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,519
and and really the impact of that was

465
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,199
was this um

466
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,920
i think kind of simultaneous awareness

467
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,560
across

468
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,160
defenders and builders that yeah i

469
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,079
actually don't know where my stuff is

470
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,440
that was always true but they didn't

471
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,680
really know that so so this demonstrated

472
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,399
that

473
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:34,480
since then you know perimeter asset

474
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,600
inventory is is

475
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
now a category um attack surface

476
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,959
management is a category

477
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,959
this sort of you know set of techniques

478
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,399
and set of things that hunters can do

479
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,240
has driven a lot of success

480
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,839
in the bug hunter community and and

481
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,399
things are improving as a result

482
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,920
i've got two more and then we'll get

483
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,160
into the the other side of this like how

484
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,600
how i think the business builders have

485
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,519
been viewing all of this um

486
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,680
connected auto uh i know this is near

487
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,760
and dear to the to the hardware io

488
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,959
crew um you know really the innovation

489
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,959
was putting the internet in cars we want

490
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,560
features we want things to

491
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,959
to to be cool you know as we're using

492
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,639
the vehicle we actually want this

493
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,120
like fancy internet connected stuff as a

494
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,720
part of our driving experience because

495
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,800
it makes it better

496
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,480
charlie and chris rock up and basically

497
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,320
say hey you forgot security

498
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,480
uh what that did was basically

499
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,160
precipitated we're actually

500
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,320
bug crab was quite close to the coal

501
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,920
face on this one because what that did

502
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,360
was triggered the entire

503
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,680
automotive industry to realize we need

504
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:32,959
help um

505
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:35,120
where can we find hackers and hunters

506
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,560
and people with a break of mindset to

507
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,079
come in and tell us how to better secure

508
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,360
our products because this is going to

509
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,800
become a safety issue

510
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,560
if if we get to autonomous vehicles

511
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,160
before we figured out how to secure the

512
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,759
connected car that's a bad time so we

513
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,759
need to get on top of this right now

514
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,959
and uh you know fear chrysler like tesla

515
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,839
a bunch of the other you know automotive

516
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,720
manufacturers have run

517
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,079
bounty programs and vulnerability

518
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,519
disclosure programs it became a

519
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,320
partnership

520
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,920
so what they did is they changed the way

521
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,040
they thought from hackers being

522
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,320
something out there

523
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,440
something that they're actually very

524
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,519
closely engaged with to make their

525
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:07,040
products safer and and

526
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,519
you know cars are harder to hack today

527
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,079
as a result of that

528
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,720
the last one which is which is fun is is

529
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,480
good old iot

530
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,519
um you know this has just been

531
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:22,240
an incredible space to watch because i

532
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:22,720
think for

533
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,720
a good chunk of time there people didn't

534
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,639
really know what iot was

535
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:27,920
uh and then all of a sudden it was

536
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,519
everywhere and then all of a sudden we

537
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,040
realized that we hadn't really

538
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,000
secured it very well in in the process

539
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,800
so

540
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,399
you know the this is not so much

541
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,079
research this was actually a bad thing

542
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:38,720
that happened

543
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,120
um the mirai botnet which went out and

544
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,399
took out a whole bunch of

545
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,000
of um uh dvrs and webcams that had

546
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,519
default credentials on them

547
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,839
and then that was used uh by someone to

548
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,120
perform a ddos

549
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,800
actually i think it was a gaming spat

550
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,720
there was some the back story that was

551
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,440
kind of funny but

552
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,120
it basically accidentally took down the

553
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,880
internet for most of north america in

554
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,639
the process

555
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,079
so what happened off the back of that

556
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,799
there was a policy around baseline

557
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,000
security controls

558
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,400
for iot devices that was rolled out in

559
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,079
california first and then a bunch of

560
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,599
other places in north america

561
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,919
that's followed suit into other areas of

562
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,119
of the world

563
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,720
and what we're seeing now is a whole lot

564
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,559
of innovation around default by design

565
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,240
like secure by design

566
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,799
uh iot you know development platforms

567
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:24,720
and hardware and so forth that's

568
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,319
that's making all of that area more

569
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,839
resilient because this is a particular

570
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,720
space that

571
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,000
you know i'll come back to this one as

572
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,120
well it's going to continue to

573
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,320
accelerate

574
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:35,919
so all right what do they think of us

575
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,240
like as as we've got people coming in

576
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,200
and and

577
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,799
you know creating the bad things that

578
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,120
happen uh whether they're in

579
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,360
in good faith or whether it's something

580
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,880
like mariah and it was actually someone

581
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,320
doing some the wrong thing

582
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,880
like what has what has the market bought

583
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,360
of us

584
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,960
uh this whole time so you know this is

585
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,840
aka meanwhile in in business land right

586
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,520
there's actually a parody of the the

587
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:58,880
hack hustle thing that i kind of

588
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,000
introduced with um

589
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,760
so i'm going to put my suit on now and

590
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,720
talk about the view of the world

591
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,919
pre-2012 and you know rip good times

592
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,840
is a part of this because i do miss

593
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,280
these days when everything was a little

594
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,120
bit simpler

595
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,480
occasionally there's a whole bunch of

596
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,520
really good things that have happened

597
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,480
too i think

598
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,120
like this is really the view that most

599
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,679
of

600
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,280
of the internet including the people

601
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,440
that build it hard of hackers

602
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,080
um it's like these folk they they talk

603
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,720
funny they

604
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,720
they dress funny they do these weird

605
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,400
things with computers like there's some

606
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,840
movies about it that i don't really

607
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,600
understand they look cool they

608
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,200
rollerblade a lot apparently i'm not

609
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,640
sure how that works

610
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,000
um but it's it's kind of this abstract

611
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,960
irrelevant

612
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,720
thing that's happening over in a corner

613
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,840
with a group of people that i don't

614
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,880
really understand

615
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,480
so okay you know on you go it's all good

616
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:54,160
um but then uh and this actually happens

617
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,760
the joke is that i had absolutely no

618
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,679
involvement in this which is true

619
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,600
um but it happened at the same month the

620
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,200
bug craft first landed

621
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,919
in the united states back in 2013 to

622
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,200
fundraise

623
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,480
this guy did his thing um so

624
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,360
you know what the snowden disclosures

625
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,080
did

626
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,080
uh or created as an impact and this is

627
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,320
by the way not me advocating

628
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,360
uh in any direction um what snowden did

629
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,960
what i'm talking about is the effect

630
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,000
that it had

631
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,480
was that it made everyone realize at

632
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,679
that point in time that hacking is

633
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:26,320
something that

634
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,799
is actually relevant to me and i'm

635
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,000
talking about my mother

636
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,880
my my sister my grandparents my aunt my

637
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,280
uncle

638
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,120
my uncle um you know folks that aren't

639
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,679
necessarily security focal technologists

640
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,600
just lay people that use computers every

641
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,120
now and then they realize this is

642
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,559
something that actually is relevant to

643
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,559
me

644
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,600
then it got worse so basically

645
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,679
you know 2014 was the year of the retail

646
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:50,960
breach so now hacking

647
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,480
like snowden taught me that hacking

648
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,039
happens now i know that it happens to me

649
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,440
um 2015 was healthcare records getting

650
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,880
getting pillaged right across the board

651
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,679
okay hacking happens to me and it hurts

652
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:03,039
because i can't insure that the credit

653
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,720
card's not going to reimburse

654
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,880
my my identity card or my healthcare

655
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,760
records

656
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,640
um 2016 is hacking happens to my country

657
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,120
uh

658
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,720
in the north american example with the

659
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,559
dnc hacks and all the stuff around

660
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:17,760
election interference um 2017 to 2019

661
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,120
was just a raft of just

662
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,960
random stuff like mariah was in there or

663
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,159
something that happened that caught

664
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,440
everyone by surprise

665
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,039
it was basically this ascending

666
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,280
narrative of like yeah this is actually

667
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,960
a really important thing for everyone to

668
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,880
consider and it's impact is universal

669
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,120
it's not just a nerd thing

670
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,960
so you know software is eating the world

671
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,720
and the bad guys seem to be eating the

672
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,280
software

673
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,320
right 2020 was covered

674
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,080
and yeah i think the interesting thing

675
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,080
about covert is that it introduces this

676
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,120
idea that

677
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,880
you know my employees five-year-old is

678
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,720
now part of my threat model

679
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,840
um that's a new thing so so if if a home

680
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,960
network is a

681
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,400
is a predictable extension of the

682
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,480
corporate network then all of a sudden

683
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,159
you've got you know televisions and

684
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,240
toasters and home routers and whatever

685
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,039
else included

686
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:02,559
in a corporate threat model and that

687
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,240
really hasn't been an issue

688
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,559
um and it very all like very suddenly

689
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,159
became an issue in 2020

690
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,520
and of course at the end of the year we

691
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,440
had we had the whole

692
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,039
issue with solarwinds and kind of the

693
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,559
introduction of this conversation around

694
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,400
supply chain attacks which is a whole

695
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,799
other talk i won't go into that too far

696
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,320
now but you see the point like there's

697
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,760
all of these things that are just kind

698
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,240
of

699
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,200
ascending in their narrative to uh to

700
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:25,760
you know

701
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:28,159
basically explain to the market why we

702
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:29,760
do what we do right

703
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,720
so given the fact that um it's such a

704
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,720
common conversation you know really what

705
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,080
happens and what i've seen it's part of

706
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,360
the reason i started bike rider in the

707
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,440
first place if things get repeated

708
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,200
enough at the dinner table they end up

709
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,679
making their way into the boardroom

710
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,559
and what that does is it drives

711
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,679
basically focus

712
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,200
from the organization it drives the

713
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,520
deployment of money into into being able

714
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,440
to do security better it drives security

715
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,840
as a higher priority

716
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,880
which you know is awesome right like

717
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,720
for folks that have been in security for

718
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,960
longer than than the time period that i

719
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,360
just uh just laid out that's a huge win

720
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,880
because because really we've been sort

721
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,039
of standing on the street corner

722
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,640
um screaming at people trying to get

723
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,799
them to care for quite a long time and

724
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,159
all of a sudden we've got this

725
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:16,159
this help of you know what people are

726
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:17,760
already thinking about

727
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,559
um in 2021 i think the question that we

728
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,480
all need to be asking ourselves

729
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,480
and this goes to to really the core of

730
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,840
the talk and the recommendations i'm

731
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,600
gonna drop at the end here

732
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,280
uh you know now what um for those of you

733
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,240
who've seen this movie

734
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,880
finding nemo uh this group of fish are

735
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,480
stuck in a fish tank

736
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,559
for the basically the entire movie and

737
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:40,159
at the end of it they break out

738
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,679
they kind of roll across the street in

739
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,679
these bags and they land in the ocean so

740
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:45,600
great like awesome success we've made it

741
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,799
we've done the thing that we wanted to

742
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:48,400
do which i think is

743
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,159
kind of similar to how security feels at

744
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,600
this point in the market we've actually

745
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,280
gotten people to pay attention

746
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,240
um now what they're still in these

747
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,760
plastic bags they've still got some more

748
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:58,880
work to do

749
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,840
so what i'm going to go through is um is

750
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,200
really from a skills development

751
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,320
standpoint and how to

752
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,679
how to think about that or how to

753
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,360
identify opportunity and think about it

754
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,600
as someone who's contributing into that

755
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,960
some of the things that you can you can

756
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,440
do to answer like now what

757
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,480
um this is a theory that i that i throw

758
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,000
out there a lot

759
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,039
i i blurt out the swear words i'm

760
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,960
australian so we swear a lot

761
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,520
but i wanted to be respectful in in in

762
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,960
that but it's you know called the oh

763
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,799
crap theory for for for a better way of

764
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,520
putting it

765
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,200
if speed is the natural enemy of

766
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,919
security then the rate at which a new

767
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,320
technology category comes to market

768
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,200
predicts how quickly and badly it's oh

769
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,799
crap moment is going to be

770
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,720
so basically the faster something lands

771
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,640
the faster something gets adopted

772
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,200
generally the more severe it's like oops

773
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,919
we forgot to secure that moment

774
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,640
is and generally the sooner it comes as

775
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,640
well

776
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,120
so when you're thinking about skills

777
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,760
development

778
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,120
and when you're thinking about how to

779
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,559
differentiate yourself when you're

780
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:01,520
thinking about

781
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,799
you know what are the things that are

782
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,559
going to be valuable that i can add to

783
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,080
what i'm doing now

784
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,919
to actually firm up the things that i'm

785
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,159
going to be able to do going forward

786
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,840
it begs a pretty interesting question

787
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,440
like are you pondering what i'm

788
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,120
pondering is there

789
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,919
you know an area of technology that is

790
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:18,480
of

791
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,120
incredible interest to you that's just

792
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,400
kind of popped up

793
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,039
um that you expect to see cause a lot of

794
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,480
problems down the track you can actually

795
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,520
start to get ahead of

796
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,640
in terms of how you're directing

797
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,799
security research this is why i started

798
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,799
off with all these sort of bad things

799
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,159
and research pieces because this is

800
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,360
where i do believe

801
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,360
we get to not only you know build

802
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,120
careers out and make money and feed the

803
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,720
family and all those great things but

804
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,320
actually have a tremendous impact on

805
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,760
progress

806
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,880
um yeah ralph ralph waldo emerson said

807
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,480
do not follow the path set by others

808
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,080
instead make your own path and leave a

809
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,960
trap

810
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,720
uh and i think this is a really

811
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,039
interesting way to think about it with

812
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,159
respect to

813
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,000
you know just this opportunity that's

814
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,600
come up over the past eight or nine

815
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,080
years

816
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,840
with crowdsourcing with kind of

817
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,279
distributed connection of talent to

818
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,440
opportunity

819
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,679
don't necessarily jump straight into

820
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:09,440
being someone who does the same thing

821
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,880
that everyone else is doing like that's

822
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,159
a good thing if there's a lot of that

823
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,679
opportunity there but then

824
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,120
starting to think about what your own

825
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,279
things are and developing those i think

826
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,880
is a really smart way to do it honestly

827
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,840
that's how i built

828
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,159
built my career it was it was really

829
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,440
getting in behind

830
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,360
you know people and folks that would

831
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,720
help me along mentors

832
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,279
like my community all that kind of thing

833
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,200
but then working out what that little

834
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,360
that little bit that was just you know

835
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,440
special to to me in terms of my own

836
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,039
interest and what i was able to pursue

837
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,320
that's a lot of how i've done what i've

838
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,360
done in the past so

839
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,640
so clearly i'm a fan of the idea um

840
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,159
and really what it nets out to is what

841
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,559
is like crossed out going to catch fire

842
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,480
next um what skills should i start

843
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,600
building

844
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,320
and we'll uh we'll finish up here and we

845
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,480
can go to q a as well

846
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,600
um so coming back to it hardware and iot

847
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,720
uh it's not slowing down um yeah i think

848
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,080
the thing that's happening with with

849
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,080
hardware and iot is is this property of

850
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,039
convergence

851
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,279
that's kicking into place um it used to

852
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,320
be

853
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,320
you know linux and busybox sitting on an

854
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,080
arm chipset with some radio and if you

855
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,919
knew that then you could do iot

856
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,240
now you've got you know a car that talks

857
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,600
to a smart city

858
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,559
over an api with a cloud backend and

859
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,080
there's this whole kind of ecosystem

860
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,840
component that's very strongly being

861
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,360
overlaid on top of iot

862
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,760
that the more of that you understand the

863
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,840
more you'll be able to um

864
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,440
to speak to it effectively and actually

865
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,760
be productive in in doing security

866
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,360
research and all those things around it

867
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,400
and also i think forming a crew um

868
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,080
you know what we've seen with car

869
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,640
hacking uh as a as a prime example is

870
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,600
there's often

871
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,799
you know one person who really

872
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,880
understands cars one person who really

873
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,080
understands embedded

874
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,159
security then another person who gets

875
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:51,919
radio and another person who gets web

876
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,200
and infrastructure and they work

877
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,880
together as a team depending on which

878
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,679
piece of

879
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,200
of the kill chain they're trying to get

880
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,200
sorted out at a given point in time so

881
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,640
just thinking like that in terms of how

882
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,880
you how you work with your peers

883
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:05,120
um you know covert as i mentioned before

884
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,799
covert um

885
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,159
has really triggered uh a

886
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,480
shift in bad guy thinking around how to

887
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,240
attack a corporate environment

888
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,919
um you know one of the things that's

889
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,919
that's happened is that uh

890
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:20,880
you know zero day for for iot uh zero

891
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,159
day for home routers

892
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,760
that stuff's been around forever but no

893
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,279
one was buying it because it wasn't

894
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,120
super interesting and all of a sudden

895
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,640
people started buying it about halfway

896
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,600
through last year

897
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,240
which to me suggests that you know we're

898
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,760
seeing some active exploitation in the

899
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,000
wild which will actually drive

900
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,840
more investment and more interest into

901
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,159
this space um here's a suggestion for

902
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,440
for a really good primer if this is

903
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,799
something that interests you like if

904
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,919
you're already in this space

905
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,720
go nuts if it's intriguing to you like

906
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,279
start to

907
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:48,720
try to find the places where you can

908
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,159
actually insert yourself and learn some

909
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,640
more stuff

910
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,440
all right next one cryptocurrency to the

911
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,320
moon

912
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,760
yeah seriously like i i i trash talk

913
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,159
um blockchain and cryptocurrency a fair

914
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:04,000
bit because i think um

915
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,120
you know i was around for like the very

916
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:07,919
early

917
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,600
beginnings of it when it was super heady

918
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,200
and not actually generating value in the

919
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,799
way it is today and i still feel like

920
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:13,279
there's

921
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:16,399
elements of it that are a bit absurd um

922
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,000
but we're starting to figure out how to

923
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,320
use it and and that's the thing is that

924
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,600
it's not going to go away

925
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,399
so you know smart contracts as an area

926
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:24,880
this

927
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,039
that's really an extension of apsec but

928
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,520
it's thinking about how

929
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,080
uh immutability gets written into stuff

930
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,360
that's ultimately the product of the

931
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,320
application

932
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,159
uh cryptocurrency exchange security

933
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,240
actual cryptography that's a really

934
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,360
i think there's not a lot of people

935
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,799
really getting into trying to study that

936
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:41,679
right now

937
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:42,960
and and it's an area that's going to

938
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,720
become pretty relevant especially as

939
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,200
quantum

940
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,640
starts to kick in and we start to have

941
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,320
to think about cryptography differently

942
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,760
that's a that's a really

943
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,159
um there's a gap there i think if that's

944
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,320
something that interests you

945
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,200
uh machine learning um it's everywhere

946
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,320
man like

947
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,159
ml is one of those things that that

948
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,760
really frightens me and this is why i

949
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,559
was trying to

950
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,799
like create a um example of where that's

951
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,880
gone wrong that goes so far back

952
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,000
because if you talk about machine

953
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,600
learning as this you know potential

954
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,200
security threat

955
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,360
people just sort of throw it out to you

956
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:15,279
know terminator thinking or whatever

957
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,240
else and you can see them in the

958
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,600
background there

959
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,200
but the reality is that the

960
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,799
exploitability of machine learning

961
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,399
models

962
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:25,919
is not a discipline that really exists

963
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,080
right now it's it's very small but when

964
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,039
you think about how

965
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,559
much machine learning we're actually

966
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,720
relying on you know even like the

967
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,640
selection of which panel is at the top

968
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:34,960
of

969
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,640
my screen right now that's driven by an

970
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,039
ml model in some ways

971
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,559
there's all these different things that

972
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,480
come into it and the question becomes if

973
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,520
these

974
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,679
systems are relying on untrusted user

975
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:47,520
input ding ding ding we've seen that

976
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,559
before with appsec

977
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,840
right it doesn't tend to go all that

978
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,760
great um

979
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,679
how can you reliably manipulate that to

980
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:55,360
create an outcome that you want but the

981
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,720
actual user doesn't

982
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,399
that's what a bad guy might want to do

983
00:29:58,399 --> 00:30:00,080
with with ml and that was the example

984
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,640
from the

985
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,279
the flash crash of 2010. most people

986
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:04,399
don't really know what it's actually

987
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:05,760
doing i think a lot of the time when

988
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,480
i've seen

989
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,279
ml get implemented uh it kind of goes

990
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:11,600
back to that build a breaker priority

991
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,039
piece that i was talking about earlier

992
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,159
on where the builders are just trying to

993
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,200
get the thing to work

994
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,520
right they're not as focused on trying

995
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,640
to get it to do all

996
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,399
of the stuff that it shouldn't and

997
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:23,120
that's where we come in um insider phd

998
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,799
has done a great talk on this

999
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,279
um the defcon air village and their

1000
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:28,960
slack and discord is is kind of a

1001
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,320
diaspora of people that are really

1002
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,840
digging into this type of thing

1003
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,919
the other piece with ml is um i think

1004
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,600
covert has had a pretty

1005
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,559
strong impact on you know what privacy

1006
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,120
means

1007
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,720
um and this is where you know facial

1008
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,320
recognition and all those sorts of

1009
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,159
aspects start to come into play

1010
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,520
and we did a whole bunch of that stuff

1011
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,440
really quickly so i think looking

1012
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,559
back on that over time to figure out

1013
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,200
like

1014
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,039
where was that fragile what do we need

1015
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,720
to be thinking about from a from a cyber

1016
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,799
security standpoint to make sure that

1017
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:59,440
privacy is preserved that's going to be

1018
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,799
a pretty interesting space

1019
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,000
as well if you uh view privacies outlets

1020
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,519
in the in the group

1021
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:08,080
um apis they're already going crazy

1022
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,360
coverts 10x

1023
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,320
that i think um mostly because you know

1024
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,279
organizations

1025
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,200
this drove a lot of work for bug crowd

1026
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,120
in in the past year you've got

1027
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,039
you know banking customers who've relied

1028
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:20,799
on a branch historically and all of a

1029
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,399
sudden branches don't really exist

1030
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:23,519
because everyone's

1031
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,320
locked down so what that did was force

1032
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,159
digital transformation projects that

1033
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:28,960
they were maybe

1034
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,360
maybe going to do over three years all

1035
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,559
of a sudden they're doing them over the

1036
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,120
next

1037
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,600
you know a couple of months apis play a

1038
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,880
really key role in that and that's

1039
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,480
happened everywhere right across the

1040
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,320
internet at this point in time

1041
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,000
the relationships between the different

1042
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,360
systems are almost

1043
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,279
always weaker than the hosts themselves

1044
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,120
with people doing api testing often they

1045
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,960
approach it like it's a web target

1046
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,840
um and the attack surface is a lot a lot

1047
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,519
smaller so it's actually harder to

1048
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,120
kind of hit up from that angle if you

1049
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,200
think about it as part of an ecosystem

1050
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,200
that's often where the really bad stuff

1051
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,200
falls out so that's just a little tip

1052
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:01,840
there

1053
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,200
um and a lot of people are really

1054
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,039
needing security input here at the

1055
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,159
moment so

1056
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,320
the j-rock talk on on the level up

1057
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,080
stream is a good one for that

1058
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,519
um bonus round hold code like

1059
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,840
seriously there's there's stuff that's

1060
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,399
hanging around that's not cool to learn

1061
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,960
necessarily it's it's not go or you know

1062
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,240
ruby or

1063
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,399
i mean ruby's i'm dating myself by

1064
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:26,320
calling ruby out on that list but

1065
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,679
you get what i mean it's not one of the

1066
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,120
the code du jour languages that

1067
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,480
everyone's learning

1068
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,720
the fact of it is that java still runs

1069
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,399
like 24 odd percent

1070
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,799
of of the asp.net is 21

1071
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,399
i think there's a really interesting gap

1072
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,080
in terms of cobalt

1073
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,720
and some of these lower language lower

1074
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,000
level

1075
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,399
kind of mainframe languages because the

1076
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,080
reality is the people that wrote that

1077
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,679
stuff are actually aging out

1078
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:54,159
they're retiring they're you know going

1079
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,600
off and doing other things the the

1080
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,120
population that's actually

1081
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,240
available to even understand cobol in

1082
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,840
the first place let alone

1083
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,159
like approach it from a breaker mindset

1084
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:05,519
is thinning out

1085
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,440
at the moment and like the reality is

1086
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,799
the cobalt is going to

1087
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:10,559
probably outlive you know the heat

1088
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,720
deaths of planet earth

1089
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,279
it will just be like a mainframe running

1090
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,200
cobalt floating around in space so

1091
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,760
this stuff is going to continue to exist

1092
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,760
and need security input and need people

1093
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,360
to help with it for a really really long

1094
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,000
time and there

1095
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,200
aren't a lot of people that can do it

1096
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,880
anymore so i think there's a there's a

1097
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,559
really interesting gap there

1098
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,120
um and it's kind of in i mean it's a

1099
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,640
it's an interesting language to learn as

1100
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,519
well so i'll just leave it that

1101
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:35,120
otherwise i'll get ranting about cobol

1102
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,840
we don't want to do that

1103
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,120
you know bringing it back to how to

1104
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,919
think about it

1105
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:44,320
and and potentially how to like double

1106
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,240
down and again this is like

1107
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,720
y'all have been crushing this over over

1108
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,159
the past eight years as i mentioned

1109
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:51,760
before like what i'm talking about right

1110
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:52,000
now

1111
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,840
is how to take some of that stuff to the

1112
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,519
next level it's the same

1113
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:57,039
kind of input that i'm giving a lot of

1114
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,480
different places at the moment just

1115
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,279
around

1116
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:00,880
you know the acceleration of security

1117
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,399
and how the hacker community can

1118
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:03,919
actually step up into that and being a

1119
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,279
meaningful part of it

1120
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,000
um really what the cso is is asking

1121
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,199
going back to the nemo

1122
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,280
kind of now what slide is like how do i

1123
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,719
make security useful

1124
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,320
to my business i don't want to just hear

1125
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,320
about bugs you know i don't i don't want

1126
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:16,719
to just

1127
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,040
spend money on on you know blinky light

1128
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,800
things and tools and whatnot i actually

1129
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,480
need to figure out how to integrate this

1130
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,719
into my business and make it a part of

1131
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,159
the overall structure of what we're

1132
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,639
doing for our customers not just doing

1133
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:31,280
to prevent the bad guys from getting in

1134
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,599
so from their perspective really their

1135
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,440
world is this they've got to balance out

1136
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,159
between

1137
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,560
management of business and finance risk

1138
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,639
management of the political risk

1139
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,480
which is like communicating security

1140
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,159
internally and externally out to the

1141
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,760
market as a part of that

1142
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,760
and then like that one piece is the

1143
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,359
technical side which is most of what

1144
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:50,239
we've talked about

1145
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,000
but i wanted to just touch on this at

1146
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,800
the end here to to you know frame up a

1147
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,639
mental model that might be useful in

1148
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,240
terms of how you think about

1149
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,880
your pursuing opportunity going forward

1150
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,079
so what that means is for

1151
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:04,320
us as a community you know we need

1152
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,160
humility we need to actually understand

1153
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:06,640
that

1154
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,040
as we're going to these folk we've got

1155
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,760
things that

1156
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,119
we know that they don't but the

1157
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,359
opposite's also true um

1158
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,760
so as as we do that what i see happen

1159
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,119
and this is something that

1160
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,079
yeah i honestly think i had to learn um

1161
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,680
midway through my career once i started

1162
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:22,880
to activate this

1163
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,480
everything accelerated because all of a

1164
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,079
sudden we were working on the same goals

1165
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:26,960
it wasn't

1166
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,560
it wasn't adversarial anymore it was

1167
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,560
principle and i think humility is a key

1168
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,440
part of that

1169
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:34,640
empathy for for you know what's going

1170
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,359
into

1171
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,960
um not just securing the system going

1172
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,079
forward but how it got there in the

1173
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,280
first place

1174
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,280
because that again comes into this sort

1175
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,440
of spirit and attitude of partnership

1176
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,359
where you get to just be more valuable

1177
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,599
you literally just get invited to give

1178
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,520
more input be more valuable be more an

1179
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,119
integrated part of what's going on

1180
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,320
i think that's really powerful and of

1181
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,680
course skill which is what we've just

1182
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,720
been talking about

1183
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,560
i think finding clear air and working

1184
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,760
out

1185
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,400
you know where you can like continue to

1186
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,920
to pursue the things that are coming

1187
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,359
over the next hill

1188
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,680
um i think it's a pretty pretty good

1189
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,680
investment time

1190
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,359
so to summarize breakers drive

1191
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:13,119
innovation which creates opportunity the

1192
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,240
market for that opportu

1193
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,960
opportunity is ripe and it's expanding

1194
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,200
globally like you all in this group

1195
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,280
know that already but what i'm telling

1196
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,720
you is that we're only just getting

1197
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:23,359
started

1198
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,760
this is this is just the beginning of of

1199
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,040
the markets

1200
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,040
understanding of how to consume security

1201
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,560
and how to actually partner with the

1202
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,400
community to make the internet a better

1203
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,640
place um the scarier knowledge the more

1204
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,240
valuable it becomes which is why i was

1205
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,079
kind of pointing off towards these like

1206
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,119
weird areas that are about to blow up um

1207
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:42,720
i think that's part of the reason for

1208
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,320
doing that is that that's those are the

1209
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,520
things that are going to be incredibly

1210
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,560
valuable

1211
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,880
as you go forward um and as you're doing

1212
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,760
this don't just be

1213
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,280
valuable like work to understand the

1214
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,880
business and actually create value

1215
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,079
because the more you can be doing that

1216
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,000
the more you're escalating yourself from

1217
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,760
just having a technical conversation

1218
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,240
now starting to interface with with with

1219
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,599
the overall company

1220
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,920
um or companies or you know the entire

1221
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,599
internet itself like the internet is a

1222
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,280
product of it being a business

1223
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,440
so the more you can you can work with

1224
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,280
that idea and not just the technical

1225
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,720
ones i think the more effective

1226
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,359
and the more rewarding frankly it is um

1227
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,480
in in the future

1228
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,680
so that's me coming to an end here uh

1229
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,200
the shout out is to join us on our

1230
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,000
discord

1231
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,200
um not now because you've got a

1232
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,200
conference to attend um

1233
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,760
but uh we'd love to see you in there uh

1234

for all of the

1244
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,400
incredible input in years given to not

1245
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,839
just bug crap but the state of the

1246
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,359
internet itself over the past eight

1247
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:52,400
years so thank you very much

1248
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,520
thank you casey so much uh for this

1249
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,200
amazing uh presentation

1250
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,320
i have received few questions uh

1251
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,280
uh i would like to read them out to you

1252
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,680
uh

1253
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,359
you've mentioned about uh

1254
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:13,040
the lock uh the first buck bounty

1255
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,119
was i think some lock in the ancient

1256
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:16,800
histories i don't know when a bunch of

1257
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,000
people were asked to come and break the

1258
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,720
lock

1259
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,960
so uh so i'm just rephrasing that

1260
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,480
paraphrasing that question

1261
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,960
who was your first client and how did

1262
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,480
you convince them when you started

1263
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,680
background

1264
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,480
wow yeah so the first client uh was a

1265
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,480
company called packet loop

1266
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,040
um one of the founders of that company

1267
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,440
is actually now the c show of canberra

1268
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,640
um but he was he's a security guy uh

1269
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,560
i was bouncing the idea four bug crowd

1270
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,560
off him at a conference in australia

1271
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,119
about six months before uh starting the

1272
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:49,520
business and going for the accelerator

1273
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,440
he was like yeah that's a great idea you

1274
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,359
should totally do that and i basically

1275
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:54,960
said okay if we do

1276
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,880
you're going to be our first customer we

1277
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,200
got a deal and we shook on it and and he

1278
00:38:59,200 --> 00:38:59,680
was

1279
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,800
so that that was our first our second

1280
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,280
two

1281
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,920
were um actually charities um so they

1282
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,760
came and said we need security help

1283
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,960
that was when we were trying out the

1284
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,320
whole charity bounty thing which was

1285
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,280
interesting

1286
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,800
um after a little while we actually got

1287
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,200
a deal with google early on which was

1288
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,000
i think our kind of early sign that yes

1289
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,280
this is definitely going to be a thing

1290
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:29,040
all right the second question is uh

1291
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,160
it's regards to uh do you also think

1292
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,800
there is

1293
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,000
a possibility of having more patch

1294
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,920
reward programs rather than people who

1295
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,760
just find bugs

1296
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,240
yeah yeah i i think so um there's

1297
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,119
there's been

1298
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:45,119
a kind of recent trend of people trying

1299
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,240
to do that

1300
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,359
with um with coke ul

1301
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:52,480
uh and and and semel on on the on the

1302
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,640
discovery side but then you know given

1303
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,079
that that's mostly involved

1304
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,320
in open source projects having that feed

1305
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,960
out into incentivizing people for a fix

1306
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,640
um what makes that difficult in

1307
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:06,960
in in corporate land is that you know

1308
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,800
folks are generally fairly

1309
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:11,119
cautious about giving people outside of

1310
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,960
their organization access to their code

1311
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,000
to do the fix

1312
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,560
and and the challenge with with fixing

1313
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,359
vulnerabilities

1314
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:18,960
is that you can make you know the issue

1315
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,800
that you've discovered go away but you

1316
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,000
don't know what else you're breaking in

1317
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,119
the process

1318
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:25,839
um so there's some technical i think

1319
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:26,960
hitches to

1320
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,640
making that something that everyone does

1321
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,560
universally but i do see more people

1322
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,640
you know basically um basically uh

1323
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,160
trying on stuff like that and things

1324
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,319
like the windows the defender i forget

1325
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:39,760
the exact name of it but the the

1326
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,040
mitigations bounty

1327
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,960
that katie started up a number of years

1328
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,079
ago at microsoft

1329
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,440
you know it doesn't necessarily need to

1330
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,960
be hands-on code here's something that

1331
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,480
you can just go deploy to production

1332
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:48,960
it's like

1333
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,319
here's an approach that you can take to

1334
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:51,599
mitigating this you might not have

1335
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:52,800
thought of before

1336
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,400
um starting to see more of that sort of

1337
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:56,640
stuff really that's a that's an awesome

1338
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,920
question because i think i think that

1339
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,960
whole idea around

1340
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,160
not just thinking about how to break

1341
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,400
things but how to improve them

1342
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,400
as well like that's the second order

1343
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,920
impact of a lot of the stuff that we

1344
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,200
were just talking about and i think

1345
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,800
that's a really powerful thing to be

1346
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,000
to be thinking about as well all right

1347
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,440
uh there are a few questions with

1348
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,760
regards to suggestions and guide to how

1349
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,359
to get into bug bounty

1350
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:19,760
uh i i would recommend uh to answer

1351
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,560
those questions

1352
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,119
just join uh the discord channel of buck

1353
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:23,920
crowd and

1354
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,000
yeah to the team over there sign up for

1355
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,280
bug cred you've got the

1356
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,599
you've got the link at the bottom um

1357
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:31,119
buckrad.com try

1358
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:32,640
hyphen bug crowd which is where you can

1359
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,880
sign up as a as a researcher on the on

1360
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,400
the platform and then from there there's

1361
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,760
all sorts of different resources

1362
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,359
the discord's a great place to come and

1363
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:41,119
chat so i think if there's engagement

1364
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:42,480
around some of this stuff we can do that

1365
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,079
there as well

1366
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,000
all right we'll take the last question

1367
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,200
uh casey

1368
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,680
is buck bounty reaching a saturation

1369
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,760
point especially with web application

1370
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,319
bug hunting

1371
00:41:54,319 --> 00:41:57,760
wow um what is bug bounty

1372
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:01,119
is is is usually my my flip of that

1373
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:02,240
question i think

1374
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:05,520
um you know

1375
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,240
my personal opinion uh and and one

1376
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,520
that's fairly strong

1377
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,920
is that vulnerability disclosure

1378
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,560
programs

1379
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,319
in terms of being able to hear when

1380
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:16,640
something's working on the internet

1381
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,079
is something that is just going to

1382
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,160
become normal

1383
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,760
it's it's a normal part of being on the

1384
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,040
internet it's something that everyone

1385
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,680
should do

1386
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,680
i also believe that's not the same as a

1387
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,280
bug bounty program i think when that

1388
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,560
gets confused as being

1389
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:32,240
like a bug bounty program without cash

1390
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,520
people are kind of doing it wrong when

1391
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,440
they position it like that so

1392
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,440
um just calling that out i think bug

1393
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,880
bounty in terms of going out to the open

1394
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,480
internet and saying come hack my stuff

1395
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,440
i'll pay you

1396
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,359
is not necessarily appropriate for every

1397
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:44,400
organization because they don't

1398
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,000
necessarily have the ability to do

1399
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,359
anything with that information

1400
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:50,240
right so from my perspective you know

1401
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,319
vdp is a ubiquitous thing

1402
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,839
then you've got all these things like

1403
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,440
private programs and and

1404
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,599
your programs where there's more control

1405
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,119
over over how you're

1406
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,800
like learning about your stuff getting

1407
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,319
better at fixing it getting better at

1408
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,480
not being vulnerable in the first place

1409
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,880
um i think there's a huge you know a

1410
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,800
very wide open scope for

1411
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,400
the work there and that looks more like

1412
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,839
crowdsourcing that's less of a bug

1413
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,040
bounty thing and more of a crowd

1414
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,960
security thing so that's why i always

1415
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,079
get tripped up on

1416
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:17,599
on the use of terms there so that was

1417
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:19,520
probably over the top as an answer

1418
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,240
um i think um there's a lot of web stuff

1419
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:22,640
and

1420
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,640
and there always will be i i think the

1421
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,760
web you know either

1422
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:29,760
in in in full form or via api

1423
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,079
is here to stay as a way you know

1424
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,000
technology talks to itself

1425
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,680
and the way that we talk to technology

1426
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:37,280
which suggests there's always going to

1427
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,560
be more opportunity

1428
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,880
to give input into that space that said

1429
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:42,560
there are a lot of people doing it

1430
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:45,280
um and it is more i think difficult to

1431
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,040
to find a way to compete and pop out as

1432
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:48,800
someone who's a who's an expert in that

1433
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,800
particular domain so

1434
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:53,839
yeah saturated i think is strong um it's

1435
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,200
definitely the most

1436
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,880
populated uh aspect of of security that

1437
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,599
we see from

1438
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:01,440
from an offensive testing side so maybe

1439
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,640
that's a better answer

1440
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,440
all right casey thank you so much for

1441
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:14,720
this amazing keynote
