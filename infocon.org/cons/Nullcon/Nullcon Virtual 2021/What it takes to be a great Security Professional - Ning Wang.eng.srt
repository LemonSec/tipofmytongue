68
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,560
what it takes

69
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,040
to become a great cyber security

70
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,040

72
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,519
little bit

73
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,640
background about myself i grew up in

74
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,080
china

75
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,920
i studied physics and i spent 15 years

76
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,040
studying physics

77
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,599
getting a phd doing post-docs doing

78
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,040
research

79
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,760
and then after that when i was in my

80
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,959
early 30s

81
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,480
and i decided i will change career and

82
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,519
i went to mckinsey and company and it

83
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,159
was a great place i learned a lot about

84
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,280
business

85
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,239
and from there i entered the startup

86
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,280
world

87
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,920
i've done six different startups in a

88
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,360
variety of roles a head of technology

89
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,400
product engineering and finance were

90
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,519
operations

91
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,599
and i had the fortune to work at

92
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:40,640
hackerone

93
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,680
or lynda.com great places where i

94
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,720
learned a lot from

95
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,760
my colleagues and my mentors and i

96
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,440
joined offset as a ceo at the beginning

97
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,120
of 2019

98
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,599
and here i am and here's a picture of me

99
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,480
uh during the time i was at cal tech i

100
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,920
was going to hawaii

101
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,519
and working in one of the observatories

102
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,920
every month and i was working in one of

103
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,239
the telescopes and this was taken

104
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,599
at the top of mauna kea

105
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:16,798
so what i've been reflecting

106
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,759
what is what are the characteristics

107
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,238
what are

108
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:24,160
important to become a great cyber

109
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,960
security

110
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,400
professional and upon reflecting

111
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,440
upon looking at the people and observing

112
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,800
and talking to the people

113
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,000
i have gotten to know and really respect

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,400
here are the six skills that i see

115
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,639
first one you've got to have the

116
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,000
curiosity

117
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,720
you've got to really want to know why

118
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,759
second

119
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,320
you have to be creative you have to have

120
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,680
the creativity

121
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,320
not everything you need or want to get

122
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,960
done

123
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,520
will be laid out with all the tools that

124
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,720
you want to have

125
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,759
so you have to be very creative and

126
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,639
third

127
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,199
there's no shortcut no matter how smart

128
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,000
you are

129
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
you have to put in the hours you have to

130
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,680
work hard

131
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,600
fourth no matter how lucky you are

132
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,880
and how successful you eventually become

133
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,919
you always run into obstacles so if you

134
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:20,960
give up easily

135
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,120
you will not make it so having the

136
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,240
perseverance

137
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,600
and the grit is really important

138
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,880
fifth in a lot of fields

139
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,520
i think this is true which is you also

140
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,400
have to learn

141
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,120
to have attention to details because

142
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,120
when you don't you end up wasting so

143
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,240
much time

144
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,160
and also when you don't sometimes the

145
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,440
important details

146
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,680
that could be the key to the puzzle that

147
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,000
you may not pick up

148
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,880
and the last one is you have to figure

149
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,120
out

150
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,960
how to learn to develop good instincts

151
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,000
because that you can't use boiling the

152
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,120
ocean approach

153
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,400
to solve the problem resources and time

154
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,600
is always limited and the very

155
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,639
interesting thing is

156
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,120
as i reflected on these six skills

157
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,120
which is i think is what it takes to be

158
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,319
a great cyber

159
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,120
security professional it is actually not

160
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,080
different

161
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,240
from what it takes to be a great

162
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,479
scientist a great physicist

163
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,600
a great many other professions so i

164
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,520
thought it was really interesting

165
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,600
and i'm going to go into some of these

166
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,280
in more detail

167
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,319
so why do i think of that was he you

168
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,720
know when we think about cyber security

169
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,440
cyber security is really much more of

170
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,800
people's problem

171
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,520
than the machine problem is the people

172
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,319
that work with machines with devices

173
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,360
that that creates the cyber security

174
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,039
problem because people are not machines

175
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,400
we're not robots

176
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,440
and we make mistakes and

177
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,720
uh if you think about why we need to do

178
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,960
cyber security jobs and that's because

179
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,960
there are cyber criminals

180
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,400
what are the traits of the cyber

181
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,080
criminals they are incredibly creative

182
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,360
and they're very organized and they

183
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,840
have the perseverance and they are very

184
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,639
patient

185
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:16,319
they're very nimble they're very

186
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,080
practical and they are

187
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,599
very results and impact focused

188
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,639
that's the way they operate and the last

189
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,199
one

190
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,240
which is actually very important they

191
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,039
always figure out way to exploit the

192
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,479
human weakness

193
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,240
if human doesn't have weakness we

194
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,919
wouldn't have nearly as many

195
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,759
of the cyber security problems that we

196
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,840
have but because we're human

197
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,560
and we we always make mistakes we don't

198
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,000
always follow the rules we

199
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,560
oh we don't always do what's the best

200
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,280
practice

201
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,400
and we leave those uh weak

202
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,080
tree traits and holes for the people to

203
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,800
exploit and that's why we have cyber

204
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,759
security

205
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,360
as a challenge and to address it

206
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,000
therefore we need to think about it

207
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,479
really

208
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,360
is a people problem so if you think

209
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:07,919
about

210
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:11,599
the the twitter

211
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,479
breach you know a few months ago and

212
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:15,680
they started with

213
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,160
phishing right it was a very creative

214
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:18,879
and

215
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,919
calling into their center getting into

216
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,560
uh getting the the credentials and able

217
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,280
to

218
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,680
you know penetrate through the system

219
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,560
and there they

220
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,720
started with exploiting the human

221
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,719
weakness and twitter in fact

222
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,958
is very aware of security they do a very

223
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:35,839
good job

224
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,320
but you know your security is as good as

225
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,080
the weakest link you have

226
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,440
in your entire organization and

227
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,519
recently we have all heard about solar

228
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,480
wind

229
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,360
and a few years ago we have target and

230
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,320
solar wind and

231
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,519
target in fact both cases are very are

232
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,519
sort of along the same line it is

233
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,760
your vendor the third-party vendor

234
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,880
system

235
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,640
that that the you know the the cyber

236
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,839
criminals

237
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,839
penetrate through and then because it's

238
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,640
your vendor somehow you know maybe your

239
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,560
guard is a little bit down

240
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:13,600
and and that is where it comes in again

241
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,120
is always the human uh weakness

242
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,240
that god exploited and then i i don't

243
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:20,720
know

244
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,440
how many of you read the article about

245
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,800
what happened

246
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
in the winter olympics in seoul a few

247
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,920
years ago

248
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,519
and it's incredible how that

249
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,120
attack happened and it was so organized

250
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,160
and is so planned ahead you know they

251
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,399
were able to penetrate into the system

252
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,720
a month before and they knew exactly

253
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,240
what they wanted to do

254
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,959
and the people who were you know in

255
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:48,959
charge of the i.t and the security and i

256
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:50,160
thought they did an amazing

257
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,959
job because it was real time they had to

258
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,800
figure out they had the limited

259
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,839
hours barely i think 12 hours

260
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,160
to make sure the whole system is back up

261
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,079
and you have to think on your feet

262
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,560
and then figure out how to get to you

263
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,640
know in this case get the game back on

264
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,360
so that it's

265
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,440
not uh interrupted and so all of these

266
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,800
you know it says this um creativity

267
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,079
this uh is really key so now

268
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,000
i go into the six skills

269
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,120
that i think are really really important

270
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,720
to become great at cyber security

271
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,959
the first one as i mentioned is

272
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,160
curiosity

273
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,040
and what is curiosity it is the fact

274
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,399
that you don't just take

275
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,519
something as given you make sure you

276
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,920
understand and when you don't

277
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,600
you ask why and you keep on asking why

278
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,079
and i think all of us probably know that

279
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,800
you know there is a story about newton

280
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,839
uh asking the question why the apple

281
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:54,160
fell

282
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,079
from the tree whether that actually

283
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,600
happened or not

284
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,920
to me is actually not that important

285
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:00,880
it's because

286
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,800
what's important is that when there's

287
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,240
something you don't understand

288
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,200
you ask why and you keep on asking why

289
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,880
and you don't pretend

290
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,640
that you understood when you don't

291
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,320
understand and

292
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,079
i'm going to go through a lot of

293
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,640
examples and many of those i will

294
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,279
use are actually the physics examples is

295
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,200
because you know i study physics and i

296
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,320
know a lot of those

297
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,279
but they are absolutely interchangeable

298
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,160
uh

299
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,680
for cyber security so

300
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,920
one example i want to show is um

301
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,360
there are two physicists uh penzias and

302
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,560
wilson

303
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,320
and they won the nobel prize in the 70s

304
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,519
for the work they did in the mid 60s and

305
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:47,440
what they wore at the time is that they

306
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,120
were at bell labs

307
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,959
in the u.s and they were two astronomers

308
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,880
and they were using this horn antenna

309
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,519
telescope is a radial telescope and they

310
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,120
were trying to map something from the

311
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,079
milky way

312
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,399
which is a you know the galaxy that the

313
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,560
the solar system is in

314
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,200
and then when they were mapping they

315
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,720
kept on seeing

316
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,519
a noise a noise is looking at something

317
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,560
something on the right

318
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,639
okay and then being a physicist and

319
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,320
having worked in the lab for many years

320
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,120
i will tell you

321
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,000
i've seen so many signals that are noise

322
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,760
like the thing you see on the right

323
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,480
but in their case they saw the noise and

324
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,079
they couldn't figure out what it was

325
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:29,440
instead of just saying you know what i'm

326
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,760
not going to worry about it it's noise

327
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,320
and they kept on saying oh could it be

328
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,519
from the new york city

329
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,920
could be from the radio station could be

330
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,440
from the subway and they

331
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,600
kept down working on it trying to get

332
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,560
rid of the noise

333
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,200
and they couldn't and then one day they

334
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,440
ran to a professor from princeton i

335
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:47,839
think

336
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,440
and the guy was saying you know what

337
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,920
somebody recently

338
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,279
had a theory about cosmic wave

339
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,320
background

340
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,440
and then if indeed that exists

341
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,560
it will be the proof of big bang theory

342
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,600
and if it does exist in this band

343
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,240
you may see some signal and it may even

344
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:08,800
be this

345
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,200
the noise that you see you have to

346
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,440
figure out if the magnitude and the size

347
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,399
and all of that

348
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,040
is what you think it is so they

349
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,560
collaborated on that

350
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,480
and then they were able to prove that

351
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,800
noise they saw they thought it was noise

352
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:25,040
it was actually not noise but it was

353
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,800
actually signaled from

354
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,560
the sky and that was the first discovery

355
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,600
of the cosmic wave uh cosmic microwave

356
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,399
background

357
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,200
which is the first evidence of the big

358
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,600
band

359
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,560
a big bang theory and for that they got

360
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,760
a nobel prize

361
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,600
so accidental discovery and the reason

362
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,000
they got it is because they kept on

363
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,279
asking why

364
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,320
and they would not give up

365
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,079
the next one the next skill that i think

366
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:56,800
is really

367
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,920
important is creativity the reason

368
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,959
creativity is

369
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,199
important in the field of science in the

370
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,959
field of cyber security

371
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,040
is that you never have everything you

372
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,440
need to solve the problem

373
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,680
whether it is a tool you don't you wish

374
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,360
you had but you don't have

375
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,920
or a script that you want to write and

376
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,040
you wish it's already

377
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,920
ready or some other tools and it's a

378
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,639
it's true in cyber security i know many

379
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,839
talented hackers in my time at hackerone

380
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:28,320
they wrote their own tools and that's

381
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,199
what they do

382
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,320
when they start to do the reconnaissance

383
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,760
and things like that

384
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,320
it's the same in science often when you

385
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,600
do an experiment

386
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,360
and you wish you could buy an instrument

387
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,639
to do the measurement

388
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,600
but usually you're so cutting edge it's

389
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,000
just not

390
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,600
good enough whether it's it doesn't have

391
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,120
enough magnification

392
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,240
or not enough signal to noise often you

393
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:50,880
have to

394
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,360
include something or create something so

395
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,880
that you can get the job done

396
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,519
so creativity is about the how it's

397
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,040
about how you do it

398
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,160
so that you can get the job done and you

399
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,320
use something that's not intended

400
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,079
and you use something that may not seem

401
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,519
to be obvious

402
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,079
like somebody at hack at the offset says

403
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,680
when you use something that was not

404
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,639
intended in a way you're hacking it so

405
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,560
creativity is really

406
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,360
important for that reason and here are

407
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,920
three examples i want to say

408
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,000
you probably most of you have already

409
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,760
experienced airbnb

410
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,360
but i don't know if you know how they

411
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,440
started the company

412
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,040
in san francisco there are a lot of

413
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,800
conferences one year

414
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,000
there was this big design conference and

415
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
usually during these conferences hotels

416
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,040
are always sold out

417
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,079
were super expensive and one of the guys

418
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,079
who was going to the conference had this

419
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,279
idea what about

420
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,480
we rent out the air mattress in

421
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,240
our apartment and we make some money

422
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,639
and and they did that they rented out

423
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,160
and they made good money

424
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,480
and that gave them the idea to start a

425
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,199
business

426
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,000
to allow you to rent your spare room and

427
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,320
that's how airbnb started and look at

428
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,040
today

429
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,480
they are like over 100 billion dollar

430
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:09,440
business today

431
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,440
okay huge second one posted i think

432
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,199
that most of us use that and uh 3m

433
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:20,560
that's where that technology is invented

434
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,480
and they were doing research trying to

435
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,320
figure out how to

436
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,519
invent a stronger tape but guess what

437
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,519
then they found the tape that actually

438
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,040
was not so strong

439
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,600
and actually was very easy just to come

440
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,320
off

441
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,399
and you could say such a failure we

442
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,160
wanted to find a stronger tape

443
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:41,199
but instead we found something so wimpy

444
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,880
and uh well they capitalized on that

445
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,000
and that's where post-it got started

446
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,160
so you really have to be creative and

447
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,040
think about

448
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,959
the problem you're trying to solve and

449
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,320
think about the solution

450
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,759
that may not be in originally intended

451
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,000
but you can solve the problem that's all

452
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,600
that matters

453
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,400
on the right uh is uh another nobel

454
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,439
laureate

455
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,280
charles towns and he got nobel prize for

456
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,640
inventing mazer mazer is similar to

457
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,599
laser except it was for microwave it's

458
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,520
the same idea it gets uh

459
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,480
you know uh magnified so they can have

460
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:20,799
that

461
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,520
intensity with very little loss and that

462
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,720
is how

463
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,679
uh microwave is one frequency and the

464
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,120
you know laser is at

465
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,960
optical uh frequency so without mazer we

466
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,640
would not have laser

467
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,760
and with laser technology and network

468
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,600
fiber optics all of that became

469
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,799
available

470
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:44,000
and so it's really really incredible

471
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,840
um when you keep thinking about

472
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,720
how you can solve the problem and think

473
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,000
out of box

474
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,280
and i was um i was at grad school

475
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,360
at berkeley where charles towns was

476
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,799
actually a professor

477
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,280
and we were on the same floor and you

478
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,840
know being next door to a nobel laureate

479
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,640
and just to see

480
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,520
how their mind works and how they are

481
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,000
always

482
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,559
thinking about how to solve a problem

483
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,400
and that by itself

484
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,559
was very inspiring um

485
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,600
sorry um

486
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,880
the third one is you know no matter

487
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,320
how smart you are you cannot

488
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,160
there's no shortcut you just have to

489
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,679
work and the 10

490
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,880
000 hours rule does not escape

491
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,320
any experts in any fields

492
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,720
there's a book written by malcolm

493
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,600
gladwell

494
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,960
called outliers and he did a lot of

495
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,720
research and discovered

496
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,559
in a lot of different fields it didn't

497
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,960
matter whether it's athletes musicians

498
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,160
artists scientists and he found

499
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,280
in order to get to the top of your field

500
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,440
they all have spent 10 000 hours or more

501
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,520
and i was thinking about that that is

502
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,520
like four or five hours

503
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,400
and for me it took me seven years to get

504
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,000
my phd in physics

505
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,400
and i like to think that i wasn't lazy

506
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,360
and it's actually

507
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,679
average for berkeley to get a phd in

508
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:14,480
physics

509
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,200
and then if you look at other uh fields

510
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:17,600
it's

511
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,960
very similar so for cyber security it is

512
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,760
no different

513
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,559
and later on i have an example from a

514
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,960
real person i know

515
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,280
so if you want to get to the top and you

516
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,240
want to become

517
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:33,120
excellent at it you have to do the hard

518
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,600
work

519
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,720
and there's no shortcut so

520
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,440
here is somebody i got to know at

521
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,960
offensive security

522
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,919
and this is a person who is one of our

523
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:44,880
top

524
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,360
content developers meaning this is a

525
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,960
person that will teach a live

526
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,360
class and this is a person that actually

527
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,000
creates

528
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,559
the content for us does all the original

529
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,600
research

530
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,320
and also you know he sometimes also

531
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,200
published

532
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,919
his research work and gave talks and had

533
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,200
publications

534
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,600
and one day we were chatting and i said

535
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,720
you know

536
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,679
how did you become so good you know and

537
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:11,440
he told me that

538
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,080
he actually studied math and physics and

539
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,840
he thought about that and then later on

540
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,440
decided to go into

541
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,559
computers and later on became interested

542
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,760
in cyber security and he said you know

543
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,440
for four years i worked 60 hour

544
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,799
week on a regular basis i read

545
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,520
everything i could get my hands on i did

546
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,000
all the

547
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,360
work and research and and i learned

548
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,480
so much and that was how i kind of got

549
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,760
to the top

550
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,480
and you know there's just no trick

551
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,760
there's no shortcut

552
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,840
and when i heard him saying that i was

553
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,120
saying oh my god

554
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,039
i said that's just like physics it's

555
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,799
just like other fields that i know

556
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,360
so it's exactly the same uh in cyber

557
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,400
security

558
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,559
and he said often there are people

559
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,000
asking him

560
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,799
what do i need to do to become like you

561
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,480
and he said you know

562
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,080
you just have to work really hard and

563
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,679
you have to be into it you have to be

564
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:08,960
passionate about it

565
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,200
and you have to really want it and you

566
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,640
have to work hard

567
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:17,039
and and so and i want to say that

568
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,320
um for all of you who want to become

569
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,799
great at cyber security just remember

570
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:23,840
that

571
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,000
the curiosity you need to have the

572
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,320
creativity you need to cultivate

573
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,840
and work hard the fourth one

574
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,120
is the grit the perseverance uh

575
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,240
you may think that those people who

576
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,520
are who are so successful they are

577
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,240
they have really gotten to the top they

578
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:44,880
are so

579
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,960
lucky that um and they somehow got there

580
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,600
because they're super smart but you know

581
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,320
uh

582
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:55,919
everyone has failures and here

583
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,360
uh i have examples of einstein and uh

584
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,280
you know

585
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,720
i think the whole world thinks about

586
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,000
einstein when you think about somebody

587
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,240
who's smart and you think about einstein

588
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:08,400
so i was reading about einstein the

589
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
other day and then came across and i was

590
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,440
trying to think he's like

591
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,600
you know i think he got a nobel prize

592
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,080
but what did he get the nobel prize for

593
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,960
because i think about what he did what

594
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,559
was really amazing

595
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:23,440
was the special relativity and the

596
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,880
general relativity

597
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,960
for both of which he did not get a nobel

598
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,080
prize for

599
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,200
and he got it for photoelectric effect

600
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,679
and when i read what he did about the

601
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,520
gravitational

602
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,440
theory it took him 10 years

603
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,080
working on that to figure out what it

604
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,880
was

605
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,120
and the gravitational waves and

606
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,799
gravitational theory

607
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,760
and it was the theory from einstein time

608
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:50,080
but

609
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,760
it wasn't until just three four years

610
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,400
ago when people finally detected it

611
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,360
and again that was another nobel prize

612
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,600
for the detection of the gravitational

613
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,480
wave

614
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:04,000
but even for somebody like einstein who

615
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,360
you know unquestionably one of the most

616
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,159
part uh

617
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,640
most smart person in the world in human

618
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,679
history

619
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,840
that he had to work on it for 10 years

620
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,760
can you imagine that

621
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,159
that you you work on something you don't

622
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:18,880
give up

623
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,000
for so many years so it's

624
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,799
really important and um just remember

625
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:25,360
that

626
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,159
remember when you get stuck remember

627
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,360
when you didn't get

628
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,840
a box that you tried to get after a few

629
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,799
hours

630
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,200
it's actually normal it's okay don't

631
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,679
give up

632
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,960
um i also found this quote from steve

633
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,679
jobs

634
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:44,480
apple is a company i admire i admire the

635
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,559
way they develop their products it's so

636
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,760
high quality

637
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,799
they strive strive for the

638
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:54,080
excellence and the products we enjoy

639
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,200
and here's what steve jobs said

640
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,240
that i'm convinced that about half of

641
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,440
what separates

642
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:04,400
the successful entrepreneurs from the

643
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,320
non-successful ones

644
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,080
is pure perseverance

645
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,200
i know in my career i have i have had

646
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,400
plenty ups and downs i have had many

647
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,640
things that didn't work and i have also

648
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,720
had a lot of things that worked

649
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,960
and for many of the other successful

650
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,480
people that i know

651
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,039
personally they have all had their

652
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,080
failures

653
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,320
and if you have a failure where you got

654
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,600
stuck

655
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,640
were you got obstacles where it seems so

656
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,640
unsurmountable and if you gave up

657
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,880
you will never get to the top in fact

658
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,159
just two days ago

659
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,360
i was listening to a talk from the zoom

660
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,880
founder ceo eric yuen and uh he was

661
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,000
talking about it

662
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,440
is that you know he said he

663
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,000
he would give people the advice know

664
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,799
what you want

665
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,760
have a dream know what you want but then

666
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:00,000
go

667
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,360
for it and don't don't let failures

668
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,159
don't let other people stop you and in

669
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:06,960
his case

670
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,520
he tried to start zoom at the time

671
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,000
almost

672
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
nobody wanted to fund him because there

673
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,080
are already so many

674
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,320
video conferencing tools out there why

675
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,320
would the world need another one

676
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,559
and he was so determined because he

677
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,320
thought he could deliver one

678
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,880
that's much better user experience and

679
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,720
their culture is a delivery

680
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,960
delivering happiness and look at the

681
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,760
success of

682
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,360
zoom and so all these people

683
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,000
all these successes is it because they

684
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,559
don't just

685
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,440
easily gave up

686
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,120
um this fifth one

687
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,080
may not seem really obvious but it's

688
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,480
actually

689
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,279
really important which is attention to

690
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,480
detail

691
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,520
and the quote i got uh is from john

692
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,240
foster dulles which is the the

693
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,440
washington dulles

694
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,960
airport is named after it says a man's

695
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,039
accomplishments in life are the

696
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,720
cumulative effect

697
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,760
of his attention to detail i think

698
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,120
we all know the devils are in the detail

699
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,320
in many many fields it's like that and i

700
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,320
think in security we're in

701
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:20,480
software in i.t it is absolutely true

702
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:23,600
and i know myself i cannot tell you in

703
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,159
the days

704
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,960
i was writing codes how many times i

705
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,480
made the syntax error

706
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,720
because the comma the semicolon the

707
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,520
colon

708
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,159
i made the mistake where i had a typo

709
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,840
all of these things that you would say

710
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,200
is not important

711
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,240
but it wastes you so much time when you

712
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,640
are not careful with those details

713
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,360
and you know if you're analyzing a

714
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,039
packet of information

715
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,559
whether it's a header whether it's a

716
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,159
trailer and

717
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:53,279
it may not be really important at the

718
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,960
time you see it

719
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,520
but paying attention to that and later

720
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,000
on

721
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
when you're working on it and then if

722
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,080
you had the mental note it's like

723
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:05,120
oh my god i think i've seen this before

724
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,360
and then you are systematic you take

725
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,159
good notes and you go back

726
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,320
it will allow you to connect the dots

727
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,760
that much more easily

728
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,600
and they will give you the kind of

729
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,000
shortcut to solve the problem you're

730
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,039
trying to solve

731
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,679
so in that sense attention to detail is

732
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,640
really important

733
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,720
the last one is good instinct

734
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,720
and this one is so important

735
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,120
so valuable really hard to get

736
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,640
and i got couple quotes again one from

737
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,600
einstein and the next one from steve

738
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,880
jobs again

739
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,399
is that you want to develop the instinct

740
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,320
so that you can have this kind of

741
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,600
intuition

742
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,720
the intuition does not come

743
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,919
from just repeating the intuition comes

744
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,039
from having done this so many times

745
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,440
having seen so many different kinds of

746
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,799
situations

747
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,240
that you have developed certain

748
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,440
methodology you developed a certain way

749
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,559
of thinking

750
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,440
you develop certain way of looking at

751
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,320
problems

752
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,120
and how to come up with your hypothesis

753
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,960
and you have that hunch

754
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,919
and that's your intuition and the

755
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:25,039
intuition

756
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,600
is what makes some people just so great

757
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,039
because they somehow

758
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,440
have that intuition but the intuition

759
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,360
nobody is born with

760
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,440
you develop it and you have to be

761
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,799
intentional

762
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,840
in developing your intuition

763
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,080
and when you have that when you see a

764
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:42,960
situation

765
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,360
you will you will have a feel for where

766
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,080
to go

767
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,039
and your intuition has to be built on

768
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,159
top of things

769
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,880
you know you have proven you have

770
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,760
practice

771
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,600
to be true what you know to be not true

772
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,039
it has to be be built based on

773
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:04,240
solid knowledge and experience

774
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:07,440
okay and steve jobs says the same thing

775
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,960
the most important is to have the

776
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,200
courage to follow your heart and follow

777
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,720
your intuition

778
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:16,159
and uh and sometimes it's very easy

779
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:18,960
just to go through the motion just to do

780
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:19,360
what

781
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:22,480
everyone else is doing and not think

782
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,440
and just do it doesn't get you very far

783
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,520
so having good instinct

784
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,960
and that intuition is another great

785
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,080
uh characteristic of great cyber

786
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,360
security people

787
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,840
and i would say for that is exactly the

788
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,559
same

789
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,279
for scientists or physics for physicists

790
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,039
so these are the

791
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:46,799
these are the six skills

792
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:50,000
that i think are really important

793
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,520
have the curiosity have the creativity

794
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,240
spend the hours and work hard and don't

795
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,760
think you can become great

796
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,960
in the year or in six months and just

797
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,600
know

798
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,919
ten thousand hours that's four five four

799
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:04,880
five years

800
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,679
minimum it takes to get there have the

801
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:08,240
grit

802
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,960
don't give up pay attention to detail

803
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,080
and by when you do

804
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,520
all of these develop your own

805
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,399
instinct and that is yours you cannot

806
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,039
just

807
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,520
copy others you need to develop your own

808
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,520
and actually there's one more thing

809
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,720
i want to add to that cyber security as

810
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,679
i said earlier

811
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,240
is a people problem when it's a people

812
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:30,960
problem

813
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,200
in order to whether it's on the defense

814
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,159
side on the or

815
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:36,880
offense side you need to see what are

816
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,799
the people's weaknesses

817
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:41,360
so what that means is that you also need

818
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,240
to be

819
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,960
good with emotional intelligence in

820
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,240
trying to understand

821
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,039
the human behavior and that is another

822
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:49,520
thing

823
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,720
that's quite unique about cyber security

824
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,240
so how do you gain these skills um

825
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,519
well at least for me uh whether it's the

826
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,000
people

827
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,640
from the cyber security world or the

828
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,600
science world

829
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,640
that i know very well i find

830
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,960
all of these people the way they did it

831
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,480
is they learn

832
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,200
they have to learn how to learn not just

833
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,480
learning the knowledge

834
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,120
but learning how to learn that's really

835
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,080
important

836
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,000
learning what to put that into that

837
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,159
google bar to do the search

838
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,640
to get the hint or the answer you're

839
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,559
looking for so you can progress

840
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,600
so you learn after you learn the way you

841
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,720
know you have

842
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,240
mastered that concept is by practice

843
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,799
and so you learn you practice if you got

844
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:39,279
it

845
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,679
you move on to learn more if you didn't

846
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:42,480
get it

847
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,720
go back and learn more and that's a

848
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,000
cycle it never

849
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,360
stops in fact it's not that stopping

850
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,159
after an exam after certificate

851
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,000
certification

852
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,559
it's a live learning for those that are

853
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:57,600
at their top

854
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,399
they never stop learning they always are

855
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,799
learning

856
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,399
and this is the one thing i will talk

857
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,039
about for um

858
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,159
for uh offset i this is the only

859
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:14,640
slides i have for offset offensive

860
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,960
security as probably most of you know

861
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,960
we do cyber security training and

862
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,480
certifications

863
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,919
and unlike many companies our goal

864
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,559
our primary focus is actually not

865
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:27,679
certifications

866
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:30,799
is actually training and in our training

867
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,760
what we are really trying to do is not

868
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,559
the knowledge

869
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,279
and the tools we really trying to train

870
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:37,679
you

871
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,880
to develop the mindset to develop the

872
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,760
habits

873
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,480
to develop that we call the try harder

874
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,440
mindset

875
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,240
what does that mean it means for you to

876
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,039
build that

877
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:52,640
instinct that intuition to know

878
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,440
when you are in the brand new situation

879
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,240
how

880
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,880
how do you know where to start you know

881
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,120
whether it's our exam situation we're in

882
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,880
the real world situation

883
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,039
you are presented the problem a

884
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,279
situation you have never seen before

885
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,200
how do you start that's what we're

886
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,399
trying to train you

887
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,519
how to start you start with a hypothesis

888
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,440
you start trying to get a lay of the

889
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,760
land and then from there you have a

890
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,120
hypothesis

891
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,440
and then you go to prove or disapprove

892
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:23,519
it but how do you

893
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,799
develop a hypothesis which is the best

894
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,440
hypothesis to pursue there you need to

895
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,200
rely on your instinct

896
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,600
how do you have instinct you need to do

897
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,960
enough practice

898
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,640
so that you start to have pattern

899
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,000
recognition you start

900
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,080
to think on your feet and you will say

901
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,519
you know when i do this

902
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,600
and if i don't quickly get to what i

903
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,440
think i wanted to get

904
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,519
that means that might be a dead end i

905
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:48,720
need to back out

906
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,440
and i need to reassess do i have a new

907
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,480
hypothesis

908
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,519
let me go again and then you do that

909
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:58,559
you enumerate that and then you will

910
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,279
quickly

911
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,960
be able to find the way in or the way to

912
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,240
solve the problem

913
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,000
and that is the case for our lab

914
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,520
setup for our exam and that is how you

915
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,320
solve

916
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,440
physics problem as well it's the same

917
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,839
approach in our situation in order to

918
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:18,960
train you

919
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,000
we have the real world labs and we have

920
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,679
real world networks

921
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,399
real world kind of vectors so when you

922
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,359
do that

923
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,480
when you when you do our training i will

924
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,359
say

925
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,320
pay attention because what we try to get

926
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,359
you to do

927
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,399
is via these labs it's not for you to

928
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:39,280
memorize

929
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,480
the vectors the machines the network

930
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,359
it is for you to develop the pattern

931
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,639
recognition

932
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:49,280
the skills the instinct that your

933
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,320
intuition

934
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,639
because when you have that that's when

935
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:53,520
you got it

936
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,320
that's when you can become a great cyber

937
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,599
security professional

938
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,680
and you can solve any problem that's

939
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:00,720
presented to you

940
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,200
because you learned how to learn you

941
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,640
learned how to solve the problem

942
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:11,280
so to recap to summarize to become a

943
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,480
great cyber

944
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,680
security professional how do you do that

945
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,000
learn the knowledge but gain the skills

946
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,640
and develop the habits the habits are

947
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,160
really important

948
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,119
develop the habits therefore you will

949
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,560
have the mindset

950
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,800
the try harder mindset the hacker

951
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,599
mindset

952
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,400
the problem solving mindset it's the

953
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:34,960
same

954
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,440
whatever we call it it's the same and

955
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,960
that when you have that

956
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,720
that's when you have you have your

957
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,240
intuition you have the

958
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,720
instinct so when you go through the labs

959
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,400
when you train with us

960
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,160
just think about it that's what we are

961
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,520
trying to get you to do

962
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,560
is to develop the habits the mindsets so

963
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,400
you have the instinct

964
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,680
and the thing um the thing i would say

965
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,720
not to do do not train so that you can

966
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:01,920
pass the exam

967
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,320
because when you do that you just

968
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,000
dropped yourself

969
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,280
the chance to learn to learn the skills

970
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,800
to learn and develop develop the mindset

971
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:16,480
so uh i think anybody can do that

972
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,119
i i learned a recent story where one of

973
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,320
our employees

974
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,680
who actually had no i.t knowledge but in

975
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,640
four months

976
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,960
he learned networking he learned

977
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,839
scripting

978
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,880
he learned the linux admin in

979
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,920
four months he she was ready actually as

980
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,359
a woman she was ready

981
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:39,280
to take pwk and she is taking her bwk

982
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,640
and when i talked to her

983
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:43,520
and she said ning i'm having so much fun

984
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,240
learning

985
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,880
i'm not even thinking about the exam the

986
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,760
the concept

987
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,720
how is explained is so good and i'm

988
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,640
doing the exercise i'm learning every

989
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,440
concept

990
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,240
it is so good and i'm loving it so i

991
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,440
think all the people

992

in the world you want to be a cyber

995
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,000
security professional

996

students in college

1018
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,400
aspiring for korean cyber security start

1019
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,280
with

1020
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,640
uh should they start up with

1021
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,680
cyborg threats and with use of in ai

1022
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,040
and ml or in general

1023
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,640
um you know i think uh these days

1024
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,560
you know uh ai is very it's very hot

1025
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,599
uh you know but i think what's

1026
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,680
important if you want to go into cyber

1027
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,640
security

1028
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,839
is that learn the fundamental knowledge

1029
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:26,880
and skills

1030
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,400
okay so make sure that you have a basic

1031
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,640
solid understanding uh whether it's a

1032
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,440
network

1033
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:37,440
and uh the the uh the web application

1034
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,599
what i found is that you know these days

1035
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:41,680
more and more is not just network

1036
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,800
it's also a lot of web applications and

1037
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:48,480
the people who kind of know

1038
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,560
a little bit of everything they have

1039
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,839
such an advantage

1040
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,520
right the developers the people who who

1041
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,839
who know how to write software code they

1042
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,760
also know the infrastructure side of

1043
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,400
things

1044
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,359
you know the firewalls and the networks

1045
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,119
the server side of things

1046
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,320
when they know a little bit of

1047
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,079
everything and they come into cyber

1048
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,599
security

1049
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,320
they have such a great advantage because

1050
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,760
it's very easy for them to

1051
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,760
understand and they know the mistakes

1052
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,160
that when you're in that job that a lot

1053
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,200
of people make

1054
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,040
and that is where you will know the

1055
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,680
weakness so i say

1056
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,800
have a general solid understanding

1057
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,440
of the different aspects of i.t or

1058
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,520
computer or networking

1059
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,079
and then depending on what you do i

1060
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,160
think there are different courses you

1061
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:38,960
take

1062
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,400
and i personally think our

1063
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:46,160
our pwk class for example is a very good

1064
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,880
foundational training don't do it just

1065
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,000
to get assert

1066
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,400
do it for the training and the third is

1067
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,640
only a way to evidence the fact that you

1068
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,079
have mastered the knowledge

1069
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,560
and the skills and uh if you have that

1070
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,599
and because when you interview for a job

1071
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:06,480
what are the employers looking for

1072
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,760
they're looking for a

1073
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:10,000
problem solver they're not just looking

1074
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:11,599
for what you have done

1075
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,839
they're looking for what you can do the

1076
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:15,359
things they don't even know

1077
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,599
what they will run into so you want to

1078
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:18,880
be able to demonstrate

1079
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,760
you are a great problem solver you are a

1080
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,880
fast learner

1081
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,359
and you always want to learn those kind

1082
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:27,920
of a characteristic of a person

1083
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,000
is really important at least when we

1084
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,960
interview

1085
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,560
we look for people who are passionate

1086
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,640
about what they do we look for people

1087
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,000
who actually have

1088
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,480
failed so they know and they have tried

1089
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,280
harder

1090
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,240
and that to us is actually a great

1091
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,200
characteristic

1092
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,839
of a person

1093
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:49,040
amazing uh i think you've answered some

1094
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,079
of the questions

1095
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,960
already but uh there is one i would like

1096
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,440
to

1097
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:56,880
also say ask over here is

1098
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,359
how do you motivate yourself in the

1099
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:00,560
initial steps

1100
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,280
of cyber security i assume the person is

1101
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,960
referring to you know initial failures

1102
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,160
and how do we keep themselves motivated

1103
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,319
um you know that is a really good

1104
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:12,640
question and i go back

1105
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,440
to this woman i literally just talked to

1106
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,200
last week because

1107
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,359
she knew no i.t i mean other than she

1108
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:24,160
you know she is a a computer she uses

1109
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,119
computer for

1110
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,200
for work in terms of you know like what

1111
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,760
we all do but she has never had the i.t

1112
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,760
job but then she just said you know i

1113
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,480
want to get oscp i want to take pwk

1114
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,400
and anybody working at offset can do

1115
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:38,480
that you know is the benefits we offer

1116
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:38,880
you know

1117
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,760
you get to do that for free and when she

1118
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:42,720
first looked at

1119
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:46,160
the pwk syllabus she said oh my god

1120
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,240
it was so hard because i realized i knew

1121
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,560
nothing i knew nothing and it was really

1122
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,280
hard

1123
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,760
and in this case she had other

1124
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,400
colleagues

1125
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,119
from offset and who gave her the

1126
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,480
guidance to say

1127
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,160
okay go to learn some networking

1128
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,560
start with there whether it's watching

1129
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,160
linkedin videos

1130
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,440
and the word take a class at comptia

1131
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,640
a plus get the basic training and from

1132
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:13,040
there

1133
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,960
learn some basic linux and windows and

1134
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,720
privilege escalation

1135
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,160
and there are a lot of different

1136
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,920
resources out there

1137
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,960
and in three four months she was ready

1138
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,319
to take pwk

1139
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,480
so you know and she did that on top of a

1140
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,119
full-time job so what they taught me

1141
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:33,760
is that when you are really beginning

1142
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,359
and i actually know that from quite a

1143
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:35,839
few

1144
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:38,560
hackers that in six months to one one

1145
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,200
year

1146
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,280
they became one of the top hackers on

1147
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,040
the hacker one platform

1148
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,359
and many of them and several several of

1149
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:46,400
them are actually in

1150
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,440
india and they all said they met a

1151
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:50,560
friend

1152
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,880
that was ahead of them and it was really

1153
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:53,599
good

1154
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:56,079
and that got them interested and it was

1155
00:42:56,079 --> 00:42:57,040
on the side

1156
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:00,079
cheering them on and giving them um

1157
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,480
the advice and giving them a helping

1158
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:04,640
hand so i will say is that when you

1159
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,920
first start out

1160
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,960
find someone who is like a mentor and uh

1161
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,200
who can give you that guidance and

1162
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,880
what's really wonderful about cyber

1163
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:13,760
security

1164
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,160
is that there's so many communities out

1165
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,599
there and many people

1166
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,800
in the community are so passionate about

1167
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:21,920
giving back

1168
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,000
so join one of those community

1169
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:24,960
communities

1170
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:27,760
and ask people if you're stuck ask

1171
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,440
people where you can start

1172
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,359
and all i want to say is that if you

1173
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:33,440
have the desire to learn

1174
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,839
in three four months you'll be ready to

1175
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:37,359
take one of those

1176
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:39,359
people consider such a difficult course

1177
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:41,440
which is our pwk

1178
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,760
but i'm telling you i know a woman first

1179
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,359
hand in four months

1180
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,000
she was ready and she did that on top of

1181
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,200
a full-time job

1182
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,440
and if she can do that i like to think

1183
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:52,720
many people can do

1184
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,119
so if you want to do it go for it and

1185
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:57,839
don't give up

1186
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:01,839
well uh ning that was beautifully said

1187
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:04,560
uh we are running out of time but i'll

1188
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,160
just take one last question

1189
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,440
uh from angelina uh

1190
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,359
when is the right time to take

1191
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,599
certifications in cyber security

1192
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,640
is it during the internship or it's

1193
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,240
you know when after you have certain

1194
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,079
number of years of experience

1195
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,560
this is something that she's constantly

1196
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:23,280
asked

1197
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,960
uh by her students

1198
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,839
um you know i think if in terms of

1199
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:31,280
certifications

1200
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,720
if you if you want to get it because

1201
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:38,319
it you know it helps your resume you can

1202
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:40,079
get it anytime

1203
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,400
and you know we have high school

1204
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,480
students who get our oscp

1205
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,839
or oswe certifications

1206
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:49,839
but you ask yourself why you want to get

1207
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:51,680
a certification is that because you want

1208
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,119
to demonstrate that you have

1209
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,839
mastered some skills or is that because

1210
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,680
you want to build your resume so you can

1211
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,319
go

1212
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,880
and apply for a job and to be they're a

1213
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:02,160
little bit different

1214
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,400
if you have the good certifications such

1215
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,760
as oscp

1216
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:08,400
i think in a lot of situations it gets

1217
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,319
you an interview

1218
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,880
you know many of them could get a job

1219
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,079
will everybody

1220
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,640
be able to get a job not necessarily

1221
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:18,000
because these days it depends

1222
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,760
on what job you're trying to get for

1223
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,319
example penetration testing

1224
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:23,760
i think people should have the

1225
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,640
expectation that you can't get a pen

1226
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,599
test job

1227
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,240
fresh out of college with no work

1228
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:31,200
experience

1229
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,560
as a system admin or some kind of other

1230
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,760
i.t job because pentest you are

1231
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,480
testing people who do those kind of work

1232
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,079
and if you have had a few years of

1233
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:42,880
experience

1234
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,200
you will know so much more and those

1235
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,200
things are hard to gain

1236
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,359
from just reading books or even reading

1237
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:50,319
blogs

1238
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:52,560
but you can get other kind of a cyber

1239
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:53,839
security job

1240
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,560
uh as a cyber operator whether it's a

1241
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,880
stock analyst security analyst

1242
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:02,560
and there you know when you go in yes so

1243
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,079
you know you have a certification it

1244
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:05,839
gets you into the door

1245
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:08,319
but people are also want to know like i

1246
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:09,440
said earlier

1247
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:11,040
are you a good problem solver they're

1248
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,560
going to give you questions or they may

1249
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:14,000
even give you a machine to work

1250
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,800
on they want to know can you actually

1251
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,119
solve problems and think on your feet

1252
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:20,800
and they want to know if you have the

1253
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,400
right kind of attitude

1254
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:25,119
you know are you a good learner because

1255
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,160
in security

1256
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,480
every problem is different is not doing

1257
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,720
something repetitive over and over again

1258
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,280
you need to be able to solve problems

1259
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,359
creatively and think on your feet

1260
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,760
and that is what people are looking for

1261
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,119
when they look for

1262
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,720
cyber security candidates so

1263
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,599
the certifications in the way is one way

1264
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:47,599
to show you have that

1265
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:50,000
but another way is that you have to be

1266
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,280
able to demonstrate

1267
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,960
on your feet so take the certifications

1268
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,319
as an example to learn those skills

1269
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:01,119
and that's why i say don't do it just do

1270
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,920
the exam

1271
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,240
because you literally drop yourself the

1272
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:05,760
chance to learn

1273
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,560
and learn those skills a will shine

1274
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:09,119
through

1275
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:11,839
and then if you have a certification on

1276
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,359
top of that

1277
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,200
that's where you can nail it that's

1278
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,399
where you get into the door

1279
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:24,160
thank you so much ning i'm sure the

1280
