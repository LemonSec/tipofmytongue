found founder of uh saiware and suhas is

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,800
senior vp at ajah cyber security

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,119
burgess uh is also joining us for this

10
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:32,719
interesting panel from reactive to

11
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:33,520
proactive

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,040
operationalizing your threat intel uh so

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,520
yeah over to you akshat to moderate the

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,840
panel and ask some challenging questions

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,160
uh this time to burgess who's on the

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,600

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,960
so uh i think i'll start with uh

29
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,720
suhas first and then by this i'll move

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,080
on to you so

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,920
today we are going to discuss about

32
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,400
threat intel in terms of proactivity in

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,840
terms of reactive

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,080
in terms of how do we

35
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,479
operationalize the threat intel which

36
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,400
has become a commodity in

37
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,479
recent times spatially post-covered if

38
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,680
we see

39
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,040
things are like moving whether it's

40
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,119
solar events whether exchange attack

41
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:36,320
whether it's

42
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,840
hundreds of things let's not go in each

43
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,520
one of them but intel has become a

44
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,079
commodity

45
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,640
now and it's becoming a problem for each

46
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,920
of the companies

47
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,040
to uh utilize it operationalize it and

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,560
make use of it so

49
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,320
so as based on your experience like you

50
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,079
have been in different hats in last few

51
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:52,880
years

52
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,680
you have seen a wide spectrum of things

53
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,119
we have seen iot space we have seen

54
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,240
multiple space

55
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,479
so wanted to know your thought process

56
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,759
on uh

57
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,320
how can we make the overall intel

58
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,640
journey proactive

59
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,000
so thanks sasha uh hybrids so one

60
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,640
uh important aspect when we are talking

61
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,120
with

62
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,480
multiple cios and csos it is coming up

63
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,520
you need to move from saw to cdc this is

64
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,120
one big trend we are seeing

65
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,959
so if you say three four years back

66
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,879
everybody was talking like say i need to

67
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:25,760
monitor

68
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,040
all my blocks i need to integrate all my

69
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,200
infrastructure components applications

70
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,040
whatever is there in my ecosystem i need

71
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,000
to monitor

72
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,120
and after that people will monitor alert

73
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,519
and

74
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,160
i will respond on that now scenario is

75
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,120
very different

76
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,280
so most of customers are asking about

77
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,800
offensive security

78
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,840
so i don't have time to wait

79
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,840
till the attack happens i need to have

80
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,760
some intelligence beforehand

81
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,319
and i need to have offensive security

82
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,680
team members in my team

83
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,760
so initially if you see combination was

84
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,000
like say some stock analyst or sock

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,720
managers

86
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,599
we used to deploy in song now scenarios

87
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,360
are changing i need to a combination of

88
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,040
offensive security guys

89
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,159
then sim architect as well as si manuel

90
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:10,879
space

91
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,879
so that paradigm has been changed

92
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:13,920
significantly

93
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,519
that is the one trend which we are

94
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,120
saying soft to

95
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,200
cdc cyber difference centers that is

96
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,400
what we are seeing

97
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,800
at most of the places second this is

98
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,599
like

99
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,200
devices perspective everything is

100
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,120
connected now and said

101
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,480
from your health care devices from your

102
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,480
say ot device says i want to devices

103
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,080
everything is getting changed

104
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,280
a lot of data is getting generated so

105
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,879
last week we were working with one of

106
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,519
the large connected devices company

107
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:44,400
so their per unit transactions or alerts

108
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,319
with 2.7 billion

109
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,519
that is a huge number and when we were

110
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,959
analyzing that part so

111
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,280
most of the attacks were in different

112
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,480
shields so

113
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,000
when we are talking about the devices

114
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,080
space attacks on reverse engineering

115
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,200
attacks on devices

116
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,400
they covered everything now getting

117
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,920
everything at one place

118
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,799
and capturing intelligence that is

119
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:12,879
important aspect and that's why

120
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,680
we are more keen on people are adopting

121
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,798
threat intelligence

122
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,959
so whenever we are talking or you know

123
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,918
gartner or

124
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:22,800
or when they are putting up what are the

125
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,400
major things in offensive security

126
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,080
threat intelligence threat hunting and

127
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,680
policing these are the

128
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,320
which together in that space third

129
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,919
intelligence is the major thing which

130
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:33,040
plays lot of

131
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,400
uh bigger bigger roles to detect and

132
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,440
alert systems

133
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,600
in beforehand something goes wrong a big

134
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,880
way

135
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,720
okay perfect thanks thanks i think

136
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,919
that's a good

137
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,000
uh insights which you shared like the

138
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,160
stock versus cdc how that stock versus

139
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,919
cdc concept is moving

140
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,639
and how we as a industry has to align uh

141
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,160
as the

142
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,479
industry is moving towards it uh let me

143
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:57,199
jump to

144
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,240
uh mr burgess uh sir so you have been

145
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,199
on the other side of the table like uh

146
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,600
as a cso of large telecom then

147
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,080
uh being in big four you get to see

148
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,520
different industries different sector

149
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,520
various things which are happening

150
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,039
how do you think like uh anyone today

151
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,639
and i'm covering everything here not

152
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,479
only a cso not only a company

153
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:21,440
but me being a security analyst a sock

154
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,880
l1 because i want to

155
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,039
hear it from their angle that what what

156
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,560
they should be doing

157
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,400
to start kind of

158
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,759
understanding this intel world how they

159
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:34,160
start

160
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,560
moving towards proactive part of the

161
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,360
entire

162
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,160
security story entire predictive part of

163
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,320
the security story so if you can share

164
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,360
some

165
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,160
lights or vision on how me starting when

166
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,840
i'm starting my career as a stock l1

167
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,800
analyst

168
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,600
in any industry any sector how do i

169
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,000
adopt

170
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,400
these things and how do i kind of become

171
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,000
master of it

172
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,520
thank you akshat always happy to

contribute like in any warfare it's

174
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,440
based on deception

175
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,880
and intelligence right whether it's

176
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,120
physical warfare or cyber warfare

177
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,080
and timely intelligence makes a big

178
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,120
difference

179
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,720
uh to you being able to either thought

180
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,720
yourself from the enemy attack or being

181
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,240
a victim

182
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,240
uh take an example as you mentioned

183
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,800
rightly daily there's some amount of

184
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
some yesterday microsoft in a new patch

185
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,080
or solarwinds happened

186
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,080
and some attacks happen from the this

187
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,280
sector

188
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,440
i think it's all about the bent of mind

189
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,840
you know if i'm an l1 analyst and i will

190
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,240
only

191
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,720
do okay something came and do my job and

192
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:33,759
then that's it

193
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,240
but if i have a curious mind oh that's

194
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,759
attacks happening how can that affect to

195
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,360
me what are the iocs can i know is my

196
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,199
company secured you know what is the apd

197
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,080
number can i

198
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,240
it's that inquisitive that attackers

199
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,280
mentality

200
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,759
you cannot be a good defense guy if you

201
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,680
don't know how to sense an attack and do

202
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,960
an attacking yourself

203
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,479
and i think it's a state of mentality

204
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,240
often of an l1 guy he could be in the

205
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,120
blue team

206
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,639
but if he does not think like an

207
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,639
attacker the

208
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,240
football parents the attacker will run

209
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,000
rings around him and sort of you know do

210
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,880
the goal

211
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,759
so from that perspective clearly the

212
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:06,960
bend of mind

213
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,880
uh the attack mentality is very

214
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,319
important for

215
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,599
l1 analysts to think

216
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,759
how will he ensure that the intelligence

217
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:17,599
is timely used for his perspective

218
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,280
that's my point of view

219
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,039
perfect perfect i think there was an

220
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,400
echo in between somewhere

221
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,680
uh so swaz let me jump to you and ask uh

222
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,360
one more uh story around how do you feel

223
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,880
like uh

224
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,440
the cross sector intel is is it getting

225
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,039
really

226
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,080
operationalized and because you interact

227
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,479
with

228
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:41,520
so many sectors so do you think

229
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,520
there's a role of cross-sector

230
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,479
helping each other benefiting each other

231
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,720
bfsi working only with bfs io bank

232
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,400
working only with bank not even with f

233
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,360
and s and i

234
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,440
so do you think that somewhere that

235
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,479
cross-sector

236
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,599
harmony in this entire world has to come

237
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,720
together

238
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,280
on the proactive part of defense system

239
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,120
so that's not even limited to intel

240
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,639
but the proactive part of the entire

241
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,479
defensing system or overall defensing

242
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:09,199
part of it

243
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:11,360
like all of us have to come together to

244
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,960
fight the bad actors

245
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,400
so and they're working together as a

246
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,120
group so anything you see as a trend

247
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,080
anything you see

248
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,919
that we should be doing or things are

249
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,280
moving towards that

250
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,919
yeah so uh there are a couple of

251
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,759
examples that simply happen so one part

252
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,879
is like say

253
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,680
health care industry so we are saying so

254
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,320
even today morning's news is about

255
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,000
many countries targeted on vaccine

256
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,320
manufacturers that is the one case

257
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,599
second case is like

258
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:40,880
similar type of attacks has been

259
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,360
happened in last week on airlines

260
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,080
and few attacks has happened on ot part

261
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,959
so you might have

262
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,880
seen a large article day before

263
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,640
yesterday where

264
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,120
a particular state has been targeting uh

265
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,000
indian

266
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,480
uh great power uh plants and control

267
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,120
systems

268
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,040
so these are the three classic examples

269
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,480
so if you say

270
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,160
almost three are coming in critical

271
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,519
infrastructures national critical

272
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,480
infrastructure and

273
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,760
it has huge impact on human lives

274
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,399
and their day-to-day work part so if you

275
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,959
say

276
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,959
attack pattern so everything is up for

277
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,240
health care all the critical

278
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,000
infrastructure ics ot

279
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,320
that is there that part is common

280
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,839
although industry is different

281
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,600
similar stuff is for the power and grid

282
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,440
their control systems are comes under in

283
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,720
ics part

284
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,440
and third piece is the airlines also lot

285
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,200
of sensor technology they are using

286
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,519
and complete aviation power control

287
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:32,399
systems

288
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,160
that also has been targeted in single

289
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,240
industry now attack vector

290
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,240
threat intelligence across all the three

291
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,000
part sign prediction part

292
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,399
so now there is another trend which we

293
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,560
are seeing cyber prediction

294
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,880
so with laptop uh big data at the back

295
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,480
end and analytics

296
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,800
and using all these threat intelligence

297
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,399
for or across the industry

298
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,240
that is getting on common patterns and

299
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,600
it is helping

300
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,240
another example is like for the citizen

301
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,480
cyber prediction for cyber time space

302
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,399
so there is also lot of things which are

303
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,480
coming up as part of like say human

304
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,600
behavioral patterns

305
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,680
people are using social media those

306
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,720
parts are also com

307
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,680
some parts coming into other sectors so

308
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,680
sector-wise scenarios might be different

309
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,120
use cases might be different but attack

310
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:17,440
patterns or intelligence patterns are

311
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,000
similar and interlinked sometimes so ics

312
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,600
and ot is the classic examples

313
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,040
which i would recommend perfect perfect

314
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,240
um i'd like to add there it is clearly

315
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,200
collaboration

316
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,800
you know it doesn't have to be matter of

317
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,399
bang non-bank

318
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,399
uh collaboration between the cso company

319
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,079
which i think is really there now

320
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,720
uh one thread comes in a few seconds

321
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,800
cesars are all over the place iocs are

322
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,680
shared

323
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,720
attacks so i think that is clearly their

324
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,560
informal channel of collaboration is

325
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,240
really active some of you will be in our

326
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,440
whatsapp groups

327
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,640
uh the signal groups that really sector

328
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,600
works and

329
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
one person asks for help and the enough

330
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,800
of five guys to

331
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,480
sort of give the right information which

332
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,320
was not there five years ago

333
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,079
uh that so that i think in the indian

334
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,160
sector i'm sure some other places

335
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,560
uh the collaboration between csos is

336
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,240
just fantastic the amount of whatsapp

337
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,519
groups the amount of

338
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:11,680
intel uh i think that's really helped

339
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,800
propagate

340
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,959
right timely until the right place

341
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,320
irrespective of

342
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,600
official channels of communication yes

343
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,880
and i think i think i can

344
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,399
i eco you and uh

345
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,040
we see this trend as you said across

346
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,519
like

347
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,320
not only in india even in middle east uh

348
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,200
where

349
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,800
we talk to various csos and various

350
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,959
whatsapp groups literally even ioc

351
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,440
shared even in arabics

352
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,120
and even in us and the cross sector is

353
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,079
need of the hour

354
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,079
and cross sector is happening and will

355
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,440
continue happening and

356
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,440
i think somewhere regulators will also

357
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,720
start playing that role

358
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,519
the moment they start uh importance of

359
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:52,000
that

360
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,240
so it may become or will become

361
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,399
eventually where regulators are also

362
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,519
uh helping each and every one in sharing

363
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,200
that on a lighter note actually very

364
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,720
often i get your thread intel's from

365
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,440
other people before you send it to me

366
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,440
so it means it's working your company is

367
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,480
doing a great job

368
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,040
thank you so uh but just let me come to

369
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,680
you and uh

370
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,440
let me switch the gear a little bit from

371
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,360
this side to the cloud part of it

372
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,000
so uh there is a buzz around cloud we

373
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,959
are saying like

374
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,040
traditionally people say that india as a

375
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,480
country runs four or five

376
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,399
years behind in adoption of the new

377
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,720
technology whether it's 2g 3g 4g 5g or

378
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,480
even clouded option

379
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,200
on the cloud adoption eventually has to

380
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,680
happen

381
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,800
right in steps as a slow

382
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,760
or faster pace depends on which sector

383
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,920
you belong to how compliant it is

384
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,279
how regulated it is for from a cs1 from

385
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,440
a big four consulting point of view

386
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,839
what what kind of risk you see in the

387
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,519
cloud movement and how

388
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,880
the overall intel and proactive approach

389
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,839
can help reducing or mitigating those

390
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:58,720
risk

391
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,600
which people have as a fear oh no no no

392
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,440
i should not be moving to cloud

393
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,279
i'll next i get attacked because they

394
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,560
feel cloud is s3

395
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,680
and s3 is the biggest vulnerable

396
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,720
stuff in cloud so what's your experience

397
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,160
there and how do you think the proactive

398
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,000
approach can help mitigating

399
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,959
or making that fear go away for moving

400
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,480
to cloud for many of the indian

401
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,440
organization including bfsi or non-bfsr

402
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,040
so clearly cloud is more than s3 as you

403
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,120
mentioned and clearly cloud is imminent

404
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,040
uh you also write that many people have

405
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,800
hurried journey to the cloud rightfully

406
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,480
so because covet came in and

407
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,720
you didn't have the people so one thing

408
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,079
the cloud clearly

409
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,920
rules over everybody else is the speed

410
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,760
the the part of elasticity

411
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,320
which it can happen it just needs a

412
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,560
thoughtful process to migrate the cloud

413
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,399
if you have a cloud first strategy is

414
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,000
that really working

415
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,079
have you thought through cloud is

416
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,079
somebody it's a data center right

417
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,720
have you done that very well if you have

418
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,240
that thought process

419
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,000
and you have the right security checks

420
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,320
and balances of getting to the cloud

421
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,760
and if you have either a dual cloud

422
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,760
approach a hybrid cloud approach or

423
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,600
all there on the cloud and production on

424
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,880
whatever if you have

425
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,639
thought through that well cloud journey

426
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,079
could be a much more

427
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:13,120
certifying uh peaceful

428
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,560
uh helpful journey if on the other hand

429
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,639
you have not done that probably in just

430
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,399
a ad hoc reaction

431
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,880
or someone said so someone read so

432
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,800
someone said is cheaper it does not have

433
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,760
to be cheaper

434
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,600
it may become much more prudent in the

435
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,920
long run so i think a careful thought

436
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:30,880
through process

437
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,440
of spending the right introspection

438
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,480
saying why cloud

439
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,800
how cloud when cloud can make all the

440
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,240
difference but yeah you're right cloud

441
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,120
is imminent

442
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,760
for the future it just depends how well

443
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,120
you get there

444
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,600
correct correct so here uh actually two

445
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:46,720
are double on

446
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
this point so another trend which we are

447
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,959
seeing a lot of adoption for cloud

448
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,199
native assignments or capabilities

449
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:55,279
so there are about major eight to twelve

450
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,639
uh players

451
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,360
those are providing these services and

452
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,440
initially when we were talking say

453
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,120
five years back so it was like there

454
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,519
were two three on premise assigned place

455
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,240
where there

456
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,560
so now people are changing so largely

457
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,680
for the

458
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,800
sme bank or organization side so they

459
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,720
are adopting for this cloud native

460
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,959
assignment so so that is one good thing

461
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,880
which we are seeing in india or apac

462
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,040
region so from the cloud assignment

463
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,320
second piece is like if like what you

464
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:24,800
said

465
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,399
if we do proper strategy on cloud

466
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,480
security fundamental part is like you

467
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,160
need to have cloud native security

468
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,720
that needs to connect first whenever you

469
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,320
are taking any cloud setup or you are

470
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,079
hosting whether it is large organization

471
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:36,320
or

472
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,639
it is a small one instance you need to

473
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,079
have those things right

474
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,399
rightly set in the foundation itself

475
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,920
native security controls

476
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,399
your all the governance compliance space

477
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,759
and third one is like

478
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,600
whatever you are doing a regulatory

479
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,519
driven part should be

480
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,639
mandatory made in particular region

481
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,399
maybe in india maybe in middle east or

482
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,880
maybe u.s so these three things

483
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,120
are acquired necessary for cloud

484
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,000
adoption and

485
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,199
securing its entire end-to-end

486
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,800
ecosystem has been hosted in proper

487
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
environment that is needed

488
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,040
perfect perfect and let me stick with

489
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,320
you second inhibition

490
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,160
and this going forward is probably the

491
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,000
only other inhibition of

492
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,680
going in the bad is the ability of

493
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,040
trained manpower

494
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,320
you know most people uh in all phases of

495
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,360
life

496
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,600
cloud is a new thing so while you can

497
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,360
talk cloud cloud but actually going to

498
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,120
the natives of

499
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,600
securing the cloud quantifying the cloud

500
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,759
and configuring on the cloud

501
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,480
is a big uh sort of challenge if you

502
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,920
don't have the right people and support

503
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,320
to get there

504
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,800
right we'll see that as a fear do you

505
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,440
still see

506
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,759
that as a barrier do you still see that

507
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:46,720
as a big no

508
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,040
no no i will not move sorry not for next

509
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,199
five years not for next two years

510
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,560
people are moving but it is slow see

511
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,040
so what is happening uh some places

512
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,399
people are doing pilot but

513
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,600
what they are just checking whether

514
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,759
in the flow or as part of digital

515
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,119
transformation journey they are trying

516
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,640
for the few pilots

517
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,919
but getting right people on ground to do

518
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,520
all the security because pure insurance

519
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,240
is like

520
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,559
what budget said if you are not setting

521
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,000
it with properly native security

522
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,439
controls no right talent

523
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,919
now majorly hard two or three cloud

524
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:20,720
players are

525
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,959
playing transformation journalists and

526
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:25,039
there is a lack of

527
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:27,039
skill the manpower people are there from

528
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,480
the infrastructure point

529
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,760
whatever work they have done they are

530
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,160
doing posting but doing all the detail

531
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,600
cloud foundation security

532
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,200
all your advanced cloud native control

533
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,600
security so that part

534
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,799
somehow we need to be skilled we started

535
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,720
that journey in india specifically

536
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,360
hardly you will get say 100 guys who has

537
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,720
done this native and advanced security

538
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,720
controls implementation properly

539
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,360
so that we need to create and support

540
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,280
this entire transformations

541
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,360
sure uh but if you want to add something

542
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,640
i think you'll be unmuted

543
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,320
i just thought yeah thanks for your

544
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,280
smart idea uh and also could be

545
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,200
a question we ask ourselves what are we

546
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,960
doing to empower the cloud journey

547
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,559
how many guys are we training what

548
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,160
session are we being on awareness

549
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,000
uh to ensuring don't worry you know you

550
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,679
have the right hand holding the fear of

551
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,520
unknown always slows down progress right

552
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,120
because you don't know what's there

553
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,799
but the questions i would ask myself and

554
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,240
we should all ask is

555
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,080
what are we doing to allay the fear of

556
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,280
the unknown

557
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,320
right exactly

558
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,600
so but let me state to you

559
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,679
another thing which i wanted to check is

560
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:32,559
uh post covet like the moment all of us

561
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,080
went into lockdown exactly i think for

562
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,919
most of us last travel was this nalcon

563
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:36,480
goa

564
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,679
if i remember correctly and i think

565
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:42,640
since then we were not traveling but we

566
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,919
stick to our home and everything so

567
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,039
suddenly everything become

568
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,039
work from home right and many of the

569
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,799
organizations in india especially banks

570
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,320
and all they did not even have laptop

571
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,600
with all the employees

572
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,039
so where i'm taking my question is

573
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,640
towards endpoint security

574
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,400
because at the end of the day my laptop

575
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,320
my device my phone where

576
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,080
i started working to work for my company

577
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,000
for my office applications for my

578
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,200
work applications which probably none of

579
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,880
the organizations or many of the css did

580
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,600
not even get

581
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,080
proper time to implement it because if

582
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,280
covert was not there

583
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,480
they would have done this kind of

584
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,480
exercise in two years but kovid made

585
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,280
them do this

586
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,440
transition in two months probably with

587
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,799
minimal disruptions

588
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,600
so where do you feel that is there a

589
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,400
scope

590
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,600
that on the clouds endpoint security

591
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,160
what happened post covered a are we

592
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,200
taking enough care

593
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,520
b how can we be proactive by

594
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,679
operationalizing

595
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,160
the intel aspect of it to be more secure

596
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,840
in the overall endpoint security

597
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,160
where everything is kind of work from

598
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,480
home semi byod

599
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,720
multiple combinations which people never

600
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,840
thought that will be moving so fast in

601
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,559
2020

602
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,320
you're right akshat what had to be done

603
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,160
had to be done right got done and

604
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,120
i think the true value of the see so uh

605
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,400
to a value of the captain

606
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,600
it comes in adversity the ship is

607
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,720
sailing nobody realizes but when the

608
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,840
ship's going down

609
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,480
so true value of the ciso and the cio

610
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,400
really came out during this time i did

611
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
16 sessions of moderating

612
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,640
fireside chats with about 800 people

613
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,159
during this whole time the learnings of

614
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,200
these were

615
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,960
said it has moved from a business

616
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,880
enabler to a value creator

617
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,960
okay if it was not there probably the

618
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,240
business guys would have been home and

619
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,679
unable to work

620
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,880
and uh yes security moved to the edge uh

621
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,880
people did ubers and olafs to send

622
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,320
workstations laptops

623
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,400
whatever was available rent tire bag

624
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,120
borrow people paid money to companies to

625
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,640
uh to employees who use their own home

626
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,480
laptops imagine taking some job of

627
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,840
saying i want for the office but my

628
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,600
company is paying me and i had all those

629
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,760
cases people saying but clearly now the

630
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,799
time take pause

631
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,679
reflect uh see the digital advances

632
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:48,640
happened

633
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,159
i we may have may not have gone the

634
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,880
cloud but has that journey been secure

635
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,640
and it's a good time to introspect

636
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,880
reflect and make corrections do before

637
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,440
somebody else forces you to make it

638
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,280
correct perfect first you want to add

639
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,640
anything on this aspect

640
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,960
yeah so to continue on that part uh most

641
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,080
of the organizations say

642
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,320
in india 90 percent more than 90 percent

643
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,280
we can say

644
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,240
adoption was good people started working

645
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:12,799
home

646
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,880
hardly uh any organization has not

647
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,080
enabled their biod

648
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,360
and remote work facilities so here

649
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:23,200
risk from the remote desktop or endpoint

650
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,080
or security edr specifically or you can

651
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,440
say xdrps

652
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,840
so that is much needed so we need to

653
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:31,600
look out at least once

654
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,640
in a quarter whether my xdr journey is

655
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:35,760
really secure

656
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,440
whether all my end points has been

657
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,679
really covered all the assets on the

658
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,679
cloud whatever i have posted

659
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:44,400
risk assessment on those points also has

660
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,120
been covered

661
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,159
so primary

662
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:50,159
risk assessment for your inter part and

663
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:51,200
x data coverage

664
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,559
that we need to measure correctly

665
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,120
it will give us lot of intelligence how

666
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,880
many loopholes are in my system

667
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,039
and what are the improvement plans i

668
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,000
need to consider

669
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,400
that is the important piece perfect i

670
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,840
think we have six more minutes

671
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,520
uh meanwhile are there any questions

672
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,760
from any of the audience

673
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,400
please just type in the chat uh

674
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,240
meanwhile i'm just moving on to one more

675
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:14,960
uh

676
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,440
input which i needed from your budget is

677
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,679
is

678
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,600
from the entire solarwinds story which

679
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,919
shook all of us because the kind of long

680
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,039
impact it had

681
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,520
and and reaching from there to oh

682
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,280
probably in turn had a weak password

683
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,039
right so um how we all of us

684
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,960
is there something proactively can we do

685
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,640
because where are we lacking is in the

686
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,600
actions

687
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,960
everyone knows that this is my bullet

688
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,720
list everyone knows this is my hygiene

689
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,520
list

690
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,080
but somehow that hygiene is not followed

691
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,200
up

692
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,919
how what all of us as a like

693
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,159
organizations as a company as a cso as a

694
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,679
captain as a cio as a

695
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,720
cto as a devsecops

696
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,720
devsecops head or even as a developer or

697
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,640
as a intern

698
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,919
because what happens i'll tell you the

699
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:01,919
real practical ground problem

700
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,600
everyone knows that one plus one equal

701
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,440
to two everyone knows this is my hygiene

702
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,960
everyone know that i am not supposed to

703
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,640
do this everyone knows i am not supposed

704
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,039
to

705
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,559
have this weak password everyone knows

706
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,880
that i am not supposed to give a ci cd

707
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,600
pipeline to an intern

708
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,480
what all do i do what all should i be

709
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,000
doing

710
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,919
proactively because my focus today is

711
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,360
proactive part of the things

712
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,240
that another solar one does not happen

713
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:26,960
so i'll i'll say

714
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,480
i'll start with the captain right you

715
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,480
ask what the captain i think it's the c

716
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,280
source job and responsibility to set out

717
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:33,679
the

718
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,360
priority for the company because if he

719
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,960
does not do that everybody else will do

720
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,919
what they want you know

721
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:39,360
in a sinking ship or a ship going

722
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,880
through a storm you've got to have clear

723
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,400
command control you cannot say ah baby

724
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,520
karo of baby karo

725
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,840
so the cso's a bid to give the clear

726
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,760
mandates with the torture from the ceo

727
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,240
saying

728
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,240
i will say these things debate fight but

729
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,159
once that order the command is given

730
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,679
everyone yours is not to question why

731
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,360
also just do and die as they say

732
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,200
so not die hopefully but come out of

733
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,760
this but that command has to be first

734
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,600
thought through by the ciso and cio

735
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,799
agreed with the ceo

736
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:05,279
and then once given what is really

737
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,400
priority because you cannot do

738
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,679
everything to everybody

739
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,520
but if it means you are in this industry

740
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,000
you secure if it's ot then secure the ot

741
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,880
line if you're in

742
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,360
uh devops and you secure the dev cycle

743
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:15,919
agile

744
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,400
but whatever you agree on i think you

745
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,919
first need to prioritize

746
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,919
there's so much things to do and

747
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,360
everything is important

748
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,440
it's clearly for the seesaw to mandate

749
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,039
and say what is really important during

750
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:28,559
this point of time for the next three

751
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:29,039
months

752
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,360
we call it vital essential desirable

753
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,480
what is whitetail

754
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,000
what is hygiene has to be done in the

755
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,159
next three months then

756
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,000
uh essential okay three to six months

757
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,080
and then desirable but what's vital

758
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,640
what's survival right now that priority

759
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,559
has to be said by the ceo cesonc

760
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,880
and the ceo and then taking it forward i

761
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,559
think that captain's direction during

762
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,640
these tough times is so very important

763
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,080
otherwise everyone will do what they

764
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,159
think is important i agree

765
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,320
agree really appreciate that those

766
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,760
thoughts there's a question which has

767
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,080
come

768
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,320
from in the chat in audience is in a

769
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,840
season opinion

770
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,600
on the digital transformation that

771
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,279
happened during covet times

772
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,919
are they satisfied that it was secure uh

773
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:09,440
i'll had a couple of points from couple

774
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:09,919
of uh

775
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,760
comments from my side and then and i let

776
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,840
suhas or burgess any one of them had

777
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,200
as buddhist already pointed out like

778
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,919
whatever happened had to happen they did

779
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:21,279
it in two months they did it in two

780
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:21,760
months

781
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,520
and i think combining the vital

782
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,880
essential desirable

783
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,559
they did it with the vital part of it

784
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,320
then i'm sure all the cso started moving

785
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,840
towards the essential part of it

786
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,600
and then they started moving towards the

787
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,960
desirable part of it

788
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,000
so uh over to use uh versus

789
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,360
any one of you want to add anything on

790
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,200
this question whether you

791
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:43,200
are satisfied that i am i'm secure

792
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:47,360
yeah so here one part definitely uh

793
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,000
they are satisfied by entire digital

794
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,440
transformations where

795
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,919
many years people couldn't do that that

796
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:54,799
happened in

797
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,600
a shorter time many initiatives has been

798
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,400
rolled out

799
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,679
on immediate basis but on the

800
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,760
satisfaction phase

801
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:07,440
it is very uh so very big

802
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,240
part i would say that organizations are

803
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,000
happy that their business has not been

804
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
impacted from the business side

805
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,120
from the security side unless and until

806
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,640
uh it was not detected

807
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,159
whether attack has been happened really

808
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:24,640
or not or it was compromised

809
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,360
until the time we can say it is secure

810
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,640
another point is like

811
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,039
unless and until we do throw a review

812
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,440
third party reviews or some audits

813
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,320
around whether entire ecosystem which

814
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,159
was unable to

815
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,240
for this remote work whether it is

816
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,000
secured that we need to do unless and

817
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,080
until we run such programs

818
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,840
then only we can ensure that 100 percent

819
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,559
work from home

820
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,960
has been enabled and this digital

821
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,039
transformation is successful

822
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,520
another piece is like say whenever we

823
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,320
are uh

824
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,559
so the second question from the odc part

825
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,200
so this part we have experienced

826
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,760
so badly in past because many customers

827
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:04,840
because of their

828
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,919
sensitivity or confidentiality part very

829
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,919
critical applications were hosted

830
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,520
in particular series or of odc part

831
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,320
it was not possible to do work from home

832
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:16,720
at

833
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,360
such scenarios many so for the most

834
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,799
european and u.s customers

835
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:23,679
50 60 percent customers allowed to do uh

836
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:24,480
remote work

837
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,760
but few critical components were asked

838
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,200
to do from uh orisa's only at that time

839
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,159
proper care from the uh infrastructure

840
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,679
side has been taken care

841
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,600
but that was very limited broadly

842
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,279
majority of large organizations has

843
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,399
enabled

844
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:44,080
uh remote work versus thank you i have a

845
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,520
slight different opinion

846
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,039
what had to be done had to be done got

847
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,039
that doesn't as you said it's more

848
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,480
important what you can do now

849
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,000
i think cesar should do a pat on the

850
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
back the very fact you survived the war

851
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,080
and pandemic was no less than a war

852
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,640
each of our companies uh as a ciso when

853
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,919
you are protecting them must have been

854
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,360
through money attacks

855
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,679
you survive that onslaught partly brutal

856
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,520
partly come out whichever way

857
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,600
it's more important what you can do now

858
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,919
to ensure your journey ahead is secure

859
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,600
you know if you may have been attacked

860
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,080
not attacked partially attacked control

861
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,159
victimized ransomware come on stronger

862
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,679
recovery whatever

863
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:20,559
more important is what you do now so as

864
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,240
to secure the journey forward and that i

865
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:22,880
think will

866
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,200
determine the test of time correct let

867
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,880
me ask last question by this to you and

868
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,640
then we'll conclude

869
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,279
uh this the recent grid scenario the

870
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,520
chinese attack on national grades

871
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,799
uh railways many more and many more of

872
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,399
this might have happened

873
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,640
uh i'm taking it to the concluding point

874
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:44,960
of like intel and proactiveness part

875
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:48,159
what me as a ceso if i was a ciso what

876
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:49,279
me as a captain of

877
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,399
ship anywhere uh

878
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,039
should be having any lessons from all of

879
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,640
this which keeps on coming or

880
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,799
highlighted to us

881
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,360
how still i keep on getting i give it

882
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,960
you give it everyone gives it

883
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,200
everyone is giving it what do i do how

884
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,320
do i still

885
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:09,360
become proactive and import understand

886
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:10,960
the importance of this

887
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,320
intel because if you see many of these

888
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,039
grids

889
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,520
were not they were saved because of the

890
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,039
inter by the way

891
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,360
because they received intel in time and

892
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,880
that's how these grids were saved

893
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,440
so how do we how do we all make

894
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,000
ourselves

895
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,039
understand the importance of

896
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,279
proactiveness and intel and our board

897
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,399
and everyone so firstly i think you

898
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:36,320
have some aspiration to become a cso

899
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,080
because you keep on saying i wish i want

900
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,320
to see so i think you like a legacy

901
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,080
thanks to your intel yes resource would

902
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,840
have survived that onslaught

903
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,960
uh it's a question of not

904
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,159
today i think every board also

905
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,520
understands the importance of cyber

906
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,360
largely thanks to media and

907
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,200
uh conferences like these and many

908
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,600
others it's just a question of how long

909
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,360
do you stay in a state of ready alert

910
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,600
you can't stay in a hyper state too long

911
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,960
otherwise that itself becomes a dull

912
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,679
state

913
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,679
it just means sensitizing your people to

914
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,440
the right intelligence at the right time

915
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,240
like i said

916
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,159
every warfare decide works on

917
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,679
intelligence and deception that's the

918
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,120
basics of any warfare

919
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,440
cyber is no difference how well you

920
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,279
deceive your enemy and how well you

921
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:17,120
are the right intel will determine

922
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,799
success or failure so

923
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,360
being on that state of paranoia working

924
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,480
on every intel

925
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,679
calmly but you know swiftly and acting

926
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:26,159
on it

927
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,679
protecting yourself the next thread

928
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:29,200
comes without

929
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,440
losing your state of alertness is the

930
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,640
survival sta

931
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,799
point from my perspective okay i'll just

932
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,559
take a question uh from the chat and

933
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,080
i'll probably try to answer it myself

934
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,880
before

935
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,039
unfliction anyone ping me that you are

936
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,080
done uh

937
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,679
so as mentioned that ciso now these days

938
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,279
use the current communication text such

939
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,960
as whatsapp to spread information about

940
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,559
threat mitigation

941
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,640
some i'm just summarizing like oh should

942
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,600
it be sharing in the

943
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,080
whatsapp group so i think here is my

944
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,720
take on this

945
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,200
let's let's divide this information in

946
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,960
two parts sensitive and insensitive

947
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,440
or public versus non-public so whatever

948
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,960
is public whatever i'm getting from the

949
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,559
public domain i should be sharing

950
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,720
on the whatsapp i should be helping

951
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,480
people to find the public information

952
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,480
which is scattered in 100 places

953
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,120
at one place no one knows that who all

954
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,720
could be there in these whatsapp groups

955
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,559
but let's come to the non-public part of

956
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:19,919
it or insensitive or

957
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,399
with sensitive information part of it

958
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:23,679
which i might be getting from my

959
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:24,559
regulators

960
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,799
which i might be getting from something

961
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:29,039
which only i should be private

962
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,720
that information we should not be

963
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,399
sharing on those whatsapp group

964
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,000
i don't know badges and swaz if you

965
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,519
agree with that point that

966
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:37,279
sensitive and non-sensitive information

967
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:40,960
in public versus non-public information

968
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,360
so us

969
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:48,799
see it has uh different

970
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:50,720
aspects when we are sharing such

971
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,799
information sometimes if it is only

972
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:53,679
informational

973
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,399
page then it is good uh but most of the

974
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:57,039
csos

975
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,080
i don't think they are sharing critical

976
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,440
client related information or

977
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,360
organization related information

978
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,519
but from the information say this is a

979
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:06,559
ioc or

980
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:08,159
this is a critical incident which we

981
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:09,919
observe recently and

982
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,440
uh that should be blocked at

983
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,360
organization level i think search type

984
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,279
of scenarios definitely we can share and

985
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,559
uh it helps to prevent

986
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,279
such type of attacks in future i think i

987
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,880
don't see any harm into that

988
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,000
but uh if somebody is by knowing

989
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,519
unknowingly if they are sharing some

990
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,080
information

991
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,880
related to our nationality classes then

992
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,440
can be

993
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,840
prevented but most of the places i have

994
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,440
never seen such type of information has

995
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,559
been passed through

996
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:40,080
i think most of us are that much natural

997
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,200
that we are not sharing

998
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,000
critically informed words tend to agree

999
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,799
sharing good

1000
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,880
information which is public in nature or

1001
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,480
channels to us to a faster reach and

1002
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,919
timely action is important

1003
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,200
yeah everything else is professional

1004
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,960
they will not share beyond that your

1005
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,039
position of maturity and respect that

1006
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,159
chair

1007
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:59,279
but sharing intelligence of common

1008
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,640
attackers just like attackers share

1009
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,600
information

1010
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,480
uh sharing proactive defense information

1011
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:05,919
amongst peers and colleagues who help

1012
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:06,399
each other

1013
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:07,840
i think is a plus point it actually

1014
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,760
helps csos in the industry

1015
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,640
[Music]

1016
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,120
really really appreciate it uh and uh

1017
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,279
thanks anthrax entire nalcon team

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,200
panel chat hopefully
