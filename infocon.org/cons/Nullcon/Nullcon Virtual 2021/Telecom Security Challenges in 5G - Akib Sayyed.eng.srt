2
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,040
next

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,080
talk uh one of the most

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,240
technical uh and the most critical

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,760
infrastructure today

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,320
that most of the nations are trying to

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,640
protect is the telecom industry

8
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:29,679
and since we are rolling out the 5g

9
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,679
infrastructure for various nations

10
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,040
globally

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,520
innovation comes with its own challenges

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,280
and weaknesses

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,760
so let's find out more on the telecom

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,800
security

15
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,680
challenges for 5g network via the

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:44,480
founder

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,680
of matrix shell technologies

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,640
akip sayad akib over to you

19
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,840
thank you anthrax let me just share my

20
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,840
screen

21
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,600
okay guys can you see my screen guys yes

22
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,559
it's visible

23
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:07,760
okay so thank you anthrax for the

24
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,880
introduction

25
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,960
so i'll be talking about the security

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,640
challenges in 5g

27
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,680
okay as we we are moving towards the 5g

28
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,280
india is gearing up for the 5g

29
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,320
technology

30
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,759
there are certain challenges that we

31
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,720
need to look at when it comes to the

32
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,960
security part but first i'll tell you

33
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,799
about me and

34
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,799
i'm working in telcon security since

35
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,040
last eight years my first talk was in

36
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,000
nalcon

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,159
and i really appreciate that nalcon gave

38
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,159
me a good platform without any

39
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:38,159
without having any initial experience in

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,040
security i thank you see my thank you

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,240
anthony chandan and the rest of the

42
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,880
nilcon team so i am a gsma member i mean

43
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,880
my company is a gsm member so i am

44
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,479
actually contributing to the foreign

45
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,759
security group as well

46
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,600
i'm founder of metric shell doing that

47
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,799
we are doing the telecom security

48
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,159
research all the time

49
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,640
and yes we are hiring whenever we

50
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,240
require some more strength anyways

51
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,520
let's go ahead what i do for the telecom

52
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,159
operator

53
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,000
i do all the telecom audits when it

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
comes to any technology like 2g

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,598
3g 4g 5g as well as penetration testing

56
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,160
of the voiceover lte fixed ims or it

57
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,360
could be air interface

58
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,239
and we have we used to do some uh tech

59
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,440
testing for the telecom operator which

60
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,520
is manually now we've automated our ss7

61
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,080
diameter and gr explanation testing

62
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,160
we also do the telecom forensic for the

63
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,200
telecom network

64
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,720
let's leave that part now and let's get

65
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,400
into the 5g now

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,840
so what exactly is a 5g uh that

67
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,920
interests us is most of the time is

68
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,959
speed

69
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,519
we started with uh 2g speed then which

70
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,920
we had 2.5 2.75

71
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,920
then 3g then i had 4g now we have the 5g

72
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,560
so 5g is claiming to be going up to 20

73
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,440
mbps

74
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,760
speed which is 10 to 100x faster than

75
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,760
what we get in the 4g

76
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,680
okay we also have the low latency

77
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,519
network okay when i say talk about the

78
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,360
low latency means uh

79
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,879
i think uh technology people do

80
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,879
understand this point about the latency

81
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:02,560
but the 5g is claiming to give one

82
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,000
millisecond latency when it

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,599
reached to the core and goes back

84
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,159
returns back from the core

85
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,400
it also claims to give a up to 10 year

86
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,080
battery life for the low power iot

87
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:12,640
device

88
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,280
using like a narrowband iot or catim

89
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,480
devices

90
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,680
also the 5g can replace the traditional

91
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,400
wire broadband like uh i'm not saying

92
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,519
about the

93
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,360
the fiber broadband but i'm talking

94
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,120
about uh i'm talking about the wireless

95
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,640
broadband wherever there is

96
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,879
not less possibility or less

97
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,480
difficulties to get the fiber

98
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,239
laid out the mission critical

99
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,840
communication is also a good part of the

100
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,159
fire of 5g because we have 5g supporting

101
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,040
uh multiple

102
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,840
technologies like uh push to talk

103
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,440
instant post to talk services

104
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,360
or some some more there are no more

105
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,959
details into that we are not looking at

106
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:47,280
this

107
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,920
right now 5g also claims to be as 4g

108
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,040
claim for the v2x

109
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,519
vehicle to everything firefighter also

110
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:54,799
giving the immersive

111
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,560
entertainment like virtual reality

112
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,319
augmented reality

113
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,159
as there is a less latency and a higher

114
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,680
speed so what is the 5g and wi-fi ge

115
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,840
from security point of view 5g

116
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,319
establishes end-to-end trust

117
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,080
when it comes to authentication

118
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,799
integrity and confidentiality

119
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,080
you might say that these points are

120
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,840
already there in 4g but

121
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,560
why we need them in a 5g again so there

122
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,600
are some issues in the 4g that actually

123
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,520
gives out the initial information like

124
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,440
your mc when it when you're transmitting

125
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,639
or you're trying to connect to the

126
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,639
network after switching on your phone

127
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,680
so 5g also prevents that by doing the

128
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,479
encryption

129
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,960
and then only revealing the identity

130
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,880
after the authentication is verified by

131
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,520
the

132
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,040
telecom network which is the home

133
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,120
telecom network also

134
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,759
5g resume removes all the assumptions

135
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,440
when it comes to safety from product or

136
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,400
process means

137
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,160
uh in 2g and 3g and 4g we saw that okay

138
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,759
we are relying on the product or we are

139
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,919
relying on the certain process

140
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,120
to have a security okay but 5g removes

141
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,759
this part and 5g is contained

142
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,000
with the city of security i mean we can

143
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,880
say that 5g

144
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,080
is a like secured by design but still

145
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,759
there are some issues still exist

146
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,520
now mandatory encryption is there for

147
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,280
intro traffic or the internet traffic

148
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,800
what i mean by the inter traffic means

149
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,520
it between

150
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,880
into inter traffic and inter traffic

151
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,199
means whether all the interfaces in the

152
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:17,759
5g

153
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,919
are interested whether it is a core

154
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,440
communication whether it is

155
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,280
some other communications like you know

156
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,280
between the operators between the

157
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,000
uh operators inside the country yes they

158
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,520
have the monetary encryption for the

159
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,160
same

160
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,560
5g improves the confidentiality and the

161
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,840
integrity of data

162
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,680
as well as the there is a home control

163
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,039
authentication

164
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,720
now some of the issues which has come to

165
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,400
the 2g 3g and 4g

166
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,280
is the visiting network decides whether

167
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,039
the authentication is completed or not

168
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,160
this is improved

169
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,600
but this is a lack issue in the 2g 3g 4g

170
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,440
but in 5g the the home network decides

171
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,880
whether the authentication is completed

172
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,759
or not

173
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,680
also 5g has a integrated roaming

174
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,840
protection called security edge proxy

175
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,880
protection

176
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,319
this protection gives you gives the

177
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,479
full roaming security if it yes of

178
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,560
course if you implement it properly yes

179
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,280
now how 5g is better than 4g first thing

180
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:11,759
is that

181
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,240
encrypted user identity over there so

182
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:14,880
whenever

183
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,800
uh whenever there is a non encrypted

184
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,319
communication that is happening when you

185
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,600
switch off the cell phone

186
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,880
so those that's why you use as a soupy

187
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,360
it should be sushi not soupy not the

188
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,960
permanent identifier it should be sushi

189
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,600
so

190
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,039
it's a concealer concealer identifier

191
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,919
okay so also there is a home controlled

192
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:34,880
authentication

193
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,360
authentication check means the ue the

194
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,360
sorry the home network can check if the

195
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,039
particular cell phone who is requesting

196
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,400
the 5g service

197
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,120
is actually roaming there so 5g does the

198
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,880
sale it does verify like that

199
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,199
there a cpa scpp security edge bucket

200
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,639
cluster protection is like an edge

201
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:51,599
firewall

202
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,479
which uh legacy technology fails to

203
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,520
provide

204
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,520
there's a network exposure function that

205
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,759
act which is integrated into the 5g

206
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,759
uh fights uh 5g network that is

207
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,919
giving the third party api into the

208
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,680
third party api to the integration of

209
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,960
the third party app

210
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,319
what do you mean by that so let's take

211
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,479
an example if you are using ss7

212
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,560
or if you're using a diameter you need

213
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,160
to integrate this

214
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,800
all your services inside the specific

215
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,840
protocol

216
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,479
so if you want to have any external

217
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,360
function for

218
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,199
some banking application whether it is

219
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,039
based on the ussd whether it is based on

220
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,800
the location whether it is based on some

221
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,680
other stuff

222
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,919
so you have to integrate the entire

223
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,000
network or the entire stack of the

224
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,599
protocol inside the

225
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,280
operator's network and it becomes

226
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,880
difficult for the operator

227
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,840
to actually control it they can

228
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,199
implement the firewall they can

229
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:43,680
implement

230
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,319
some other thing but 5g exposes the

231
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,240
certain function which is required for

232
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,400
the third party application to function

233
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,319
yes there is the nef function is there

234
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,639
in the 5g now improved aka

235
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,160
authentication key agreement for the

236
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,240
protection of the initial nas messages

237
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,080
now as i said in previously like

238
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,919
whenever you switch on the cell phone

239
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,520
in legacy technology your nc goes over

240
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,039
the air unprotected

241
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,599
so whatever your plane takes imsi it

242
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,680
goes over the air directly

243
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,440
but 5g came up with something called the

244
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,960
supr sup

245
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,840
which is a private identity but when it

246
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,319
goes

247
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,280
over the air it is encrypted by the cell

248
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:21,840
phone

249
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,639
and then sent over the sent over the air

250
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,319
with encryption

251
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,319
and when when the when this reaches to

252
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,840
the core network when it reaches the

253
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,280
core network the core network

254
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,039
will then authenticate it if after the

255
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,479
authentication is completed

256
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,479
then only the so the private identifier

257
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,399
identity is exposed to the

258
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,919
amf that is mobility function but

259
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,080
one thing here is that the home network

260
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,920
always verify whether the authentication

261
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,040
is successful or not

262
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,360
5g also claims that they are going to

263
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,800
implement the 256

264
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,360
bit encryption for 256 bit encryption

265
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,240
and integrity

266
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,680
of the user data that is actually

267
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,360
proposed that is not yet

268
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,839
finalized so what are the 5g modes of

269
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:02,640
deployment

270
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,120
there is a nsa mode that is sa mode when

271
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,880
i speak about the nsa mode it is

272
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,240
non-standalone

273
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,519
it means 5g network has to rely on some

274
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,240
other network let's say 4g network only

275
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,120
to provide the 5g services means the

276
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,959
tower of the telecom network

277
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,279
that belongs to 5g another tower of the

278
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,519
telecom network that belongs to 4g

279
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,279
first phone will be latching on to the

280
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,519
4g network then the data traffic

281
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,360
data traffic of the fire will be

282
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,399
transfer sent to sent to the 5g tower

283
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,959
and it always relies on the 4g control

284
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,240
point there are multiple multiple

285
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,680
different modes as well in the nsa but

286
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,120
we are not discussing it i have those as

287
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,000
of now

288
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,160
there's a standalone which uses the 5g

289
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,920
cells and the 5g code for the signaling

290
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,959
and the data

291
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,680
so let's look at how exactly the nsa

292
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,480
looked like

293
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,800
if you can see here let me just uh take

294
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,480
a pointer there's a pointer yeah there

295
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,200
it is

296
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,240
so this is a nr like a in 5g i forgot to

297
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,600
mention that the 5g

298
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,320
has a new name that is 5g nr new radio

299
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,320
so if you see this this red color is a

300
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,600
5g tower

301
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,760
and this is the gray color it is an old

302
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,040
lte tower

303
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,519
and the gray color epc evolved packet

304
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:10,320
core is a

305
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,839
old epc of the 4g now if you see about

306
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:14,640
this thing

307
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,680
a dotted line is just a control plane

308
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,320
okay

309
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,839
and whenever you switch on your phone

310
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,519
you go to the lte network you go to

311
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,200
register over the epc

312
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,360
and then epc will be sending that okay

313
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,440
there is a 5g network in nsa mode

314
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,200
available in your area you should send

315
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:29,839
your data

316
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,800
to the 5g network so that we can you can

317
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,160
get the file services

318
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,680
now one of the operators in india

319
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,600
recently tested this and had about i

320
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,720
want i will

321
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,480
not name this because i don't want to

322
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,480
get into any conflicts so they tested

323
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,079
the whatever the mode they tested that

324
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,680
is the nsa deployment

325
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,600
so initially all the operators are going

326
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,800
with the nsa deployment because you know

327
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,440
uh epc that is a 4g core is already

328
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,240
there

329
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,120
and they don't want to again invest into

330
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,360
it

331
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,160
easily because 5gsa comes with another

332
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,880
cost

333
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,600
but still let's look at the how uh 5gsa

334
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,360
looks like so we have completely

335
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,120
different network here that we have 5g

336
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,600
core we have epc that they can

337
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,440
communicate in the between them just for

338
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:11,839
the

339
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,920
any handover or a downgrade downgrade

340
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,519
purpose also

341
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,120
they have the complete different led

342
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,640
network complete different new

343
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,959
new radio network and all the signaling

344
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,000
that is dotted line

345
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,800
and that uh complete line the single

346
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,240
line or straight line that is the

347
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,160
data which is go through go through the

348
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,480
core network and if there is a necessary

349
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,560
or necessity of the epc and the 5gc

350
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,519
communication or

351
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:35,600
in terms of data or signaling yes that

352
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
happens between the code directly

353
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,200
no need to involve the bts okay

354
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,360
okay so let's uh go to the high level

355
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,519
components of the 5g actually i wanted

356
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:46,399
to keep this talk

357
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,640
more on the technical but uh as people

358
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,720
are not much aware of the how the 5g

359
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,480
is what is what it is so i'm limiting

360
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,800
this to very high level components

361
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,639
so we have the radio access number

362
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:58,480
network which is called the new radio

363
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,120
we have the msc that is multi-access

364
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,320
edge computing

365
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,639
we have the 5g core that is the 5g core

366
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,480
handling all the traffic

367
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,200
we have the roaming that is sa roaming

368
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,040
there is non-sa roaming

369
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,720
now when you speak about the sa roaming

370
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,279
that is s8 sar sa network to sa network

371
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,880
roaming when there is nsa roaming there

372
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,200
is nsa to nsa

373
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,959
next thing security challenges in the 5g

374
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,160
let's start with the radio access

375
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,720
network

376
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,760
so increased bandwidth increases the

377
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,000
protocol complexity yes exactly the

378
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,839
point so this allows the room for the

379
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,440
implementation vulnerability as well as

380
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,800
the configuration velocity

381
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,480
if you see the previous technologies

382
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,800
that is uh 2g 3g and 4g

383
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
you must have seen the ss7 there is no

384
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,560
way to perform i have encryption there

385
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,079
is no way to perform the authentication

386
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,079
there is no way to perform the

387
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,600
check the integrity of the data or

388
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,279
confidentiality of the data

389
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,240
but when it comes to the 4g yes they

390
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,760
have implemented all these things

391
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,279
but this actually allows the

392
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,959
implementation one if you like the one

393
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:55,440
video

394
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,360
which we discovered after fuzzing so

395
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,880
those vulnerabilities are still there

396
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,320
and it is a good chance for the

397
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,120
researchers

398
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,560
to start with the fuzzing the radio

399
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,320
network whether it is a cell phone

400
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,079
or whether it is a tower yes that is a

401
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,600
good chance there

402
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,040
there is a signaling drag now what i

403
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,120
mean by signaling drag is see

404
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,600
to communicate with any network you need

405
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,240
to perform

406
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,240
initial signaling for that so whether it

407
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,480
is a 2g 3g 4g signaling

408
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,959
it has to be there when it comes to the

409
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,399
implementation of the file

410
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,399
nobody can go like say that okay from

411
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,440
today onwards i'm

412
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,519
only going to use the 5gsa network in

413
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,040
the country but

414
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,279
if he wants to if he wants to actually

415
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,959
give this functionality in the country

416
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,120
okay khalashi can give it no issue

417
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,480
but when the the subscriber of the 5g sa

418
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,399
goes to the other country he might get

419
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,920
the nsa he might get the

420
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,920
2g he might get a 3g so 2g 3g signaling

421
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,680
drag is still there that allows the

422
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,040
older vulnerabilities to

423
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,199
exist in the network there is a roaming

424
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,040
interconnect issues

425
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,120
roaming interconnect mandate and mno to

426
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,639
support the legacy protocol for the

427
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,160
roaming the same same part that is

428
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,519
actually dragging the signaling part

429
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,320
here

430
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,720
we have the zombie ue problem what i

431
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,800
mean by zombie ua is

432
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,680
let's take an example we are in the in

433
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,560
the area

434
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,040
in the air in the area that is actually

435
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,839
about the

436
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,600
mobile malware so just imagine a case

437
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,079
like somehow your phone or your from

438
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,519
either from your browser or

439
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:21,839
from the malicious app your browser or

440
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,920
phone sorry your phone was compromised

441
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,000
and if he is sending a dos attack

442
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,800
towards other subscriber or the network

443
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,560
imagine the issue that can cause

444
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,240
so we will look and look into that what

445
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,160
exactly the zombie uae can do it's

446
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,959
just a basic use case here we have the

447
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,399
edge computing now what do you mean by

448
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,480
edge computing is let's take example

449
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,800
we have let's say example we have mumbai

450
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,399
in mumbai we have a dock

451
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,519
that is a shipyard okay so there they

452
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,440
were there there is a huge

453
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,120
whose transport of the containers and

454
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,680
everything so 5g gives one advantage

455
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,079
for these people to have their own local

456
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,000
private 5g there

457
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,360
okay now just to have a local breakout

458
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:01,839
or the

459
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,720
faster breakout so 5g implements an mec

460
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,639
that is multi-access edge computing

461
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:08,560
so this this allows you to have the

462
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,079
local network and the faster

463
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,199
communication

464
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,399
so as we see the in the 5g we have

465
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,320
one point that is the function network

466
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,839
function virtualization so they are

467
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,079
using virtualization they are using some

468
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,480
other techniques okay it could be the

469
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,680
vmware base or

470
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,839
a container based so all the issues that

471
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:26,880
is applying to the

472
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,120
open source or the container security

473
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,560
threats that applies to it

474
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,440
as well as 5g is moving more towards the

475
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,440
it rather than the teletradition telecom

476
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,320
protocol

477
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,800
because first initially 2g was most of

478
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:39,839
the asn sn1

479
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,880
3g yes that was true but 4g when it

480
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,880
comes to signaling it moved little bit

481
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,199
from radius to diameter which is from

482
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,120
from traditional telecom telephony to

483
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,040
the to the

484
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,920
normal i t but now the 5g comes with the

485
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,880
http 2 protocol with the json interface

486
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,720
so there is a good chance for the web

487
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,560
application developer to get into it to

488
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:01,839
learn about it

489
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,759
also the configuration issue still

490
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,279
applies if the

491
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,040
weak configuration is there and more

492
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,880
interfaces and more open source code is

493
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,079
going to be there

494
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,600
unless there is a some uh test cases

495
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,680
test cases validation or the fuzzing is

496
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,240
there

497
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,600
there will be some issues that will be

498
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,199
applying let's take example we have the

499
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,040
kubernetes or we have the containers or

500
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,240
we have the locals

501
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,800
so if some issue applies to that yes it

502
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:25,680
is going to apply

503
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,920
to the same same instance which is using

504
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,800
that version of the

505
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,480
docker or or anything so it too has

506
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,639
defined the threat landscape for the 5g

507
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,880
so there are multiple parts of it like

508
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,680
you know

509
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:41,040
like illegal intercept dos attack slash

510
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,920
traffic

511
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,839
which is actually a toss then the

512
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,199
privacy breach

513
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,320
fake bts slicing or resource threat that

514
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,399
is actually coming into the nfv part

515
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,160
then we have the threats originating

516
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,600
from the internet someone who is trying

517
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,240
to attack

518
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,399
inside or the to the subscriber then

519
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,320
there is a security policy conflicts

520
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,000
so there are multiple threads that we

521
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,079
are those are there that it you had

522
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:02,639
defined

523
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,679
let's look at what are the key areas

524
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:06,799
that can cause the

525
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:09,119
security weakness in the 5g so if you

526
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,199
see about the 5g we have the cloud-based

527
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,199
architecture that can cause a problem

528
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,599
network function virtualization software

529
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,599
different driven operations then we have

530
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,359
the software defined network

531
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,079
we have the data security at the edge

532
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,039
and the ran

533
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,720
and the zombie ui let's look at them one

534
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,919
by one so cloud-based architecture

535
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,640
completely based on sharing the hardware

536
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,400
resource like let's take example you

537
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,120
have one

538
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,480
where you have multiple options either

539
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,000
you have the infrastructure as a service

540
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,600
or platform as a service

541
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,760
so the owner of the platform is going to

542
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,600
share the hardware resources between the

543
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,559
different different

544
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,400
uh different different users or

545
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,600
different containers or different

546
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,880
virtual machines

547
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,520
so if there is a hardware limitation or

548
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,280
if there is a hardware problem

549
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,440
that is going to cause your msc to

550
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,919
collapse also if the host is having some

551
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:57,039
vulnerability

552
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,120
that can cause a problem yes that is

553
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,080
going to affect the

554
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,120
internal internal network elements as

555
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,600
well

556
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:06,160
privilege escalation is a major issue

557
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:06,880
but if

558
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,880
that is the if the if we can prevent the

559
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,240
privilege escalation

560
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,000
that could be either on the specific

561
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,840
container or virtual machine or

562
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,400
any virtual instance we also have the

563
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,240
session flooding issue in that

564
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,000
the risk of the open source in the 5g

565
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,679
like i said earlier right if there is

566
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:22,559
anything that is

567
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,480
affecting the linux kernel it affects

568
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,400
everything that who is using that corner

569
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,640
same way if there is some issue in any

570
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,080
version of the docker the

571
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,559
that the the epc or the core core

572
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,240
network is using yes that is going to

573
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,520
affect them as well

574
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,600
so it could be a open source software it

575
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,280
could be open source library it could be

576
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,880
open so protocol stack

577
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,799
or it could be a custom protocol stack

578
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,799
as well so recently there was some

579
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,640
research that is done by the some

580
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,480
organization they were cleaning claiming

581
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,880
that the tcp stack was having a huge

582
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,600
issue of the buffer overflow that that

583
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,080
was causing the issue in the iot devices

584
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,960
so those issues if you're if the stack

585
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,559
is the vulnerable so anyone who's using

586
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,440
the start is going to be vulnerable

587
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,440
software do an approach approach our

588
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,200
operations okay so

589
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,320
everybody right now is mostly going on

590
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,400
like automated automation so and gate of

591
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,919
trust is properly

592
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,320
needed to implement the properly the

593
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,440
automation in that

594
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,760
sufficient auditing has to be there to

595
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,880
prevent any issue

596
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,440
in the in the automation part we have

597
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,559
the orchestration

598
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,160
we have the share control between the

599
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,919
system users that is going to cause the

600
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,039
problem

601
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,200
lack of the supports and updates and the

602
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,559
sql communication

603
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,320
now let's take an example we have one

604
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,600
virtual machine

605
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,960
and there is a host of the virtual

606
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,080
machine so if we are not updating and if

607
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,919
if let me give one example of the

608
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,240
telecom ecom in telecom

609
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,240
it is not like we got an update and we

610
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,320
installed it first

611
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,600
the lab is update is implemented in lab

612
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,679
it is tested thoroughly whether it is

613
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,440
affecting anything whether it is doing

614
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,400
anything

615
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,720
by the time we actually implement the

616
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,760
you know by the time we actually

617
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,159
implement the patch or the new update

618
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,679
it is going to take at least three to

619
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,480
four months minimum i'm talking about

620
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,200
also ai ml is still difficult to

621
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,559
implement in the

622
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,400
in the telecom because it's often black

623
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,240
box and it is learned and trained on the

624
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,280
database

625
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,679
ai based this decision will take time to

626
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,440
mature because

627
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,360
in telecom there are very uncertainty

628
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,880
because let's take example if you are

629
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,520
using

630
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,000
ai on certain parts or certain things

631
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,799
okay

632
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:29,760
so let's take example we are using ai on

633
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,440
the certain uh data set of

634
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,600
data set of the business application so

635
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,640
you have certain

636
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,039
criteria defined but if you talk about a

637
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:37,840
telecom

638
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,919
subscriber could do anything anything

639
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:40,880
means anything

640
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,960
he could browse it it could do it it

641
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,559
could be any any use case so it will

642
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:45,360
take much

643
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,200
so ai or ml based design will take time

644
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,360
to mature if you are implementing ai ml

645
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,960
in the using in the software

646
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,280
operations we have the nfv that is

647
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,360
network function virtualization

648
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,520
management and orchestration of the nfa

649
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,679
security could be an issue as of now

650
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,760
then the resource isolation and securing

651
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,760
the traffic now we have seen uh

652
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,120
as the people who are experienced with

653
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,039
the docker they will be able to easily

654
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,559
tell what what is that why there is a

655
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,919
need of virtual firewall ids or ips

656
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,559
because let's take example the

657
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,240
containers or the docker

658
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,640
they implement the secure they implement

659
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,440
their own

660
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,000
internal network okay so like a software

661
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,600
defined switch they implement

662
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,000
so if we need to do some port filtering

663
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,120
if we need to do some

664
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,280
some ideas implementation or ips

665
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,320
implementation

666
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,559
we have to be part of that particular

667
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,919
software

668
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,039
like a software firewall or it has to be

669
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:37,600
there

670
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,280
we also need to block the unused

671
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,799
unnecessary port that is the standard

672
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,919
practice actually

673
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,120
when it comes to software centric

674
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,039
security secure against the common

675
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,880
software vulnerabilities has to be there

676
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,240
and there has to be a

677
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,559
thoroughly testing like fuzzing has to

678
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:51,600
be there

679
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,159
now we need to do the nfv monitoring

680
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:55,200
that is uh

681
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,720
it could be software defined network or

682
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,640
virtual monitoring we also need to do

683
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,480
the virtual sockets monitoring that is

684
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,919
between open between the different

685
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,039
virtual machines

686
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,799
as well as the health monitoring

687
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:06,320
attestation of the hardware or the

688
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,360
software component

689
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,200
why we why it is needed because let's

690
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,280
take example i'll give one example there

691
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,559
is a buzz in the

692
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:15,039
in the deep web that is there is the ss7

693
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,760
module what this ss7 malware does is

694
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,880
it patches the kernel and after patching

695
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,960
the kernel it sits between the sctp

696
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,000
protocol

697
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,039
protocol pad protocol area and

698
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,600
it just monitors everything in between

699
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,679
and if necessary it modifies it

700
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,600
so there is a need of in maintaining the

701
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,520
integrity of the software component by

702
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,200
it could be a digital signature base or

703
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,799
it could be some other means as well but

704
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,480
digital signature based that is that is

705
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,840
necessary

706
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,039
that we have the we need to do the

707
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,120
software software define network

708
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,159
security why

709
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,840
because we need to maintain this

710
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,159
complete sdn controller in an isolated

711
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,360
environment

712
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,760
okay like uh i mean yes it is not

713
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,280
completely practical but we need to

714
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,200
implement those

715
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,320
excuses we need to implement the api or

716
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,000
protocol level security we need to

717
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,919
protect the route between the if it is a

718
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,840
virtual route or is it up there

719
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,080
if it's a physical route on it could be

720
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,000
on virtual interface or in the

721
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,200
physical interfaces as well

722
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,960
data security at the age network now we

723
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,360
uh

724
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,720
as we see in that you know we've seen

725
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,720
the example i gave the example of the

726
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,320
mumbai dockyard okay

727
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,919
so first thing is that if you are

728
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:26,159
implementing any edge computing then we

729
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:27,840
need a physical security we need a

730
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,840
necessary alarms implemented at that

731
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,320
that place we need a regular security

732
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,760
audit of that place

733
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,520
also there shouldn't be any credential

734
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,600
caching on the msc side

735
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,280
now edge for a computer framework for

736
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,039
the orchestration and the business logic

737
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:42,480
has to be audited

738
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,200
whenever necessary and it has to be done

739
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,159
on the on the regular basis

740
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:50,480
we have multiple issues as of now when

741
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,600
it comes to the radio

742
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,360
it could be jamming spoofing of the

743
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,440
network interception of the traffic or

744
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,720
redirection

745
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,480
now how this could be happening now

746
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,919
let's take example if you're jamming the

747
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,240
network how do it how do you identify

748
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,520
or if you're spoofing the network how do

749
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,080
we identify in the energy in the cell

750
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,360
phone there is a option called as a

751
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,120
measurement report actually this happens

752
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,640
in background like a neighboring cell

753
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,960
measurement report or you can monitor

754
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,480
the sudden drop in the signaling from

755
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,600
specific area

756
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,600
okay then you can investigate interface

757
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,960
there could be a check of the

758
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,480
downlink and uplink jamming by

759
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,480
identifying the parameters in the in the

760
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,200
network

761
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,159
or by by this uh by the in general b or

762
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,400
e not b itself if it is nsa mode

763
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,240
then we have to physically secure the

764
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,080
site from the physical inclusion

765
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,520
also there is there has to be a

766
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,120
validation if if someone

767
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,720
someone is moving the network how we can

768
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,720
do the cells let's take an example i'm

769
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,279
running xyz networks impersonating

770
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:44,559
pqr network okay i'm impersonating them

771
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,880
and the phones nearby are trying to

772
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,000
connect to me

773
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,039
so what initially uh the the frequently

774
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,159
the

775
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,559
network network or mno could do is they

776
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,080
can ask for the neighboring site

777
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,520
measurement from the ue and they can

778
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,039
identify which belongs to them which

779
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,240
doesn't belong to them

780
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,559
also there is a technically speaking

781
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,880
there is always a room for the spoofing

782
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,400
but still this is the minimum that can

783
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,480
be done also there has to be

784
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,600
implementation of the end-to-end

785
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,440
security between the ran and gore there

786
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,240
are multiple

787
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,880
uh halls here like mid hall front hall

788
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:15,679
back hall

789
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,440
those security has to be implemented

790
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,039
here now

791
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,679
coming to excuse me coming to zombie ue

792
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:22,480
infected

793
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,520
for phone causing doors okay you must

794
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,360
have seen the movie that is mummy the in

795
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,400
that that

796
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,480
immate says okay do they do that

797
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,919
same let's look at the one case to use

798
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,559
case one smartphone with the 5g kfig

799
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:37,760
connectivity generated

800
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,880
30 mbps of doors on a website imagine

801
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,360
what this thousand smartphone could do

802
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,880
it could generate a 30 mbps 30 gbps

803
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,000
and imagine a 1000 smartphone 10 000

804
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,159
smartphone generating a 300 gbps of

805
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,640
dos on the website now we've seen in

806
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,000
india we've seen one thing that

807
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,440
the internet penetration is big and it's

808
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,480
huge

809
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,799
when the jio came as a player and what

810
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,080
we are seeing like what we are seeing

811
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,320
right now is

812
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:08,720
anybody with a smartphone is going for

813
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,840
it could be a video doing the tick tock

814
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,240
or

815
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,720
tick-tock alternative youtube everybody

816
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,840
is behind it

817
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,400
for that purpose the main reason of the

818
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:18,880
youth

819
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,400
joining the tick tock and the joining

820
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,039
the videos is is a monetary gain so

821
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,919
there could be some uh as as this uh

822
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,039
monitor gains

823
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,520
expectation goes higher so what we can

824
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,400
expect

825
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,240
from them is we can expect them from is

826
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,640
there uh we can give the chance to the

827
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,919
this this opens a chance to though

828
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:37,440
actually this roster or who wants to

829
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,240
commit sunday

830
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,960
such a crime okay so that gives them uh

831
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,320
an opportunity to

832
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,760
you know send the phishing may have

833
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,080
means or send a spoofed application

834
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,360
or some uh like a application that can

835
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,000
promise promise the user that some money

836
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,279
so that can cause

837
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,000
uh opening there so we need to also

838
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,679
implement the ai base artificial

839
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,279
intelligence based traffic shaping

840
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,039
because you know it is a huge data

841
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,919
imagine even if we are even if in india

842
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,440
we are able to give one cell phone a

843
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,880
gbps speed

844
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,520
that is a huge speed for us for someone

845
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,480
to handle that

846
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,159
so we need to do ai based traffic

847
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:14,720
shaping for the for this uh for the gsm

848
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,520
for the

849
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,679
network that is going to be there so

850
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,000
requirement of testing in 5g

851
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,440
so i've defined there are multiple

852
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,919
interfaces we have 5gr interface

853
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,559
which could have the 5g handset wireless

854
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,240
5g test nodes could be there

855
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,840
so we need to do the air interface

856
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,840
assessment we have the mec

857
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,159
mobile edge computing platform sorry

858
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,840
multi-access edge computing platform we

859
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,600
need to do the testing of the msc and

860
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,799
the backhaul

861
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:40,399
then we have the core network we need to

862
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:42,559
do the complete coordinate of testing

863
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,640
now as we've seen that in the curve in

864
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,600
the 5g

865
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,159
we have the protocol called http 2 and

866
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:49,279
the json-based

867
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,600
apis so that opens up the web

868
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,640
application

869
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,520
developers or web application security

870
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,279
testers a good

871
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:00,720
area to go go and explore into it

872
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,880
one of my friends said that i know what

873
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,559
is the what is up with the

874
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,399
people who designed the 5g that they

875
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:07,919
want to bring in more i.t

876
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,600
companies rather than the telecom

877
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,600
companies so he was saying that there is

878
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,039
something happening in the background

879
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,320
okay let's leave that

880
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,000
i'm like let's secure it let's focus on

881
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,080
securing it now there is one more

882
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,600
remaining uh interface that is the

883
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,880
roaming testing you need to do the

884
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,720
continuous roaming testing to test your

885
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,320
5g or the

886
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:27,760
legacy technologies readiness for that

887
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,919
next we have what we can do in the air

888
00:28:29,919 --> 00:28:31,279
interface testing there could be

889
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,799
configuration testing there could be

890
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,720
non-access station protocol testing

891
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,120
we can do a ddos simulation we can also

892
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,520
check the nfv or the container burst

893
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,279
when the actually nfv and container

894
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,440
burst is the orchestration failure

895
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,440
when assigning a task to the new

896
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,200
container or popping up and popping

897
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,279
pushing down the popping up and pushing

898
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,200
down the new container that

899
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,919
as required we need to do the g node b

900
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:54,399
testing

901
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,480
it could be configuration assessment

902
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,240
physical attacks on the hardware because

903
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,840
the 5g claiming to be the

904
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,840
huge uh number of gene would be is going

905
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,279
to be implemented

906
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,600
we need to do the rru and the open ram

907
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,360
testing as well like remote radio head

908
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,000
and

909
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,320
open run testing has to be there we need

910
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,520
to do the mec

911
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,600
backhaul threat testing when it comes to

912
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,679
mac platform audit it could be

913
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,919
platform as a service infrastructure as

914
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:18,720
a service

915
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,960
slicing validation traffic segregation

916
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,080
has to be there

917
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,000
when it comes to front hall mid hall and

918
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,520
black hole testing we need to do the

919
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,880
network architecture audit

920
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,600
configuration review traffic analysis

921
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,360
and the attack whenever you speak about

922
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,120
the traffic analysis we should include

923
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,200
operational environments user data and

924
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:36,880
the signaling as well

925
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,520
now there is one more nice part for the

926
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,799
web application developers or

927
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,080
verification testers

928
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,960
that the mec application exposes the

929
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,080
wave api

930
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,960
to the third party also uh when it comes

931
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:51,600
to nfv is nfp sorry msc and nfv

932
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,600
bus testing yes we need to do the data

933
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,440
simulation to test the what what can

934
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:58,480
what can go wrong in the first nfv part

935
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,559
we have to do the 5g core testing that

936
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,159
is analysis of the deployment

937
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,120
architecture

938
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,640
how do we also we need to do the

939
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,960
different slicing validation

940
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,720
we need to do the signaling protocol

941
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,399
assessment okay where

942
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,960
whether it is http 2 or json based

943
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,120
whether it is a pfcpf at a protocol or

944
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,559
whether it's a dos attack

945
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,320
we need to simulate as an internal

946
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,320
attacker it could be on a vm

947
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,559
virtual machine or a docker we need to

948
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,640
try for the privilege escalation we need

949
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,679
to try for the

950
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,000
uh some disrupt specific vulnerabilities

951
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,960
of course disrupt specific

952
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,399
vulnerabilities could be

953
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,600
uh disrespectful vulnerabilities like

954
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,880
you know those could be

955
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,559
like uh just like

956
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,480
mr specific vulnerabilities uh could be

957
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,360
like you know

958
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,000
uh there has to be found out of out of

959
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:46,799
the fuzzing

960
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,960
uh then we need to also do the ddos

961
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,480
stimulation from the core network

962
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,240
impersonation or the data interception

963
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,240
has to be there like pfcp is

964
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,240
vulnerable for the session modification

965
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,600
attacks

966
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,440
next thing is that uh roaming and

967
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,440
internet testing we need to do the ss7

968
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,559
testing

969
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,880
just to be actually ss7 doesn't actually

970
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,399
realize for the part of the

971
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,000
s7 and diameter actually doesn't rely

972
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,640
for the uh essay or an sa mode but the

973
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,519
thing is that

974
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,519
to be compatible with the legacy

975
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,200
technologies when our when the

976
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,840
subscriber

977
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,600
of the 5g network goes outside of the

978
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,360
country and rome in another country

979
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,960
so for that purpose we need to do the

980
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,559
ss7 and diameter testing

981
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,799
gdp testing has to be done as well as as

982
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,240
well as and we need to do the internet

983
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,880
testing as well

984
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,720
coming back to the technical details of

985
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,640
the testing yeah air interface

986
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,559
multiple things are there configuration

987
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,559
vulnerability physical silent projection

988
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,159
nasty record and you get a nas protocol

989
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:40,240
one repeats ddos simulation

990
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,480
or the s cast validation has to be

991
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,960
tested as we have the short time i need

992
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,440
to

993
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,519
quickly go through them not sure we have

994
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,200
to do the msc and the backfill thread

995
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:49,840
testing

996
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,600
uh analysis of the different models of

997
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,159
the mec it could be fast i pass

998
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,120
is okay now then slicing validation like

999
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,720
i explained this uh

1000
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,320
everything uh to you guys in the

1001
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,760
previous slide but i'm still explaining

1002
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,120
them

1003
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,200
one is a network architecture audit

1004
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,679
configuration review

1005
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,919
traffic analysis has to be done based on

1006
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,039
the ai based

1007
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,720
as well as the diesel simulation has to

1008
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,559
be there we need to test the web

1009
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:16,559
application as well as the wave api in

1010
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,279
that

1011
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:20,159
when it comes to nsa core and is testing

1012
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:21,120
then we have to do

1013
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,519
test the epc and the ram in addition of

1014
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,919
the with addition of the gene node v

1015
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,159
we need to see how what signaling drag

1016
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:29,840
is affecting my network whether it is

1017
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,919
going falling back to 2g 3g whether

1018
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:34,000
because as of now enough there is a

1019
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,240
voiceover nr is there but still

1020
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,039
the in the nsa mode the operator are

1021
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,120
still going for the voiceover lte based

1022
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,320
nr so okay and if there is no voltage

1023
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:47,279
there then from 4g to 2g3 you have to

1024
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:48,240
come back

1025
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,679
actually one of the operators already

1026
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,159
switched off the 3g network from india

1027
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,080
pass from japan india so they are using

1028
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,399
2g if there is a no voltaic capability

1029
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,480
available in the phone so from there the

1030
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,679
user comes from the 4g

1031
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,159
to 2g network and then performs a call

1032
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,399
there if there is no volte capability

1033
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,240
then we need to identify the different

1034
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,159
path for the route looking or core

1035
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:10,000
network exposure in the in the user

1036
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,399
plane we need to see what are if the

1037
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,399
slicing validation is properly properly

1038
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:15,760
done or not

1039
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,840
coming to the sa code we need to check

1040
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:18,880
most of the thing like

1041
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,320
initially first we need to check what

1042
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,559
are the risk of open source time

1043
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,080
we need to check the lack of core

1044
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,000
signing we need to check what are the

1045
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,760
different threads for the 5g

1046
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,600
that is affecting the http under json

1047
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,799
api that could be

1048
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,200
hidden manipulation session hijacking

1049
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,880
malform traffic generation

1050
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,039
protection mechanism bypass it could be

1051
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:38,000
proof uh

1052
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,240
like a pfcb protocol testing i will be

1053
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,080
explaining what is

1054
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,799
in the last in the last slide so we need

1055
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,399
to do the roaming testing as i said

1056
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:49,679
earlier like seven diameter gtp

1057
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,679
and the 5g cbp testing has to be there

1058
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:52,720
yes the

1059
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,360
5g claims that we have the sap but yet

1060
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,799
there are still some vulnerabilities

1061
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,399
that could be affecting him we need to

1062
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,880
test that as well

1063
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,880
so gsma has come up with a nice

1064
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,880
initiative for the telecom industry that

1065
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,279
is called

1066
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,039
the nissas that is network equipment

1067
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,480
security assurance scheme

1068
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,159
it is defined on the compliance check

1069
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,918
based on the cgpp document

1070
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:14,719
it is called the s okay this oscar's

1071
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,359
document

1072
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,440
they define what testing has to be done

1073
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:19,119
for the certain network element

1074
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,679
if it has to be deployed in the network

1075
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,040
so there are multiple vendors for

1076
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,719
parties who are already participating in

1077
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:25,918
this that is nokia

1078
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,879
ericsson z huawei actually i'm expecting

1079
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:29,520
the india

1080
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,159
is uh is the most of the most of the

1081
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,000
part of the india that is uh

1082
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,679
sorry most of the telecom stacks that

1083
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,359
are going to be that are being developed

1084
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:38,960
in india like if you speak about the go

1085
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,480
to the internet and search for the

1086
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,960
stack development most of the countries

1087
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,639
companies in india that are developing

1088
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,040
the

1089
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,879
protocol stack so they has to purchase

1090
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,480
they have to they need to participate in

1091
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,520
the in this testing

1092
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,199
so that they can check their complete

1093
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,719
network they can check their computer

1094
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,599
strength of the

1095
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:54,960
network that you can check the center of

1096
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:57,440
their devices because what i've seen

1097
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,119
that is most of the indian vendors they

1098
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,560
are just developing the stack and they

1099
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,320
are selling it to the european companies

1100
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,520
or any other companies who are

1101
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,280
interested in buying stack

1102
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,040
saying that we can give you the stack

1103
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,880
but we cannot sign the sla but

1104
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,640
if you implement the nissas and some

1105
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,720
more trusting yes

1106
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,320
indian stack vendors or the protocol

1107
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,720
vendors can say that yes we can sign

1108
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,240
this right because we've seen that the

1109
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,720
government the stack vendors or the

1110
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,079
network equipment vendor they say that

1111
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,760
no we cannot sign their sony that was

1112
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,160
the case

1113
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,640
with the one of the operator not sure so

1114
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,000
thank you guys thank you for

1115
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,160
uh your attention if you want to contact

1116
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,720
me you can contact me at

1117
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,880
as.metricshield.com

1118
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,720
also we are going to start one free

1119
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,560
webinar series on certain topics of the

1120
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,560
telecom you can

1121
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:41,599
check this link and submit your interest

1122
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,640
for this

1123
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,640
so as of now if you have any questions

1124
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,920
just let me know

1125
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,839
i will be happy to answer them please

1126
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:52,400
thank you okimp i'm sure the telecom

1127
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,920
industry needs

1128
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,640
more assistance and audits uh when it

1129
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,240
comes to 5g networks

1130
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,000
we have few questions okay i'm going to

1131
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,520
read them out for you yes please

1132
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,599
uh at what layer does 5g implement

1133
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,720
encryption to protect voice data

1134
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,720
so as of now nobody is implementing the

1135
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,839
voiceover nr

1136
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,599
but it is still there in the

1137
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:15,440
specification so whenever you are

1138
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,800
talking about the encryption there are

1139
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,240
multiple encryption that is happening

1140
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:18,880
that is

1141
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,119
first one is uh over the non-access

1142
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,640
terminal detail that is a signalling

1143
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,079
protocol there is a

1144
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:26,480
access stat and protocol so if you if

1145
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,920
you're talking about the access

1146
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,920
non-access data it is encrypted

1147
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,680
end-to-end means if it is going from

1148
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,359
your cell phone it is going till the

1149
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:33,760
core

1150
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,240
and then it is decrypted but if it is if

1151
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:37,359
you want to do

1152
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,160
a data that is your traffic user traffic

1153
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,079
that is encrypted from your cell phone

1154
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,760
and that is goes to the goes to their

1155
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,400
till your tower

1156
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,680
all right uh there's another question

1157
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,040
uh aren't there any interface management

1158
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,280
mechanism like

1159
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,880
zc sequence or something as of now i'm

1160
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,240
not aware of it because

1161
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,160
even we are studying the 5g we started

1162
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,480
our internal research like

1163
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,480
three to four months ago and we have we

1164
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,520
are able to find out some

1165
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,440
vulnerabilities in the pfcp as well as

1166
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,359
in the air interface but that is still

1167
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,160
our study is still going on as of now

1168
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,040
all right

1169
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,160
uh i'll take the last question uh

1170
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,520
before we open for break uh required

1171
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,000
hardware

1172
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,040
list for testing 5g network like sdr

1173
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,960
frequency range support

1174
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,400
actually if you see a usrpb210 sdr

1175
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,880
uh can be used in the nsa mode but

1176
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,440
you'll need two usrpb210

1177
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,560
with a stable clock i will say that they

1178
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,119
have the

1179
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,440
special clock like a tiny device but it

1180
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,480
costs 700

1181
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,720
for that you'll need two devices of that

1182
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,680
and you will need a

1183
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,720
extreme edition of the i9 processor to

1184
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:49,680
set up your own

1185
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,640
5g network whether it is nsa or sa but

1186
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,560
approximately i'll say that that budget

1187
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,400
is going to be around six thousand to

1188
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,280
seven thousand dollars

1189
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,119
the rest is that if you if you want to

1190
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,880
test the open source version of it you

1191
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,079
have free phy gc

1192
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,560
and ran simulator where whether you can

1193
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,320
actually where you can actually

1194
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,960
simulate the actual 5g traffic in sa or

1195
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,839
nsa mode

1196
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,839
yes that that people can implement it on

1197
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,440
open source but if you want to actually

1198
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,560
run your cell phone

1199
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,119
on the 5g network in ssa or an sa mode

1200
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:21,280
yes you need at least 7000 to 8000

1201
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,800
6000 8000 budget for that

1202
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,040
all right thank you for this amazing

1203
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,920
presentation

1204
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:33,200
uh we look forward

1205
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:36,240
uh on your upcoming webinars and

1206
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,040
learning more about telecom security

1207
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,240
thank you anthony thanks for everything

1208
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,839
