50
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,240
real abstract challenge

00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,360
uh what are the challenges we face to

52
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,159
evaluate

53
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,640
mergers and acquisitions especially in

54
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,960
the area of technology startups

55
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,960
what would be a smart way to support

56
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,280
this tech tutorials

57
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,280
and investing in startups is always a

58
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,400
bit risky

59
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,879
but the success is even more significant

60
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,400
if we have placed

61
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,879
our bets in the right idea it's

62
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,599
essential

63
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,520
to reveal the hidden risks right at the

64
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,599
beginning and for this

65
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,200
i will now give it to my fellow

66
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,680

successful startup what has been your

70
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,840

74
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,959
the thing startup um i have multiple

75
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:45,599
places

76
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,160
uh where i'm confronted or working in

77
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,519
startups

78
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,040
audios even founded its own

79
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,879
startup in india in 2019

80
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:00,000
even have when we have a very solid

81
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,560
foundation here in europe and in germany

82
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,680
for india it was really like the

83
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,680
foundation of a new startup

84
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,200
with a new market and we came to india

85
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,560
with our goal to establish our

86
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,280
not only brand but also also our service

87
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,400
in india so we

88
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,360
really faced the same issue that normal

89
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,440
startup has

90
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:27,200
and especially with 2020 uh situation

91
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,040
uh it was not an easy start but

92
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,440
we had one month after foundation we had

93
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,040
our first clients and then

94
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,720
uh we just had to start had to stop

95
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,760
business in march and and then we had

96
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,879
some months where we

97
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,920
tried to reinvent ourselves and just try

98
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,920
to find out

99
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,519
what should we do in this kind of

100
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,959
situation and i think

101
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,400
what makes a startup successful is yeah

102
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,640
being focused on what you wanted to do

103
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,720
but also be prepared that

104
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,959
maybe nothing will go like you have

105
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,959
planned in the beginning

106
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,040
then the other place where i'm coming

107
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,239
from with the

108
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,360
startup ecosystem

109
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,480
is that over the years we

110
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,879
with our clients our clients asked us

111
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,959
about

112
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,560
operational due diligence for their

113
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,520
acquisitions so more and more especially

114
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,440
industry

115
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,639
companies which are leading

116
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,560
in what they are doing like automotive

117
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,240
companies and so on

118
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:36,240
um don't put too much

119
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,360
energy in research anymore they try to

120
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,040
um yeah acquire startups

121
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,520
uh with good ideas with good business

122
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,400
models

123
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,080
um to scale up their um

124
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,919
yeah their research faster and to

125
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,919
integrate new technologies faster

126
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,040
and um so from what we have seen there

127
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,120
by supporting the classical

128
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,000
uh advisory and uh financial due

129
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,880
diligence

130
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,320
we saw a lot of mistakes that startups

131
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,600
can do especially in infonomics

132
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,759
yeah and from this experience i think i

133
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,680
can contribute to this panel also with

134
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,960
some

135
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,960
examples that i have seen in the past

136
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,400
we'll get there george thank you

137
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,400
set up your perspective what makes a

138
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,320
successful startup uh

139
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,919
and what's your perspective on this

140
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,360
infonomics

141
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,960
sure sure thanks thanks a lot uh we're

142
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,120
just so very very glad to be here

143
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,360
uh burgess probably represents a good

144
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,720
company who might end up

145
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,240
acquiring us and george represents

146
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,240
someone who might help him in doing that

147
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,160
so very very self-serving of me to be on

148
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,600
this group

149
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,759
uh but yeah i think great point was just

150
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,720
uh bringing that up

151
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,800
what makes a successful startup right uh

152
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,919
so being

153
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,759
part of one for the last three years has

154
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,520
been a roller coaster of a journey

155
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,520
especially coming from uh you know a

156
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,800
very corporate kind of

157
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,280
background i would say two three things

158
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,400
right i was thinking about this

159
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,280
uh in fact the last few days on a

160
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,160
different context

161
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,319
first of all i would say would be like a

162
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,600
state of mind

163
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,680
right a state of mind which which varies

164
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,199
somewhere in between

165
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:13,360
uh optimism paranoia

166
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,360
in equal parts and just bull headed

167
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,960
persistence right just

168
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,039
staying at it so that's what i would say

169
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,199
from a from a state of mind perspective

170
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,600
the second is uh in terms of the tech or

171
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,720
whatever you're trying to do whatever

172
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,000
problem you're trying to solve having

173
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,440
the right people staying ahead of the

174
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,560
curve

175
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,600
uh being technologically superior

176
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,039
being good at disrupting the market

177
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,720
whatever angle you're trying to do but

178
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,080
staying ahead because complete

179
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,520
competition does catch up it's a very

180
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,120
very volatile world right

181
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,880
and you don't have it's not like a

182
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,240
startup is doing something in millions

183
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,800
of dollars

184
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,520
already in capital some costs which has

185
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,440
a moat there is no such mode right

186
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,319
others can come in and and most

187
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,520
importantly and this is probably the

188
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,240
most important

189
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,360
one don't run out of money right

190
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,240
so um uh have the funds to pay salaries

191
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,919
that's my job as a ceo

192
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,840
uh at least for the next six months

193
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,599
which might mean that you're constantly

194
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,560
fundraising

195
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,319
which is absolutely fine you need to do

196
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,240
that so i would say those are the two or

197
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:08,880
three things

198
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,680
um which i would say very important for

199
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,520
a startup to succeed survive and make it

200
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,360
through

201
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,880
thank you so much saurabh i like the

202
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,479
part don't not have money

203
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,560
it's a state of mind from optimism to

204
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,160
paranoia but with bull headed

205
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,520
persistence

206
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,319
uh we often defined by our failures can

207
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,240
each of you give me one example where

208
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,000
you nearly thought you failed

209
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,840
or you failed and you bounced back

210
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,840
because in this forum you have so many

211
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,479
people

212
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:35,919
so many ambitious people who want to

213
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,840
start their own startups and they may

214
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,160
face that occasional hopefully not

215
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,800
uh opportunity of failure and how should

216
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,720
they leverage that from your strength

217
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,319
from your experience to bounce back

218
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,080
yep should i start yeah yeah

219
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,919
i think uh 2019-2020 uh situation that

220
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,680
we had with audios india is

221
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,120
just kind kind of that so we came

222
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:04,319
um with with our business idea

223
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,080
bringing our infrastructure maturity

224
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,479
um assessments to india which are kind

225
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,199
of unique

226
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,879
and which require to be on site

227
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,080
so we which requires people to be at the

228
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,919
client's place

229
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,240
and with 2020 this was no longer

230
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,520
possible so

231
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,400
we needed to reinvent everything and we

232
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,660
even discussed

233
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,039
[Music]

234
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,440
does it make sense to have this company

235
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,679
after all this pain

236
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,479
creating it in india it was not easy not

237
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,559
being from india itself and

238
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:42,080
and but definitely we discussed um

239
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,320
and what should we do and uh with the

240
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,120
help of

241
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,800
uh indian friends we developed uh

242
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,920
technology to uh yeah

243
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,920
to to to be able to do our job without

244
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,399
being

245
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,320
physical onsite so it created an

246
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,760
opportunity

247
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,399
out of um yeah something where we

248
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,440
thought uh

249
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,360
is necessary which we found out it's not

250
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,680
necessary if you put more efforts in it

251
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,880
and if you

252
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,920
try to do something maybe different and

253
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,720
unique

254
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,399
from what you have thought you should do

255
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,959
before so that's i think

256
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,000
what makes us at the moment

257
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,880
seeing a scaling up with what we are

258
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,800
doing at the moment

259
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,360
and even in the past i have similar

260
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,320
experiences

261
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,320
maybe also being too early for the

262
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,000
market so

263
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,959
that's that's something i would say in

264
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,279
the early 2000s

265
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,399
when i wanted to start with uh open

266
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:40,959
source

267
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,600
uh software development where i worked a

268
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,600
lot in communities not

269
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
making money out of it just doing it for

270
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,839
fun and then trying it to bring it into

271
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,720
my

272
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,360
company at this time to to build

273
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,320
something out of it and

274
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,640
if you are too early if you are not able

275
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,200
to make your point what does it bring

276
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,680
to your customer you will not make it

277
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,480
through as a startup and maybe you

278
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:10,240
need to wait uh until the market is

279
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,640
ready for you and and i think that's

280
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,880
also for all the startups the

281
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,640
the major issue that sometimes they

282
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,920
don't see the benefit

283
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,480
right away you see it clearly but

284
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,519
sometimes you are not even able to

285
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,680
transport this message and then maybe

286
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,279
you need someone who helps you to do

287
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:30,000
that and

288
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,120
i think companies like yours purchase

289
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,399
are really good at that yeah thank you

290
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:36,959
so much

291
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,279
sort of opportunity for failure what

292
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,720
does one learn in your real life

293
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,480
experience for the audience

294
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,720
awesome thanks a lot about this so uh

295
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,560
yeah march uh if you think about it

296
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,000
right uh our company

297
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,279
uh i would say uh cloudsec till about

298
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,200
march of last year the last six months

299
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:53,760
we have

300
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,399
totally been focused on ramping up our

301
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:56,959
our

302
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,680
outside india operations right middle

303
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,399
east

304
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:03,200
southeast asia etc and then suddenly

305
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,399
march it

306
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,959
and we could not travel and oh my god it

307
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,720
was a tough time right we were staring

308
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,760
down and it was like

309
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,279
we got into the mode of batten down the

310
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,360
hatches prepare for a long slog

311
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,279
uh go into like the hibernation mode

312
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,120
figure out what to do

313
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,440
uh and also from a fundraising

314
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,120
perspective we were at a very critical

315
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,880
juncture at that time i mean i can't

316
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,480
reveal a lot of those details but yeah

317
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:24,959
that

318
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,720
it was it was like the worst case

319
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,079
scenario for us

320
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,880
and we thought what to do i think that's

321
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,000
where

322
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,440
in tough times right you have to figure

323
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,880
out what your strengths are our stands

324
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:35,680
for agility

325
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,000
we could we could as they said turn on a

326
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,440
dime right we could

327
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,880
we immediately repurposed all our

328
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,120
available assets back to india

329
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,680
right we totally changed our strategy uh

330
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,440
we we started realizing there was a huge

331
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,200
opportunity for example at that time

332
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,040
and because of the whole work from home

333
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,760
movement right a lot of

334
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,600
our security perspective we focused on

335
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,600
that and we were able to

336
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,519
keep the the clock ticking and the

337
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,519
things moving during the lockdown right

338
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,040
thanks to that and now obviously things

339
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,480
are starting to improve and we are kind

340
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,040
of

341
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,839
coming out of our winter hibernation

342
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:09,440
holes and which is great

343
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,639
but i think yeah that's it it's all

344
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,120
about figuring out uh and being agile

345
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,360
being open and not letting

346
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,320
adverse circumstances shut you down most

347
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,959
importantly

348
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,040
i like that coming out of the window

349
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,560
hypernation hibernation

350
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,320
keep the clock ticking in tough times

351
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,680
figure out your strengths

352
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,920
prepare for the long slog and go into

353
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,519
hibernation well said

354
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,440
what type of help is available during

355
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,440
these times was it or you're only on

356
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,360
in-grid determination and dogmatism

357
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,560
which helped you there

358
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,600
or were you able to get help from

359
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,519
either external government organizations

360
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:45,279
or industry friends

361
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,399
or mentors is that an internal slog

362
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,600
process

363
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,839
as you reflect back or did you reach out

364
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,360
to somebody who gave a helping hand and

365
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:53,760
said

366
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,360
wow that helping hand really helped

367
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,079
yeah um so from my perspective network

368
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,590
is everything so

369
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:03,519
[Music]

370
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,839
of course here in europe we have help

371
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,200
from the government

372
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,560
but for our indian venture we had not

373
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,600
um so yeah

374
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,440
so you really have to rely on on the

375
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,360
network that you already have and they

376
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,760
helped us a lot and especially open

377
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,600
source communities can be very helpful

378
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,160
by

379
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,560
developing the technology that you have

380
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,720
but they can also

381
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,959
yeah this can be also be tricky because

382
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,040
if you fully

383
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,920
put on to open source software that can

384
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,839
also create some dependencies if you are

385
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,839
not a contributor to that

386
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:41,199
so that you might have some

387
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,920
dependencies to libraries which are even

388
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,320
have

389
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,399
a non-permissive library or something

390
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,000
like that that maybe

391
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,639
uh puts you in a position where you

392
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,320
cannot use your business model anymore

393
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,000
and then here it's really really helpful

394
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,920
to have this kind of a network that

395
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,440
supports you even

396
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,800
in the crisis if you have to do

397
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,880
something and you have to develop

398
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,880
something that that you have not planned

399
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,000
in the beginning

400
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,680
um to get to to be fast and i think

401
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,680
that's constantly reaching out working

402
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,480
with

403
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,880
multiple ecosystems at the same time

404
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,800
having maybe also

405
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,800
or investing in relationships to the

406
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,399
government

407
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,639
is definitely helpful but without the

408
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,920
network uh

409
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,560
to be honest uh that's that's not

410
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,839
possible especially

411
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,959
with my experiences that i has as a

412
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:34,880
german in india it's it's extra special

413
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,800
difficult

414
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,000
so my my hub definitely came from also

415
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,600
from the nile community and

416
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,959
from the friends who are there also from

417
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,600
the daily community and of course also

418
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,120
and rich and friends

419
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,680
uh so that's helped us a lot uh during

420
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,199
this uh this time you know

421
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,720
what's this commenting and this keeps on

422
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,839
helping everybody i wonder what what's

423
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,240
the

424
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,880
just like swarup said that you might buy

425
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,639
his company out i'm assuming next year

426
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,360
you'll sponsor me

427
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,480
there that's the thing great thanks

428
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,000
who helped you um

429
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,360
in um in india

430
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,560
um yeah especially uh the intel guest

431
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,240
in mumbai which is our lawyer

432
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:27,040
so he connected us to potential clients

433
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,160
also high-ranking clients

434
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,279
who gave us um

435
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:36,959
insight in how large indian

436
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,279
corporations work and how they could

437
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,320
or better how could we work together

438
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:44,959
with them

439
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,399
to get our product in their

440
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,600
organizations and finding out

441
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,920
if it's possible even in this kind of

442
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,600
crisis so

443
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,720
this would be one example also

444
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,680
i i got a good feedback from sandeep

445
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,920
singh i hope he is here in the session

446
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,199
because i asked him about

447
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,120
finding the right people for a startup

448
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,639
is also something really important

449
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:11,199
because

450
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:13,920
if you have something uh uh if you have

451
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,560
someone

452
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,480
uh who is able to do the job and he

453
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,240
leaves the startup uh

454
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,240
then that's definitely super dangerous

455
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,680
for the seller because your whole

456
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,000
startup

457
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,720
can fail if this person is the only one

458
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,560
and he leaves the company and so

459
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,440
uh sandeep and vaibhav also they gave me

460
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,320
some

461
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,040
hints what i should do in india and what

462
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,480
not

463
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,320
thank you so much over to you who helped

464
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
you yeah

465
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:41,680
thanks so i think uh uh in full fairness

466
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,720
right uh

467
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,240
uh there are a couple of customers who

468
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,800
we did approach and who did help us by

469
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,839
either you know kind of helping us out

470
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:51,759
with either the payments or the business

471
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,600
or the contracts etc

472
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,959
um but frankly also

473
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,600
who could have helped us right not many

474
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,440
companies that our customers themselves

475
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,560
were also in the

476
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,559
same soup we were in right they were

477
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,240
facing the same lockdown situation

478
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,160
business was tanking

479
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,280
uh yeah they were facing the same

480
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,039
challenges in fact a very interesting

481
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:11,919
thing happened

482
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,919
uh we had spare capacity we did not

483
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,760
leave we wanted to let people go so then

484
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,799
we started thinking

485
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,919
what do we do right and then we try to

486
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:21,520
think how can we help these people

487
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,160
in the hope that okay when the grass

488
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,760
turns green again they might

489
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,319
you know remember that and so some of

490
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,520
the program the couple of programs you

491
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,799
started during that time it actually

492
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,240
you know created created a lot of

493
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,160
goodwill which we are now

494
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,240
you know all set to reap the benefits of

495
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,919
in terms of helping people

496
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:40,000
do some analysis do some vulnerability

497
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,320
scans etc stuff like that right

498
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,520
but they didn't have the money to pay

499
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,600
for at that time but they needed it they

500
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,200
needed it more than ever

501
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,200
uh in fact another thing we did and that

502
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,360
was more on the b2b part right helping

503
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,320
our customers

504
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,760
we also thought about what we could do

505
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,520
with community we had so many friends so

506
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,880
many community members who

507
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,919
had lost jobs so in fact we we allocated

508
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,120
some point we started out

509
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,960
a kind of a program where anyone who has

510
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,360
lost a job can apply for a uh for a

511
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,880
internship with us it's like a

512
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,559
three-month work and you get paid for it

513
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,640
right as a way to kind of help them

514
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,440
uh go get through like financial crunch

515
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,880
situation

516
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,360
and i think that that helped us a lot

517
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,880
right um

518
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,960
frankly it's i don't hold any grudges

519
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,080
about anyone else or any other

520
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,679
government or anyone in helping us

521
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,280
because yeah the the

522
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,440
avenues themselves were limited like i

523
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,280
don't know what could have been done

524
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,320
maybe i am unaware of that trend thanks

525
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:32,799
for

526
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:34,240
and touching you know although you are

527
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,640
struggling you and chart you put out a

528
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,280
thing of if anybody else lost a job you

529
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,640
could give them internship when the

530
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,160
grass turns green again

531
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,919
spare capacity didn't want to let people

532
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,679
go who could have helped you is more

533
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:46,880
important lovely

534
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,960
sometimes we say better the question

535
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,480
better the answer but the world works

536
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,840
it's all about the right question you

537
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,559
ask and how a key person can make on our

538
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:55,679
company

539
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,760
okay so great you were in tough times

540
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,720
you come out

541
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,080
happily hopefully you'll have a great

542
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,000
success run from here

543
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,320
uh what about attracting the right

544
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,200
talent

545
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,520
uh how would you go about in that

546
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,039
startup stage when there are

547
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,400
other companies who pay top dollar and i

548
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:12,720
know

549
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,799
i you know sometimes we lose people you

550
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,559
know in big fours

551
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,160
uh and we are surprised that you want to

552
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,440
join a startup when i'm gonna give you

553
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,400
so much experience

554
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,559
and they say yes i i want that just

555
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,640
shuffle startup the rush is great

556
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,480
what what's your magic how do you

557
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,280
attract key talent

558
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,000
yeah that's especially very very tough

559
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,880
for me

560
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,640
yeah sullivan can start i think he wants

561
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,640
to say yeah sorry yeah

562
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,720
go ahead yeah i don't know so we have

563
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,919
gone from uh

564
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,679
from eight to eighty in about two years

565
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,080
yeah so uh and we obviously can't afford

566
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,960
to pay

567
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,799
anywhere close to what what the big

568
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,640
folks pay uh in the way

569
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,120
so yeah we leverage our strengths um i

570
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,480
personally experienced it right coming

571
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,720
from a large company i can do

572
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,000
in about i can do in a day what i do in

573
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,440
a startup i can do it in a day it would

574
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,640
take me a month to do it in a large

575
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,200
company

576
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,320
right it's that fast that agile uh the

577
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,559
whole whole culture the ability to

578
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,240
so i mean we have a very simple thing

579
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,840
for example if you look at teams right

580
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,960
uh

581
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,720
probably five of the people who are

582
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,960
heading the largest teams in my company

583
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,640
uh started their first shop with us

584
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,240
about two to five years ago

585
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,559
in that range so imagine someone with

586
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,760
three to four years of experience

587
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,000
running a team of seven to ten people

588
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,679
having a huge responsibility it will

589
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,120
take them 20 years to get there in a

590
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,320
large company

591
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,280
right also and this is something which i

592
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,799
heard back from the employees right

593
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,720
they came and came to me with an idea or

594
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,640
me or any of the other managers and we

595
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,080
said okay go ahead do it

596
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,360
and they were like shocked are you

597
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,440
kidding me they said like in my earlier

598
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,200
company it would go to a committee take

599
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,960
six months for the decision to be made i

600
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,720
said yeah go to it here's your budget

601
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,240
i want to see this result in like a

602
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,760
month and they were like shocked beyond

603
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,480
belief

604
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,320
yeah that's our strength we play to it

605
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,880
that's probably the the best way

606
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,159
and then obviously give them a learning

607
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,679
environment make sure they are they're

608
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:00,799
challenging enough as

609
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,039
easy as as it is to hire with that

610
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:03,919
promise

611
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,679
it's equally easy to lose if you're not

612
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,120
delivering on that promise because the

613
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,640
layer of money the layer of

614
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,840
position stable job is always there yeah

615
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,120
excellent insights yeah uh you know

616
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,320
giving them the promise

617
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,440
uh shock beyond belief and agility is

618
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,919
what you can

619
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,360
we could other guys could do your job

620
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,799
perspective what's your magic for

621
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:29,440
attracting

622
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:32,640
talent yeah

623
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,880
i i think it's indeed freedom um

624
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,720
of course freedom in in

625
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,760
in borders that you did you

626
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,440
have common values or a common goal but

627
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,960
um we just hired a talent uh who just

628
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,880
came from a company and uh she worked so

629
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,320
she had to start with us and we just

630
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,960
told her we cannot pay you what you have

631
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,840
had in this

632
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,360
large large uh funded company

633
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,600
and so she was

634
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,720
ready to to really let a lot of money go

635
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,000
just for working

636
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,480
uh with us to have the opportunity to

637
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,559
have the freedom to develop

638
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,679
her own project or her own

639
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:25,440
product uh with i would say

640
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,880
the freedom of entrepreneurship within a

641
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,000
startup

642
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,159
is something which can be very

643
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,520
attractive for

644
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,360
experienced people but also i think

645
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,400
having a place for people who are

646
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,679
fresh from the university um giving them

647
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,000
good mentorship is something which is

648
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,120
more valuable for them often than money

649
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,919
because that's what i have seen during

650
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,039
my time

651
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,960
in open source project like fedora

652
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,880
project as example

653
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,559
where i had the ability to to learn so i

654
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,640
came from military background i haven't

655
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,480
had no idea how the industry work i

656
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,559
didn't have no idea how open source

657
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:08,799
ecosystems really worked and i made it

658
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,640
to the fedora board

659
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,840
just as not not commercially it was

660
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,919
really just

661
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,480
a hobby for me in the beginning and i

662
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,200
learned so much from that and i was even

663
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,520
ready to work there without getting paid

664
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,240
so

665
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,520
i i think the freedom and and

666
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,039
if you find the right people that have

667
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:31,520
to drive to to develop themselves then

668
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,840
they are good for you and your startup

669
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,159
definitely

670
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,159
how long is an average ten year of a

671
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,600
person in startup does he stay from

672
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,320
higher to

673
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,200
or does he like three four years or

674
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,400
what's the average

675
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,240
time span a person stays in a startup

676
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,400
someone a new employee i like what you

677
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,279
mentioned

678
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,919
uh attracting for uh you know freedom of

679
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,440
entrepreneurship is a great attraction

680
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,799
for experienced people

681
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,400
while for new people it's a good

682
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,080
mentorship so how long does the person

683
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,760
stay in a startup

684
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,320
oh that that's definitely different i i

685
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,279
here i

686
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,240
not want to talk only about our company

687
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,400
so what i have seen over the years

688
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,720
with the companies we worked with is

689
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,200
that we had one company in singapore

690
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,080
where the core team was there since 12

691
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:16,720
years

692
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,440
so is the question is is after 12 years

693
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,360
is this still a startup

694
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,640
um and then we had another company

695
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,520
in berlin where they had a really high

696
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,720
fluctuation

697
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,279
and to be honest the maturity of the

698
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:32,159
product they had

699
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,919
some kind of the same product which was

700
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,279
in building automation

701
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,559
and measuring power consumption and

702
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,640
also taking the numbers out of the power

703
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,159
consumption and put it in some

704
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,240
infonomics magic

705
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,279
and the maturity of the product in

706
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,640
singapore

707
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,240
was higher but of course the dependency

708
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,840
the technology was uh a problem because

709
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,919
the technology under the hood was also

710
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,960
quite old and and the dependencies even

711
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,440
were so old that you could not deliver

712
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,120
the devices to the clients

713
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,000
or other way around they already had

714
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,760
devices in the field

715
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,120
so maybe having this kind of

716
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,840
long startup phase is not beneficial for

717
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,120
the product uh

718
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,760
in form of dependencies but in this case

719
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,039
it was for maturity

720
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,760
in the functional requirements and the

721
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,200
berlin

722
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,480
company was super fast they were

723
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,919
super interesting but they had

724
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:36,640
of course not the basis of a solid

725
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,080
product so

726
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,840
everything was proof of concept

727
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,760
everything was oh don't press this

728
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,400
button

729
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,480
because then we don't know really what

730
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,679
happens so

731
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:48,000
um and the fluctuation here was quite

732
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,640
high i would say two years

733
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,880
was the fluctuation and um for our

734
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,080
company of course

735
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,400
we tried to have a sustainable

736
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,120
relationship

737
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,840
um and try to give an environment so

738
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,120
they can grow

739
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:04,000
within the company but that's the thing

740
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,760
because we are some kind of a hybrid

741
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,200
because we have a mother

742
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,320
company who is yeah

743
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,840
have a good funding or is on solid base

744
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,960
and uh we can finance our startup

745
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,840
uh approaches from this com companies

746
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,320
sort of

747
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,559
is there a part of our culture would

748
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,320
people in india be staying longer or

749
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,919
shorter compared to people in west or

750
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,000
other places for startups

751
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
uh i i don't know i know i don't think

752
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,080
so i i just maybe i maybe i have not

753
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,279
done enough analysis but

754
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,400
i mean let me talk to you about my

755
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,000
experience right i would broadly put

756
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,480
people

757
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,120
in three or four buckets uh see one

758
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,799
thing to realize about startups is that

759
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:41,520
there is no

760
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,679
pyramid here it's not like the top 10

761
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,760
bottom 20 and mid 70

762
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,320
right to be successful in startup you

763
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,039
need those

764
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:50,880
the top cream of the talent right

765
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,080
otherwise you can't

766
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,960
run it effectively which means that uh

767
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,320
so for example there's one bucket of

768
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,000
people who usually leave within two to

769
00:26:58,000 --> 00:26:58,640
three months

770
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,760
those are the the wrong hires right or

771
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,360
the performance related issues or

772
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,120
whatever it is there's another set of

773
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,880
people who might leave within 10 to 12

774
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,960
months those are the people who

775
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,279
uh who where the sheen of a startup life

776
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,080
wears off

777
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,840
right the late nights get too much they

778
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,760
want the stability you want the whatever

779
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,120
the business class travel and they go

780
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,760
back

781
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:20,720
right then you have the third set which

782
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,159
is like to leave after two three years

783
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,120
and

784
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,279
go start a business of their own right

785
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,559
those are those are good people i like

786
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:27,360
that right

787
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,720
that's good but at least for us uh

788
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,120
the major part is the rest maybe the 70

789
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,960
80 percent who are left over who just

790
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,840
don't leave

791
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,279
who are invested into the comment

792
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,679
company right that is the only way you

793
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:40,720
will make it work

794
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,960
right there's no other way you can make

795
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,480
it work you have to have that core team

796
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,080
who's totally committed

797
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,799
who are all aligned to the true north

798
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:49,200
and

799
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,880
they are they are working with you

800
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,720
through thick and thin and they will be

801
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,919
thick and thin

802
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:56,559
in a startup

803
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,760
i have to have the core team i'm taking

804
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,600
down notes i'm gonna give in the end

805
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,200
have to have the core team aligned to

806
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,440
the true north i like that word

807
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,960
things so ah and

808
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,720
basically we're in alcon and flex always

809
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,159
gets the best talent you know it's the

810
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,440
best hiring ground

811
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,440
and he's smiling now i have to please

812
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,799
him right he told me to say some good

813
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:17,600
words

814
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,240
uh how important is for people to have a

815
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,399
tech idea of a good startup

816
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,200
or a good process idea is take a largely

817
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,240
the component

818
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,000
or could you have a process way of doing

819
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,880
a startup something better smarter

820
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,960
and would you find people just migrating

821
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,320
to a great tech idea

822
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,520
is tech uh have so much of a high

823
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,039
attracting factor or could there be

824
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,840
other areas of a smarter simpler process

825
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,320
which a business may buy uh

826
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,159
or just a take take take take attracts

827
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,679
you know what is that magic is take

828
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:48,880
completely

829
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,720
uh taking over the startups or process

830
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,240
ideas of startups could also make a

831
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,559
difference

832
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,159
yeah yeah okay um i i think

833
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,159
um tech of course um is something that

834
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,559
uh is super attractive but also

835
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:08,559
dangerous uh when the investors don't

836
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:09,840
understand invest

837
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,960
in what they're investing to so

838
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,720
from my perspective technology

839
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,320
is around 80

840
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,799
of the investment reasons that we see

841
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,520
with our clients

842
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,399
and not process so um from from the

843
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:28,960
scope

844
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,120
uh of of the investments that we see

845
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,279
it's more about the technology

846
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,559
um i can imagine that smart process

847
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,399
ideas or the combination of smart

848
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:38,880
process

849
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,240
ideas um

850
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,840
can can attract but to be honest uh

851
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,600
i don't see it very much and

852
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,600
i think the danger with investing in

853
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,799
technology without

854
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,000
knowing in what you really invest is uh

855
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,480
so of course they all will tell you that

856
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,200
their

857
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,720
tech is superior to the competitor

858
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,120
they will say hey we don't even have a

859
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,440
competitor because we are

860
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,480
first different unique uh so um

861
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,880
that's that's uh something where i think

862
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,640
here the due diligence process

863
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,159
also needs to get enhanced and uh the

864
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:22,080
the to to yeah make and analyzes under

865
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,039
the hood of the

866
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:26,240
technology is something um yeah i would

867
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,440
say is a challenge for

868
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,039
for for the next uh period uh to

869
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,039
to to find out ways finding metrics

870
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,320
finding the right skills

871
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,039
uh how to analyze if a technology really

872
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,799
is worth investing to

873
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:40,720
because otherwise the the owner of the

874
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,320
company always will

875
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,640
give you the the better the best picture

876
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,480
of this product of course right

877
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,559
yeah so i think one one one time you can

878
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,159
probably pat yourself on the back i

879
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,799
don't think uh i i don't know how much

880
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,960
process optimization opportunities are

881
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,960
left i think you guys have done a great

882
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,320
job of

883
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,080
sorting that problem all the big for the

884
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,080
strategy consulting companies and all

885
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,760
uh but yeah obviously that's one of the

886
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,120
reasons tech is

887
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:14,080
very overwhelmingly dominant in all new

888
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,440
startups you look at the fundraise

889
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,799
pattern it's the same

890
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,720
all the big money is going to tech

891
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,559
startups does not does not mean that

892
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:21,279
there's not

893
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,440
nothing left to innovate in that on the

894
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,039
on the process side

895
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,799
i'm sure there is but yeah i i i see a

896
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:30,840
lot of dominance for the tech side thank

897
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,840
you

898
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,480
is tech uh just the technology is it the

899
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,760
algorithm is it

900
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,919
uh the what system you're using is it

901
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:42,960
your data

902
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,360
is it the way you're analyzing that data

903
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,480
right

904
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,240
in fact we did this introspection a few

905
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,000
months ago and realized that for us

906
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,320
ip and tech it's not just algorithms or

907
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,240
something it's so much more

908
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,399
and very very revelatory for us actually

909
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,880
thanks and you give a good point sora

910
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,159
where does a company like

911
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,679
you know startup aligned with a big four

912
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,519
or a stat consulting firm

913
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,559
and how do you find that

914
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,320
so uh you wanted to go first but just

915
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,360
sure you're keen to go first go ahead i

916
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,559
can keep the energy

917
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,600
see see uh look at this way right um

918
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,000
we can we we are startups are the group

919
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,679
which can we can which can

920
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,960
buy fast fail fast innovate fast right

921
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,480
and uh obviously

922
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,960
so that's that's that's what our dna is

923
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,120
right if you look at a before a before

924
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,679
is where

925
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:40,080
uh it's it's more thought through it's

926
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,960
more deliberate

927
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,679
it's much more strong you know

928
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,279
industrial strength

929
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,039
right those are two very complimentary

930
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,960
skill sets the idea is

931
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:52,000
how do we create a funnel wherein some

932
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,840
of the best ideas from the startups are

933
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:54,799
finding their ways

934
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,919
into the ecosystem of a big four right

935
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,200
and uh i mean i i don't think it's it's

936
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,120
a it's a case of a white space there are

937
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:04,399
enough and more systems which are

938
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,320
happening there right uh

939
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,080
they are all of all the big fours

940
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,679
obviously we collaborate on the industry

941
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,679
level i've worked with you so many times

942
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:14,799
right uh and then even from a

943
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,880
venture investment perspective also

944
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,640
there are there are a lot of overlays

945
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:22,159
so i think that part is covered um

946
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,840
obviously you have to give a longer

947
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,600
leash to startups because

948
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,279
yeah a lot a lot of the startup work is

949
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,279
a little bit of the wild west

950
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,919
and then very culturally uh deviated

951
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,840
from how big fours operate

952
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,080
so i think that's probably the only uh

953
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,679
only uh

954
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:41,039
thing to keep in mind

955
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:45,279
sure uh any questions from the audience

956
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:47,519
uh would you want to ask a very tough

957
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,360
question besides joining them

958
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,360
uh and they're always always going to

959
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,559
say yes for the best challenge to

960
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:53,200
malcolm

961
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,320
but any audience questions to me

962
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,440
or to yeah i have a question uh the

963
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,960
audience can also send them send in

964
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,559
questions on the zoom chat

965
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:05,600
uh define a startup at what stage are

966
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,440
you at a startup because there are

967
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,199
fancy companies who have billions of

968
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,960
dollars of money in their bank account

969
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,879
and they still call them startups

970
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:15,599
so is the word startup just a sexy name

971
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,119
given to a company

972
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,239
or it's actually when a company you say

973
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,040
less than

974
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,679
20 people or 10 20 employees or less

975
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,159
than

976
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,280
a certain threshold of turnover so how

977
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,239
do you define a

978
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,719
startup

979
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,839
any one of you

980
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,079
why don't you go ahead i i should yeah

981
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:40,879
so

982
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,359
i know there are if i i think if you

983
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,040
google it you will get some explanation

984
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,960
for it but for me a startup is

985
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,399
uh more something like um

986
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,199
how you yeah it's something that you

987
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:53,839
have

988
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,800
in yourself so if you are driven by a

989
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,160
product or by an

990
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,599
idea that you want to bring to the

991
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,680
market and where you

992
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,200
have passion for and and one when want

993
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,720
to develop it want to build a

994
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,520
team around it one to uh make benefit

995
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,680
out of it for for your clients

996
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,480
um you can do that in a large corporate

997
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,520
but you can

998
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,320
of course do it maybe not this fast in a

999
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,680
corporate if they don't have to

1000
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,280
structure for it

1001
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,640
and you always will have these

1002
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,359
boundaries that maybe will

1003
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,200
put up barriers for you where you have

1004
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,640
to report some success sometime and

1005
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:34,160
so i think startup for me is something

1006
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,800
you have the freedom to develop

1007
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,920
something

1008
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,040
that uh makes the world better

1009
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,119
that helps your client uh that's

1010
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,079
something that you

1011
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,040
can drive and i think this can be kind

1012
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:47,839
of a mission

1013
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:51,040
because i don't would put it in

1014
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,320
a time frame because i'm in open source

1015
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,599
a project since i would say 20 years and

1016
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,839
i maintained the fedora security lab

1017
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:01,839
together with fabian affalter since

1018
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:05,119
i would say 10 years of course

1019
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,599
we make it for fun and not for money but

1020
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:08,880
we definitely bring

1021
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,680
a benefit for the community and we have

1022
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:12,000
people

1023
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,440
who are using it and um i think if you

1024
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,880
want to scale it up and you

1025
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,480
want to find an investor for that that's

1026
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,000
also possible so

1027
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,040
i also call this a startup idea but

1028
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,839
i i would not put it in some kind of

1029
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,520
okay that's the definition you have to

1030
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,240
be

1031
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,280
two years uh in the market and uh after

1032
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,880
four years you have to be

1033
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,359
uh you you have to have break even and

1034
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:40,079
after six years you have to be

1035
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:42,160
able to sell it to someone i don't think

1036
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,640
that's the definition of a startup so

1037
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,079
startup if you have to define startup in

1038
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,440
one word what would that be

1039
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:51,599
nimble align agile

1040
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:55,599
sorry mentality and for usual george

1041
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,520
i will that's the word that i was maybe

1042
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,599
looking for and not found

1043
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:03,040
he stole it no no but uh so

1044
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,680
i'm not a native speaker so sometimes uh

1045
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,800
what's the word in german

1046
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,480
what's a german word for that give me a

1047
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,359
german vote for them

1048
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,240
mentality

1049
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,240
mentality i like that any more more

1050
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,119
questions i'm just

1051
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,480
i would like to summarize three pages of

1052
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,160
notes lovely catches have gone

1053
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,680
but uh there are two questions in the

1054
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:28,160
chat uh i'll just take them and then you

1055
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,240
can summarize purchase

1056
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:33,200
how cyber security getting embedded in

1057
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,280
startup ecosystem different from a large

1058
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,839
corporate

1059
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,160
i think purchase you have the largest

1060
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,359
corporation among the panelists

1061
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:46,160
thank you so much

1062
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,560
let's keep the margin aside yeah the

1063
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,400
technical discussion

1064
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,480
so the question is how is cyber security

1065
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,240
and i think each one of us even in a

1066
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,680
large corporate

1067
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,839
i have to run my business as an

1068
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,280
entrepreneurship right

1069
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,760
uh we may have a lot of funding but i am

1070
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,359
facing the same challenges

1071
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,200
hiring the best talent with saurabh or

1072
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,800
george may take from us

1073
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,960
uh pay a bit less extra but the agility

1074
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,800
and the freedom you give your guys

1075
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,040
i may or may not be always give to i may

1076
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,560
give a varied experience

1077
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,800
i may give a person an opportunity to

1078
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,800
work in manufacturing healthcare retail

1079
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,359
banking

1080
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:22,240
telecom uh and a breadth of sometimes

1081
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:23,920
can work in cti and then you can migrate

1082
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,280
to vapt and then

1083
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,800
red teaming and threat hunting and

1084
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,440
compliance so we have the ability to

1085
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:31,680
fluctuate that and give a a rounded

1086
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,480
experience

1087
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,800
where you have a pointed advantage if

1088
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,079
someone's in depth

1089
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,839
you can go to the nth depth and he can

1090
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:39,200
become a master of that

1091
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,119
so there's no plus or minus much it just

1092
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,960
depends on the person's individuality

1093
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,640
or what he or she is looking at that

1094
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,880
point in time but the startup culture is

1095
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,040
something what i run and what you run

1096
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,640
similarly because we also have to ensure

1097
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,320
that we run our own business

1098
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,079
uh we compete with the very best of

1099
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:56,079
startups as well actually traditional si

1100
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:56,560
firms

1101
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,359
who also in cyber uh it's a growing area

1102
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:00,000
but the best

1103
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,359
part it's a pie which is ever expanding

1104
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:06,240
a space for all of us to work together

1105
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,160
there's no need for the pie is not

1106
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,079
shrinking you know we luckily touch wood

1107
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,320
when the industry which is growing and

1108
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,599
for the next 10 years there's

1109
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:16,079
enough amount of growth for everybody

1110
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,760
the key question is how do we synergize

1111
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,119
how do we harmonize

1112
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:21,119
and that's what's up now how can big

1113
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,280
four people work with you guys how can

1114
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:23,599
you

1115
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,760
encourage you we have may some question

1116
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:27,119
you may not have but you have good

1117
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,560
talent which we may not have

1118
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,560
you've got good ip which we may take

1119
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,760
years to develop

1120
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,520
and i see a big synergy in that i'm

1121
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:36,800
thinks a good answer hopefully

1122
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,760
absolutely but we would want to know

1123
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,740
your margins also in the future sometime

1124
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,079
[Laughter]

1125
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,920
for another day for another nalcon maybe

1126

all right i'm gonna summarize uh some of

1128
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,960
the lovely words which we had

1129
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,240
uh solid foundation nothing will go as

1130
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,119
planned in

1131
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,119
the beginning don't put too much energy

1132
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:58,240
in research

1133
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,200
a good company may acquire last three

1134
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,079
years

1135
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:03,760
uh roller coaster ride of journey it's a

1136
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,280
state of mind

1137
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:08,800
uh don't run out of

1138
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,240

begin too early for the market create an

1140

out of the current situation not making

1142
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:19,040
money out of it

1143
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:21,440
doing it out of fun need to wait until

1144
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,720
the market is ready for it

1145
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:25,359
unable to transport out of it prepare

1146
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:26,400
for the long stroke

1147
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,119
go into hibernation in tough times

1148
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,800
figure out your big strengths

1149
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,800
keep the clock ticking and then come out

1150
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,000
of winter hibernation

1151
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,040
12 years is it still a starter trying to

1152
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,720
have sustainable relationships three

1153
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,359
buckets

1154
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,079

attractive but also dangerous so

1159

investors who don't understand it they

1160

will tell you our tech is superior than

1161
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,280
somebody else will even tell you we

1162
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,960
don't have competition

1163

00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:13,599
of startup

1173
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:15,680
startup is not something you put uh it's

1174
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,280
an in you invest inside

1175

open source communities were helpful not

1181
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,680
