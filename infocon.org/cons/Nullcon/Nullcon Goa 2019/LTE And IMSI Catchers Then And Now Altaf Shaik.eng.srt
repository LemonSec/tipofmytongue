1
00:00:03,109 --> 00:00:08,280
hi everybody sorry that Ravishankar is

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:10,590
not not here because like he had a minor

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,899
accident and then he's not able to join

4
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,000
the conference but I'll be replacing his

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,009
talk with something different although

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,080
I'm not that familiar with you SST and

7
00:00:17,009 --> 00:00:20,670
it's too old for me for me something

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:23,669
that's interesting is like in C caches

9
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:26,130
and stingrays so I'll be talking about

10
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:27,930
that like all the work we have done in

11
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,538
the last six years and then what has

12
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,519
come up something new and LTE but also

13
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,080
maybe something that's interesting in 5g

14
00:00:32,519 --> 00:00:36,210
or what are the attacks that can happen

15
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:40,920
in 5g and what are the mitigations are

16
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:43,860
all this stuff so I'm actually studying

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,309
I'm doing my PhD in tu Berlin and Ravi

18
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,600
Shankar is in Norway so we work together

19
00:00:46,309 --> 00:00:50,129
most of it most of the time we are doing

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:53,790
like cellular security research but

21
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:57,839
since we are on to the like moving or

22
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:59,820
moving quickly to the 5g and LTE so we

23
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:03,089
are mostly focusing our work on LTE and

24
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,970
also we do a lot of protocol analysis

25
00:01:03,089 --> 00:01:09,650
which is something really essential on

26
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:12,000
the research point of view then doing

27
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:14,100
implementation bugs or something like

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,720
this this is also interesting but there

29
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,360
are some limitations like regarding

30
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,010
finding implementation bugs which which

31
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:23,910
is something different when it comes to

32
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:25,500
IP world we also do like secure network

33
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:27,600
building like helping different

34
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,290
organizations trying to build secure LTE

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:34,259
networks also what kind of mitigations

36
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:37,140
they could use for building a strong 5g

37
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,850
network because a new network doesn't

38
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,290
mean that or a new technology doesn't

39
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,360
mean that it's solving all your previous

40
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:44,159
problems and then maybe there's a nice

41
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:46,830
technique to hide the previous problems

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:48,810
and then just market it like wow this is

43
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:52,710
the new technology and then we are in a

44
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:55,940
safe world so this talk I just give a

45
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:58,798
recap of what telco attacks look like

46
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:01,080
what kind of attacks usually usually

47
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,720
your phones or the base stations or the

48
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,330
cellular networks can experience

49
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:09,060
sorry then I talked about like two main

50
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:11,850
important aspects of cellular networks

51
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,440
the first is like privacy and the second

52
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:15,530
is availability so which is nothing but

53
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,200
availability of a service

54
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:21,320
of LTE users or in terms of LTE networks

55
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:25,600
so and then some setup or all the stuff

56
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:28,880
we used to perform so many attacks and

57
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,710
then so what's the basic problem like

58
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:33,049
people some people keep asking you like

59
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:35,810
okay we know that MC caches exist in 2g

60
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,490
and we are now going to fight G and this

61
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:39,950
problem hasn't been solved yet so what's

62
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:42,080
the reason like why like why is this

63
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:43,489
still prevailing and then the the there

64
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,170
are so many strong minds in the world

65
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:46,640
and that that are not able to solve this

66
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,619
kind of problem so what are the reasons

67
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,600
for that and the kind of impact or

68
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:52,670
status that we have brought into 3gpp so

69
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,440
that many of the privacy and

70
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,480
availability issues could be fixed and

71
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,420
then I give a little bit inside into

72
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,310
fight G and see leave it where like you

73
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:03,470
can what kind of research directions

74
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:06,440
that could be open or for more research

75
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:08,090
sure if you are interested before going

76
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:10,190
into the thing like some basic knowledge

77
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:12,020
about mobile networks like it's it's

78
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,030
quite simple you have the phone you have

79
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:16,489
the base station which are talking over

80
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:18,260
there the base station is connected to a

81
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:19,760
core network which is nothing but the

82
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,890
kind of a central server which is

83
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,560
managing authentication and encryption

84
00:03:21,890 --> 00:03:25,880
of all your subscriptions like so

85
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,320
whenever you insert a SIM card it's

86
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,850
talking to the base station and the base

87
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:31,970
station reports back to the core network

88
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:35,150
it would send all your details of your

89
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:37,280
SIM card and the the core network like

90
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:39,470
this performs the authentication of of

91
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:46,280
your SIM card if it's a legitimate one

92
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:48,970
or if it's a fake one based on that then

93
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,320
then comes the point of security where

94
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:53,090
over there encryption is setup between

95
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,299
the phone and the base station there

96
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:58,160
could be also a security level between

97
00:03:55,299 --> 00:03:59,959
the core network and the UE u v is

98
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:02,690
nothing but a phone so sometimes like I

99
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,610
I get used to this terminology like kind

100
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,340
of technical terminology which is

101
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:08,690
defined in the specification so u V is

102
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:10,459
nothing but the phone in note B is

103
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:17,988
nothing but the technical term for base

104
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:20,090
station so I interchangeably use them so

105
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:24,260
moving to telco attacks like this is a

106
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:25,940
simple flow diagram of all the all your

107
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:27,200
mobile communication so whatever data is

108
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,540
you are sending from here it goes to

109
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:31,390
base station to the corner

110
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:34,120
welcome to the Internet so the first

111
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:35,940
attack the most popular one is MC

112
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:38,260
catches MC catches also called as

113
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,570
stingrays so these are some of the

114
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:44,349
popular like powerful devices that are

115
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:46,960
being used by governments or state state

116
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:50,260
agencies or even a lot of hackers and

117
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:55,239
lot of criminals to actually track users

118
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:57,969
or to intercept communications to create

119
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,920
denial of service attacks or you could

120
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:02,350
do a lot then you have when you own one

121
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:05,950
such device so the thing is like with

122
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:07,930
this the attacker has to be in the local

123
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:11,409
region like here these are not remote

124
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:13,210
attacks so the the the the power of this

125
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:15,280
attack would be like the range that the

126
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,710
base station is actually covering up so

127
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,539
all the phones that are falling under

128
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,849
the range of this base station or this

129
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,710
MC catcher are really affected and it

130
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:26,110
depends on like what kind of attacks

131
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:27,760
this MC caches are playing so basically

132
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:30,640
like in the beginning like that the term

133
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,650
MC catches was like okay NC is nothing

134
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,620
but it's the permanent identity of your

135
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:38,560
SIM card so every unique or every single

136
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,180
card in this room has a unique number

137
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,610
called NC its international

138
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:45,400
international mobile subscriber identity

139
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:47,080
so if I can if I own this identity it

140
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:51,700
means that I can really identify you

141
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:53,650
wherever your SIM card is going later

142
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:55,539
like when they when they try to increase

143
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:57,159
the power of these devices like they try

144
00:05:55,540 --> 00:06:00,210
to add interception capabilities where

145
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:02,800
they can secretly listen boys

146
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:04,900
do lot of denial of service attacks

147
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,730
either beat on the phone or on the

148
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,140
network I'll show you some some denial

149
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:10,710
of service attacks and some privacy

150
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:13,120
related attacks like in the next slides

151
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:14,500
then the second type of attacks like man

152
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,030
in the middle so there is somebody

153
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:19,630
sitting in between the phone and the

154
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:21,520
base station and trying to decode at

155
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:23,310
least some kind of channels let's say

156
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,930
for example broadcast channels are

157
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:29,680
usually unencrypted so it's it's quite

158
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:31,780
easy to do to get access to such

159
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,990
information for example like if somebody

160
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:37,989
is having a kind of passive device that

161
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:39,850
can actually read the broadcast channels

162
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:42,160
or the frequencies of a mobile network

163
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:43,690
operator can actually

164
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,790
some meaningful information about the

165
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:47,979
operator and try to use it to actually

166
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:50,340
establish an MC capture device which we

167
00:06:47,979 --> 00:06:50,340
saw before

168
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:57,220
third one is interception like a passive

169
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,570
attacker so these these attacks are

170
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,710
difficult to detect because like there

171
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:06,370
is no noise being made by this attacker

172
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:08,198
on LTE like doing a passive interception

173
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:10,479
attack of voice is something not really

174
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:13,690
possible yet but maybe somebody can can

175
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:16,750
try on GSM it was quite successful

176
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:19,539
because GSM didn't have any proper of

177
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:21,280
security so people were actually able to

178
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:24,219
passively listening to voice calls and

179
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,900
try to play them back so GSM was kind of

180
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:31,630
something completely broken down in

181
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:34,780
terms of security the popular one ss7

182
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:38,349
most of them are crazy about but the

183
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:40,750
thing is like you need to get an sa-7

184
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:43,560
access or find the endpoint that's

185
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:47,199
actually answering all your ss7 queries

186
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:52,210
these attacks actually originate from

187
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:54,400
the internet they do not sit at the air

188
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:56,080
interface so they dig their remote

189
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,659
attacks and can be performed from any

190
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,849
part of the world so somebody having an

191
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:03,370
access to a Jamaican operator and has a

192
00:08:00,849 --> 00:08:06,430
shady connection to so many parts of the

193
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:08,590
world can actually request the operator

194
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:10,000
to send your location location in terms

195
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:12,520
like Wichita where you are connected to

196
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,990
and exactly like some kind of what are

197
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,539
the GPS coordinates of a particular

198
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:18,340
phone which is far away or like in a

199
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:21,099
different continent so these attacks are

200
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:27,000
really powerful not only this location

201
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:29,530
tracking attacks also all the SMS or

202
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,300
calls can be divert to a different phone

203
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:33,338
number so these are really powerful

204
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:37,839
attacks and hard to do unless you have

205
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:40,150
necessary access some denial of service

206
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,610
attacks like where you have like since

207
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:44,650
flag attacks simply very have like so

208
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:46,330
many malicious phone that are trying to

209
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:48,760
attack a base station and then so that

210
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:51,310
you keep the network busy and not trying

211
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:54,819
to answer the legitimate requests from

212
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:55,719
so many phones so these are some typical

213
00:08:54,820 --> 00:09:00,100
attacks that actually

214
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:02,500
happen in mobile networks so last five

215
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:04,420
six years we try to play with lot of PVC

216
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:06,519
caches lot of sting their devices and we

217
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:08,079
try to build some of them and see what

218
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:09,850
kind of attacks are really possible on

219
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:12,459
LT because like when LT was introduced

220
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:14,139
in 2009 there were a lot of requirements

221
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:17,500
like okay this should be proper security

222
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:19,360
compared to 2g or 3G and there should be

223
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:22,089
the the privacy levels or expectations

224
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,759
were really high but we wanted to test

225
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:26,740
it out like does this really possible on

226
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:29,379
LT because like it's we know that it's

227
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:32,680
possible to operate the base station and

228
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:34,600
then we wanted to test it out so we we

229
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,878
first targeted like what is privacy and

230
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,529
always the phone is it's kind of a

231
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:41,110
favorite target because like everybody

232
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:43,360
who owns one and this could be something

233
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:46,779
that's easily attackable and see what

234
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,509
happens on that but now with 5g even the

235
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:51,910
cars or small IOT devices are really or

236
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:54,250
or your home devices can actually be

237
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:56,860
controlled by mobile network so now not

238
00:09:54,250 --> 00:10:00,610
only phones even small low-power devices

239
00:09:56,860 --> 00:10:02,379
like narrowband IOT are are actually one

240
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:07,509
that will to to so many attacks that

241
00:10:02,379 --> 00:10:09,819
that happened on 4G and 5g so when I

242
00:10:07,509 --> 00:10:13,120
talk about five C so we are actually

243
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:15,189
talking about three different things the

244
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,800
first one is trying to compromise

245
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:20,349
somebody's identity the second is like

246
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:23,680
trying to get the location the third is

247
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:26,379
like how do you hijacked DNS on or like

248
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,959
hijack or do a man-in-the-middle DNS

249
00:10:26,379 --> 00:10:31,420
attack on somebody that's using an LTE

250
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:34,750
data traffic we know that these these

251
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:37,599
attacks are possible on 2g but we wanted

252
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:41,649
to try them out on on 4G and see like

253
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:44,050
are they really possible but since this

254
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:49,569
is a repro talk so all this work they'd

255
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:52,389
dates back to 2015 2014 so okay the

256
00:10:49,569 --> 00:10:57,189
first bug we found one was on so many LT

257
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:59,800
phones like by standard like the phone

258
00:10:57,189 --> 00:11:02,800
should not reveal its IMEI i mia is

259
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,229
something unique to your phone so once

260
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,389
somebody that's leaking leaking IMEI on

261
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,720
the air interface it's possible to

262
00:11:07,389 --> 00:11:10,370
identify a particular

263
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:15,530
person at a particular time in a

264
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:17,780
particular location so we we gathered so

265
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:22,520
many LT phones that time I think it was

266
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:25,400
around s 6 or s 7 or Galaxy s5 or even

267
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:27,140
iPhone 5 iPhone 6 we started playing

268
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:31,240
this devices so we try to send a special

269
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:34,850
message that's called I'm sorry a

270
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:36,290
special message called tau reject which

271
00:11:34,850 --> 00:11:39,200
is nothing but a tracking ad update

272
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:42,650
project that actually deletes certain

273
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,150
kind of security context in the phone so

274
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:47,300
by doing this the phone is like

275
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:50,030
completely refreshed now so it's in the

276
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,859
state like you inserted brand new SIM

277
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:53,930
card which doesn't have any kind of

278
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:55,670
security context in the phone which

279
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:57,589
which can actually protect the phone

280
00:11:55,670 --> 00:12:00,229
from sending the IMEI

281
00:11:57,590 --> 00:12:02,330
to rogue devices so for a network it's

282
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,550
fine - actually I made a religious

283
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:06,950
magnet in network it's completely fine

284
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:08,599
to know your IMEI because it's it's

285
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:10,220
required for example in in the states

286
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,980
like where you don't have a SIM card

287
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:16,280
they do the authentication based on your

288
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:20,120
IMEI but but here like in Europe and

289
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:21,199
Asia we usually use SIM cards so we have

290
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:24,350
other identity called

291
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:28,190
MC which which we actually use to do the

292
00:12:24,350 --> 00:12:31,130
authentication so you found a bug and it

293
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:32,690
was affecting most of the vendors like

294
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:35,240
ok hardly if you count there could be

295
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:37,520
maybe five or six different baseband

296
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:39,650
vendors who are actually manufacturing

297
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:44,270
this mobile chipsets for example like

298
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:46,569
welcome Intel who of a or media tech so

299
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:49,040
there are a few manufacturers and then

300
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:52,070
we try to report this back to them so

301
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,410
that they could fix it I think it took

302
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:59,510
maybe five or six years to actually fix

303
00:12:54,410 --> 00:13:01,310
this kind of bug so at least ok I'll

304
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:03,830
tell about like the the bug fixes and

305
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:05,329
everything may be up sometime so this is

306
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:09,160
the first one like which which actually

307
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:13,610
affects the privacy of LT subscribers

308
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:15,589
moving on like I showed like there are

309
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:17,990
different identities that are used by

310
00:13:15,589 --> 00:13:20,060
the phone we know that in C is something

311
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:22,430
related to sim IMEI is related to phone

312
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:25,430
and there is other entity called him see

313
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:26,660
okay we can also call it like GOP I it's

314
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:29,030
nothing but a temporary temporary

315
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:31,430
identities that could be used in place

316
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:32,780
of your permanent identities for

317
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:34,339
something like whenever you try it

318
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:36,770
whenever your phone is trying to connect

319
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:39,890
to the network it would obviously send

320
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:42,110
its temporary identity and this was

321
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:44,630
actually assigned by the network so this

322
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:46,520
could be used to to hide your identity

323
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:49,520
whenever you are sending your data over

324
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:51,829
the network in case a phone is not

325
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:55,130
having a temporary identity it could it

326
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:56,870
could also send its MC but this this

327
00:13:55,130 --> 00:13:58,700
rarely happens and it should not happen

328
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:00,590
because like it's there's no point of

329
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:02,210
using your permanent identities it's

330
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:04,610
like sending your public like like

331
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:08,990
private key to somebody so it's like

332
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:11,900
that so we found like so many issues

333
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:15,080
with operators like we tried different

334
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:16,670
networks because like I said this

335
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,280
identity is something that's being

336
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:22,339
assigned by the network operator to the

337
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,990
phone at different points like whenever

338
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:26,150
you turn on your phone and you turn it

339
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:28,340
on again it's common that your phone

340
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:31,040
receives a new identifier any new

341
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:32,690
temporary identifier we tried like

342
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,240
repeating this experiment on different

343
00:14:32,690 --> 00:14:37,850
networks like like here so I try to

344
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:41,690
attach my phone register it I get the

345
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:43,790
first temporary identity after maybe

346
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:45,770
five minutes I I repeat I turn it off

347
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:49,160
and then I turn on again it registers

348
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:50,990
and then it gets a new identity so the

349
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,120
thing here is like I think this is

350
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:57,590
something from from Germany and this is

351
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:59,690
something from Finland so we see that

352
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:01,250
the operators assigned you a temporary

353
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,950
identity actually this should be a

354
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:05,930
random number but we see some kind of

355
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:08,390
uniformity in this random number so

356
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:10,520
we're only the central digit is only

357
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:13,460
changing but the rest of the digits keep

358
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:15,530
keep on the same so which is not really

359
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:17,990
nice in terms of hiding somebody

360
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:19,910
somebody's identity over-the-air so this

361
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:22,490
actually allows to track a particular

362
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:27,319
purse a particular person's location in

363
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:29,150
a particular place for example like if I

364
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,710
if I am passively looking at the network

365
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:33,800
or like passively sniffing the network

366
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:35,900
if I see this identity today and if I

367
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,209
observe the same kind of

368
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,680
tomorrow it means that this person is

369
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:42,170
still wandering in this location or

370
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:45,229
somehow present in this location so it's

371
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:47,660
kind of leaking your course location but

372
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:50,420
not really precise so we wanted to go

373
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:52,430
more precise like okay by using this can

374
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:55,550
we can we get more precise location of

375
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:59,770
the user and compromise more privacy so

376
00:15:55,550 --> 00:16:02,300
then we went on with something like

377
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:06,140
measurement reports so these are nothing

378
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:07,880
but okay let's take a simple simple

379
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:10,250
simple case where when you are traveling

380
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,230
your phone is switching from one base

381
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,060
station to the other so and this happens

382
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:16,340
on the fly like you don't really notice

383
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:17,839
that there's some kind of disturbance in

384
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:22,010
between unless you have a power

385
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:24,100
connection so as you're traveling your

386
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:26,780
phone keeps sending something called

387
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,340
measurement reports to the network so

388
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:31,370
this campaign actually the information

389
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:34,340
of of all the signal strengths from the

390
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:35,900
nearby cells and their identities so

391
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:39,670
this is like a huge report with so much

392
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:42,980
of information that's actually telling

393
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:44,689
precise location of your phone and once

394
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:46,580
this report is received by the network

395
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:48,800
it verifies that appear so you are

396
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,450
actually going close to this tower so

397
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,280
maybe I can handle you to that

398
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:54,200
particular cover and then your call will

399
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:58,189
be shifted and then that's how it goes

400
00:16:54,200 --> 00:17:00,350
on according to the standard the 3gpp

401
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:03,140
like the standards body which is

402
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:04,760
responsible for making the the stand

403
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:09,379
that's like our FC for example at for

404
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:12,109
the Internet they have made in the

405
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:14,480
standards that this kind of reports can

406
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:17,060
actually be sent by the phone even in

407
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,220
without any authentication or security

408
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:21,520
so we try to exploit this bug and then

409
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:23,959
not not a bug but it's a standard block

410
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,629
we try to set up a rogue base station

411
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:28,970
like like an eensy catcher and then try

412
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:30,860
to collect and try to ask the phone to

413
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:32,480
send measurement report so the phone was

414
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,280
quickly sending its measurement reports

415
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,080
without even though like there was no

416
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,840
any kind of authentication or security

417
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,909
so we tried this on different phones

418
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,560
because it's the standard block all the

419
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,940
manufactures are like who are trying to

420
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,980
implement the standard so obviously

421
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:48,350
they'll implement are actually affected

422
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:49,580
with this vulnerability then we found

423
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:52,129
something called

424
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:54,500
a ratings failure report the the kind of

425
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:55,850
functionality is similar between radio

426
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:58,760
link failure reports and measurement

427
00:17:55,850 --> 00:18:00,679
reports like the for example like when

428
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:03,410
you are going to and when you are inside

429
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:05,510
and escalate in an elevator like maybe

430
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:08,360
sometimes like your call is dropped or

431
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:10,550
you have like poor signal coverage so

432
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:14,719
this is some new feature that got

433
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:16,070
introduced into LT so whenever there's a

434
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,810
poor connection underwritten there's a

435
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,760
radio link failure like you lost the

436
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:23,419
connection but the phone would

437
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:25,070
automatically create a report and this

438
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:27,440
report actually contains like all the

439
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:29,929
information from nearby cell towers and

440
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,960
also like on which particular cell or

441
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:35,180
base station this this kind of poor

442
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,980
coverage was happening so that once the

443
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:40,040
operator receives this kind of report we

444
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:42,020
can actually use it to to troubleshoot

445
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:44,659
like signal coverage issues or improve

446
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,760
the coverage and I mean ultimately the

447
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:51,590
purpose is to like make the network much

448
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:54,260
better in terms of performance according

449
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:55,850
to the standard we see that it's it's

450
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:58,340
it's kind of like mandatory to have

451
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:01,129
security for this kind of reports but

452
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:03,530
but we found that most of the vendors

453
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:07,130
are not really implementing security for

454
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:08,810
like no like we don't know like why they

455
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:11,800
didn't implement security for this kind

456
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:16,340
of messages there was no reason for that

457
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:18,649
and we try to exploit this so we could

458
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:21,350
actually receive reports from all the

459
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:24,830
phones and try to use this information

460
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:26,510
so after this we moved one step ahead we

461
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:28,689
wanted to see like if it's possible okay

462
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:33,230
okay this reports can actually carry

463
00:19:28,690 --> 00:19:35,540
your GPS like with respect to Y of your

464
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:38,810
enabling or disabling in your Android or

465
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:41,090
your iOS because like the baseband which

466
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:46,280
is sitting below or the master of your

467
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:49,550
phone has more access to the the GPS

468
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:51,920
chip compared to your Android or iOS so

469
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:54,070
we thought that okay maybe we can send a

470
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,960
GPS request to the phone and then try to

471
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:59,240
get back a GPS coordinate from the phone

472
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,790
without actually using any kind of

473
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,450
security or authentication so so this is

474
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:05,158
like I'm on LTE

475
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:08,760
then I'm an attacker and I don't have

476
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:10,610
any kind of keys and I can send like an

477
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:14,039
establish a base station and try to send

478
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:17,840
a GPS request to the phone over the air

479
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:17,840
and I can actually receive the GPS

480
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:50,380
[Music]

481
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:03,660
LTE so all the IP data messages that are

482
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:05,570
being sent from your phone are not

483
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,920
integrated protected so which means that

484
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:10,320
even if a man-in-the-middle actually

485
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:12,660
modifies this message there is no

486
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,370
mechanism to actually verify by the

487
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:16,950
network it was not defined in the

488
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:20,429
standards thinking that okay most of NLT

489
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:21,930
like people are mostly using apps and I

490
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:25,080
think it's the responsibility of the

491
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:30,210
apps to actually considered about data

492
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:31,649
modification but if but like these guys

493
00:21:30,210 --> 00:21:34,020
thought okay so this is the thing let's

494
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:36,900
let's let's see if we can crack the DNS

495
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:38,460
part so whenever your phone is accessing

496
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,560
your web page obviously it would send a

497
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,330
DNS request and usually there's a

498
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:45,330
certain kind of and these DNS are like

499
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:48,780
HTTP so even though if it if a packet is

500
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:51,600
like encrypted and its head GDP and it's

501
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:53,399
DNS so that if you can observe the kind

502
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:57,179
of pattern between all these DNS

503
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:59,340
received packets it's possible to modify

504
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:01,170
certain bits in that so that you can

505
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:04,919
actually divert the DNS request to your

506
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:06,750
fake DNS server like I said there is no

507
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,040
verification of or like there's no

508
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:11,400
protection against man-in-the-middle

509
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:13,170
attacks only for the user data but the

510
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:16,800
control plane data is actually protected

511
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:20,940
so so all the IP traffic can actually be

512
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:22,379
hijacked by this kind of attack so these

513
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:24,240
are some of the issues related to

514
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,770
privacy then moving on to availability

515
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:28,320
it's nothing but like denial of service

516
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:30,030
we know that most of the stingrays they

517
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,790
actually operate based on the principle

518
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:35,340
that they can downgrade from 4G to

519
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:37,770
coogee like since most of the attacks

520
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:40,199
are somehow difficult or LTE it's

521
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:43,379
possible that you bring the audio Jam 4G

522
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:45,090
network and then you bring so obviously

523
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:49,280
the user would move to seize your 2g

524
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:49,280
network making the attacks more simple

525
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,910
so we tried like three three different

526
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:56,370
attacks and the last one is something

527
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:58,530
that's actually targeting the network

528
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:00,629
not not targeting the phone like with a

529
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:02,040
board trying so many attacks on the

530
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:04,170
phones and we wanted to shift the focus

531
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,820
so we thought okay network why not

532
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:08,940
target the net worth instead of phones

533
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:10,939
because like targeting a targeting a

534
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:13,080
network is more

535
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:15,210
challenging but it's if the impact is

536
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:19,530
even more when you are targeting a group

537
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:22,650
of phones so the first attack we tried

538
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:26,428
was like based on a certain message so

539
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:28,559
there's something called a tracking area

540
00:23:26,429 --> 00:23:31,530
pet reject message in understand that's

541
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:35,510
defined so if you can actually send this

542
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:38,570
message to the phone with the particular

543
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:41,340
with a particular called something like

544
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:42,840
LTE and non-lp service is not allowed so

545
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:45,510
when you send this message to the phone

546
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,129
what the phone does is like it and it

547
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:49,860
immediately enters into emergency mode

548
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:53,130
so and it doesn't regain normal service

549
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:55,678
until you restart the phone or in some

550
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:57,179
cases like until you remove the remove

551
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,730
the SIM card and then reinsert it again

552
00:23:57,179 --> 00:24:01,980
so this is kind of like a denial of like

553
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:03,750
persistent Dass because like the user

554
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:05,549
doesn't really know that okay this kind

555
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:07,559
of message transaction has been happened

556
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:10,049
between the phone and the network so

557
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:11,879
it's kind of like silent and it requires

558
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:17,370
reboot of the phone to to get back

559
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:17,520
normal service then there's the second

560
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:20,159
one

561
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,290
like downgrading the user from 4G to 2 G

562
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:25,230
so there are like some special messages

563
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:27,480
called hard are series I'm not for it

564
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:28,799
basically it's clear but something

565
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,870
called our RC release where you can

566
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:34,350
actually specify a particular frequency

567
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:36,330
of 2g network and you can actually kick

568
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:38,730
the phone from a 4G network to a 2g

569
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:40,168
network and the once the phone is on 2g

570
00:24:38,730 --> 00:24:42,030
I think like we can do lots of stuff

571
00:24:40,169 --> 00:24:44,340
like without we can actually bypass

572
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:46,260
encryption and don't do authentication

573
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:48,000
and then you have like plaintext

574
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:49,890
exchange traffic between the phone and

575
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,679
the network so it's like taking down

576
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:54,270
everything maybe sometimes user might

577
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:56,370
notice that ok why I'm not getting the

578
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:58,650
4G service why I'm on I am like why my

579
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:02,250
phone is sitting on 2g so maybe feels

580
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:04,610
like aware of such things but I ok he

581
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:07,010
cannot detect these things on the phone

582
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:09,540
[Music]

583
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:13,919
then the third one is like poisoning the

584
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:16,440
BTS so like I showed before they were

585
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,780
like the phones are sending something

586
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,120
like measurement reports and radio link

587
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:22,950
failure reports so these reports are

588
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,600
actually collected from the phones and

589
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:27,380
are accumulated in the net

590
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:30,870
so whenever there's a failure and then

591
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:34,800
the phone tries to send a report and the

592
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:37,020
the base station or or the whole network

593
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,550
try to accumulate and save the support

594
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,650
and later use it for like

595
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:43,290
troubleshooting network coverage issues

596
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:45,080
so let's say on a particular base

597
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:48,120
station if it's really performing bad

598
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:50,580
like if it's accumulating maybe thousand

599
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,169
reports per day which is some kind of

600
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:56,939
somewhat like a severe issue because

601
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:59,340
like the wood I mean the performance

602
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,630
like the KPIs are something like the

603
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:03,959
performance indicators are something

604
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:06,120
like it should be 96 percent or some

605
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:08,220
some when the documents show that it

606
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,110
should have a performance of like 97

607
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:12,660
percent which means that you can drop

608
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:14,760
maybe ten or fifteen calls per day but

609
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:16,740
that's too much but for some operators

610
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:19,860
like it could be different depending on

611
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:23,640
the place where they install that base

612
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:26,729
station so what we tried is like we try

613
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:29,040
to create such radio link failure

614
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:30,660
situation we try to create such scenario

615
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:33,860
to the phone and make the phone

616
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:36,720
experience the radio link failure and

617
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:38,459
make the phones to send thousands of

618
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,610
such reports to the network and the

619
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:44,010
network actually blindly trust these

620
00:26:41,610 --> 00:26:47,310
reports and try to use it to control the

621
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:51,390
settings so in some documents like some

622
00:26:47,310 --> 00:26:53,760
base stations we try we played so if the

623
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:55,890
phone is like if the performance is

624
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:57,570
dropping below 96 percent they would

625
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:59,760
actually blacklist that particular base

626
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:01,830
station which means that they won't

627
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,750
allow any kind of handover to that

628
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:05,310
particular base station or in worst

629
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:08,280
cases like they could really turn off

630
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:10,950
that base station and try to maybe

631
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:13,379
install a different one or or send a

632
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:15,870
service service guy or somebody like to

633
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:19,140
repair that base station this is

634
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:21,989
something with it again some protocols

635
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,010
called self-organizing networks I don't

636
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:25,200
know if you are interested you can

637
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:29,760
actually Google about self-organizing

638
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:31,680
networks and some attacks on that ok

639
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:36,090
these are some of the set up we use

640
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:38,190
mostly we well we like since I'm doing

641
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:39,689
and I can make research like we have to

642
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:41,730
be a bit more open so we have to use

643
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:44,429
something that's available in the open

644
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:46,320
source area so that like for example

645
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:49,350
like we use software's like opens open

646
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,509
LT and SRS LT to demonstrate like proof

647
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:53,519
of concept attack because like the the

648
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:56,549
problem with operating such such devices

649
00:27:53,519 --> 00:28:00,440
is like it's illegal to operate an MC

650
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:03,600
catcher unless you have a legalized

651
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:05,669
permission or or you purchased a

652
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,090
particular frequency to operate in that

653
00:28:05,669 --> 00:28:11,330
in that region this is some of the man

654
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:15,330
the middle setups and then we try to

655
00:28:11,330 --> 00:28:16,470
keep the cost of the attack low I was

656
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,449
doing training and then people were

657
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:23,039
asking me like can you can you use like

658
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:25,529
lime str because device like us RP costs

659
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:28,139
a lot so the line str is something

660
00:28:25,529 --> 00:28:30,899
that's really cheap like maybe $200 or

661
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:32,879
something but this one comes around 1200

662
00:28:30,899 --> 00:28:35,039
so there's a huge cost difference but

663
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:36,928
with the huge cost difference also comes

664
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:47,129
the capability so with this you can

665
00:28:36,929 --> 00:28:49,230
actually do more compared to this one it

666
00:28:47,129 --> 00:28:51,178
catches like prevailing in LT like why

667
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:53,250
are they still existing so basically

668
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:55,950
like I can go get back to two reasons

669
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:57,809
why because the thing is like the phone

670
00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:00,330
always wants to connect to a strong

671
00:28:57,809 --> 00:29:02,158
tower so whenever is yeah like even

672
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:04,980
though you if you are not using your

673
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:07,350
phone your phone is constantly listening

674
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:09,480
to so many cell phone towers nearby and

675
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:10,889
just keep keep observing like okay which

676
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,990
one is the strongest one and then maybe

677
00:29:10,889 --> 00:29:15,809
I can connect to it or switch to other

678
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:17,879
one so if you can operate one such base

679
00:29:15,809 --> 00:29:22,049
station with a strong power you can

680
00:29:17,879 --> 00:29:24,990
actually attract so many phones this is

681
00:29:22,049 --> 00:29:27,000
like trying to attract the phone then

682
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:28,980
after this like okay you can ask me like

683
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,490
okay there is something called mutual

684
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:34,470
authentication in 3G and 4G there are

685
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:37,799
like so many security algorithms or like

686
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:39,659
they are using AES and they're using so

687
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:41,100
much but but why again like we still

688
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:43,500
have the security attacks or like

689
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:47,669
privacy or or something that affecting

690
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:49,559
the denial of service the thing is like

691
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:51,690
in the standards and implementations

692
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:53,340
there are like certain messages that

693
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:55,500
could be actually used even though if

694
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:58,139
there is no no authentication and no

695
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,760
security so in that case an attacker

696
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:02,309
like who has knowledge of these

697
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,559
protocols and who has knowledge of some

698
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:06,510
implementation and access to such

699
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:12,210
devices can really perform such attacks

700
00:30:06,510 --> 00:30:16,049
and really cause a huge impact so

701
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:18,150
regarding the status so we try to like

702
00:30:16,049 --> 00:30:20,610
before going going public or like before

703
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:22,950
trying to inform so many authorities or

704
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:25,770
like vendor we try to play with so many

705
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:27,840
devices I mean luckily like we don't

706
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:29,820
have to deal with thousands of companies

707
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:36,178
like it's good that we deal with some of

708
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:37,980
them and then you you do good so at

709
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:39,330
least some of the attacks we tested like

710
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:42,120
they are applicable to most of the

711
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:43,580
networks worldwide whenever like we

712
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,280
travel to conference like we try to

713
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:49,110
collect traces from different networks

714
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:50,639
for example like let's take maybe every

715
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:55,280
country has like at least three

716
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:58,590
operators or sometimes like only two so

717
00:30:55,280 --> 00:31:01,049
along with that like not recently but

718
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:03,090
like the basement vendors they started

719
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:04,650
to have something called like like the

720
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:06,959
vulnerability disclosure programs like

721
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:11,880
which are already existing in Android or

722
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:13,860
or I was like like for so many years so

723
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:15,470
we try to inform them about these parks

724
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:19,799
and try to discuss like what are the

725
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:21,570
practical implications of this and when

726
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:22,770
it comes to a standard implementation or

727
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:26,490
like when it when it comes to the

728
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:28,260
standard law it takes a lot of effort to

729
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:30,540
convince somebody from the standard that

730
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:33,240
this is a really a problem and we don't

731
00:31:30,540 --> 00:31:36,540
fix it like there are a lot of impacts

732
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:38,370
which which might arise then we have

733
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:41,340
some some friendly organization called

734
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:42,899
GSM a it's nothing but an alliance of so

735
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:47,120
many operators worldwide so they try to

736
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:49,679
help us and distribute our work so that

737
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:51,330
you receive comments or like cross

738
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,220
questions from different operators like

739
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:53,668
sometimes they are not agreeing what you

740
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,950
are saying

741
00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:58,590
so when you try to convince them and

742
00:31:55,950 --> 00:32:00,179
then try to answer them so you can

743
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:01,350
really create a huge impact going

744
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:04,500
through this kind

745
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:07,469
disclosure program and 3gpp the standard

746
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:09,000
body recently they started to have some

747
00:32:07,470 --> 00:32:11,610
kind of vulnerability disclosure program

748
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,840
so which could also be interesting to

749
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:16,918
use if you are doing some kind of

750
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:18,629
cellular security research ok what's the

751
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:20,400
status now like what's the thing now

752
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:22,470
like with the new phones like we have

753
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,570
iPhone X or like some some new phones

754
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:31,140
like can we can we consider that like

755
00:32:24,570 --> 00:32:34,889
they are secure yes at least iPhones

756
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:36,360
which we usually test somehow taking the

757
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:38,789
privacy and the availability issues

758
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:40,918
seriously so they try to contact us and

759
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:43,770
then like see what can be done to

760
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:45,750
actually fix or sometimes like some some

761
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:48,059
flaws are not really like they cannot be

762
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:50,400
really fixed unless you do major changes

763
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:57,270
so maybe they could be a workaround to

764
00:32:50,400 --> 00:33:00,179
actually fix those issues like I said

765
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:04,139
like the IBI um maybe if you buy a phone

766
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:06,450
from 2018 it's not possible to receive

767
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:08,370
the IMEI of a particular phone unless

768
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:10,980
you have proper authentication and then

769
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:13,949
security I'm talking about LTE but these

770
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:16,380
attacks are still possible on 2g but but

771
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:17,549
anyway it's old and it's already like so

772
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:23,190
much of research there so we are not

773
00:33:17,549 --> 00:33:24,929
interesting in that then coming to use a

774
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:28,020
data integrity protection which I was

775
00:33:24,929 --> 00:33:30,570
talking about DNS hijacking this issue

776
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:33,000
is actually fixed in 5g and it's really

777
00:33:30,570 --> 00:33:35,250
difficult to fix in 4G so you can expect

778
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,559
like all the user plain data is

779
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:41,730
integrity protected in 5g so this is a

780
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:45,600
major change in 5g okay regarding the

781
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:47,789
availability like I said the attacker

782
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:50,939
like whenever he tries to send a message

783
00:33:47,789 --> 00:33:52,710
to create a Dass on the phone like the

784
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:56,820
user has to manually restart the phone

785
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:59,370
but there's a workaround that there's a

786
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:01,710
timer which actually allows the phone to

787
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:03,928
reconnect to the network whenever the

788
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:05,850
phone receives such a message because

789
00:34:03,929 --> 00:34:08,520
this is also important for low-power iot

790
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:11,029
devices because like sometimes you place

791
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:14,620
I were 2 devices somewhere far away and

792
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:16,540
cannot be manually like

793
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:18,130
elected or like operated so for such

794
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:20,110
devices it's really important that there

795
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:24,550
should be some kind of timer to Auto

796
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:27,070
reconnect to the network then for the

797
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:29,620
redirection like bringing if a user from

798
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:31,120
42 to G you actually need some kind of

799
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:34,120
authentication message or like

800
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:37,960
authentication procedures to do such

801
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:39,699
attack actually and this a nice study

802
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,040
like at least finally the 3gpp is

803
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:44,169
actually considering to actually deal

804
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:47,139
the problem of fake base stations this

805
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:50,530
problem has been in 2g 3G and 4G and I

806
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:52,779
think it will also be in 5g so there is

807
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:55,630
some nice work which is going on in CCPP

808
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:58,540
standards like about what are the proper

809
00:34:55,630 --> 00:35:00,520
solutions to actually deal with these

810
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:02,259
fake base stations I mean nothing is

811
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,720
finalized yet but it's it's a study

812
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,400
going on and they consider different

813
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:10,509
solutions and which one is best so

814
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:12,520
according to that they proceed maybe

815
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:14,380
like you might think like okay if I I'm

816
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,450
a user like I'm a normal phone user and

817
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:17,950
then I want to protect from this kind of

818
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:20,169
privacy attacks or like availability

819
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:22,810
attack there are some applications like

820
00:35:20,170 --> 00:35:24,720
Android apps which could be installed on

821
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:26,920
the phone and then they try to

822
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:31,120
continuously monitor like such attacks

823
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:33,550
but somewhere in 2017 we actually tested

824
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:34,870
all of the applications I don't know if

825
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:40,230
you are familiar with this slopes niche

826
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:42,580
it's actually in a tool from SR labs and

827
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:44,950
some of the applications like that shirt

828
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:47,740
or even there are Android in secret so

829
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:50,259
detector something like this but we try

830
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:52,689
to test this application by actually

831
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:54,570
operating MZ caches and the most of the

832
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:56,680
applications really fail in detecting

833
00:35:54,570 --> 00:36:01,360
simple reason is like they are open

834
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:05,950
source and the free so there's not much

835
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:07,870
research put into that we also tested

836
00:36:05,950 --> 00:36:09,129
some commercial applications like for

837
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:12,220
example there's a company called

838
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:15,100
gsm k the the build some military apps

839
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:18,759
and we try to test em she catches on on

840
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:20,500
their MC catcher detectors but there are

841
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,530
still so many issues that acts that are

842
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:25,420
actually not solved in in the place of

843
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:27,460
in c catcher detectors we're actually

844
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,799
coming up with a new tool that can

845
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:31,000
actually help

846
00:36:28,799 --> 00:36:34,299
normal phone users like to actually

847
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,339
detect attacks on the 4G phones because

848
00:36:34,299 --> 00:36:39,700
there is no detection yet available for

849
00:36:36,339 --> 00:36:42,430
4G phones like I said okay this is some

850
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:44,140
some reference to to the fake base

851
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:46,210
station work that's been going on in

852
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:50,038
3gpp maybe if you are interested you can

853
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:50,039
just take a look on the door

854
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,500
okay what's boarding 5g like is 5g going

855
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:58,660
to solve all the problems or what is

856
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,430
just the hype in the market okay

857
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:03,129
at least your SIM identity is protected

858
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:06,339
your phone identity is protected and

859
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:08,099
your user plain data is protected so at

860
00:37:06,339 --> 00:37:11,230
least there is certain level of

861
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:13,240
protection is being considered from

862
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:15,579
rogue base stations but still the

863
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,788
problem is not as solved and there

864
00:37:15,579 --> 00:37:20,980
should there's actually a lot to do

865
00:37:17,789 --> 00:37:23,619
from the basement vendors perspective

866
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:26,140
like you could use a proprietary

867
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:27,760
solution and put it in your baseline so

868
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:30,730
that that's actually detecting all the

869
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,910
attacks but but still like I would say

870
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:38,140
like there is a lot of scope and work

871
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:41,828
still pending in that section okay

872
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:44,740
takeaways is like if she catches will

873
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:47,859
still exist in 5g but maybe they won't

874
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:51,189
be able to catch the AMC but still

875
00:37:47,859 --> 00:37:53,500
they'll be able to do some other attacks

876
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:56,230
like some of the new attacks or for new

877
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:58,900
ways so you still have to wait and see

878
00:37:56,230 --> 00:38:03,309
because like we will not have a real 5g

879
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:05,259
Network until 2021 or or in practically

880
00:38:03,309 --> 00:38:09,400
like I would say it will take like 2022

881
00:38:05,259 --> 00:38:13,950
to have a fight G network like as

882
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:16,720
deployed as an LTE network or even more

883
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:18,490
and apart from that like we talked about

884
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:22,689
like I would be these taste very very

885
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:24,459
often the the cool thing is like

886
00:38:22,690 --> 00:38:26,109
nowadays like I would devices are being

887
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:27,640
integrated into the mobile network so

888
00:38:26,109 --> 00:38:30,460
you can actually control them through

889
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:32,500
mobile app and when you are integrating

890
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:34,480
such devices into the mobile network

891
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:37,079
layer you really have to be careful in

892
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,970
terms of implementing implementing your

893
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:42,119
applications on the IOT devices so you

894
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:44,910
cannot completely or

895
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:46,890
lightly depend on mobile network

896
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:51,960
security and then just they can neglect

897
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:54,660
the application level security I can say

898
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:56,730
like at least the kind of testing we do

899
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:58,759
I can say like a phone that's really

900
00:38:56,730 --> 00:39:01,559
stood in 2019 his at least is somehow

901
00:38:58,759 --> 00:39:06,089
safe from most of the attacks actually

902
00:39:01,559 --> 00:39:07,470
mentioned in this talk yeah though

903
00:39:06,089 --> 00:39:20,160
that's the end of the top and then if

904
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:22,609
you have questions or please okay so

905
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:25,140
let's talk about like you're making a

906
00:39:22,609 --> 00:39:27,328
like yeah yeah yeah you're browsing the

907
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,710
web page like so there's a man in the

908
00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:34,589
middle

909
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:36,749
who's yeah I mean that's what like you

910
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:38,099
operate a base station like a man in the

911
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:42,240
middle is nothing but it's operating a

912
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:46,200
base station plus a phone so like maybe

913
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:48,508
if you if you see this one like it's

914
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,160
operating a base station on one side and

915
00:39:48,509 --> 00:39:52,349
it's also operating a four on the other

916
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,899
side so whatever this is a victim phone

917
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:56,849
so it comes to this one and then through

918
00:39:54,900 --> 00:40:02,670
this it actually passes on to the

919
00:39:56,849 --> 00:40:05,220
network no no they're not going that way

920
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:07,140
but so most of the attacks we are doing

921
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:09,769
are actually on the head interface

922
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:17,848
that's the main interesting point for me

923
00:40:09,769 --> 00:40:21,029
yeah okay I would go with USRP even

924
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:23,849
though if it's expensive there could be

925
00:40:21,029 --> 00:40:28,440
like two reasons it's stable compared to

926
00:40:23,849 --> 00:40:30,089
blade RF and other devices and the some

927
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:32,130
like some of the open source software

928
00:40:30,089 --> 00:40:34,710
which which are available for research

929
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:37,980
on the internet like they mostly are

930
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:39,480
using USRP so when you buy a blade RF

931
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,619
and then you're looking for the software

932
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:44,190
and you're actually missing the drivers

933
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:46,109
so so you have to put additional effort

934
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:48,180
to integrate the driver into the

935
00:40:46,109 --> 00:40:50,249
software and then use the application so

936
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:52,500
why do you want to take this extra

937
00:40:50,249 --> 00:41:10,319
effort sir

938
00:40:52,500 --> 00:41:10,320
[Music]

939
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,140
actually the base station which an

940
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:35,670
attacker is operating he's never

941
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:38,848
connected to the real network yeah so

942
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:40,619
this is a wireless medium so everybody

943
00:41:38,849 --> 00:41:44,220
who has an antenna has the right to

944
00:41:40,619 --> 00:41:45,810
transmit so and somebody knowing the

945
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:48,839
frequency can actually transmit so

946
00:41:45,810 --> 00:41:50,339
there's no way unless you have the

947
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:52,770
proper detection ways for example

948
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:54,660
jamming could be detected jamming is

949
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:56,550
nothing but some kind of noisy signal

950
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:58,500
that could be detected but your offer

951
00:41:56,550 --> 00:42:00,930
if you are operating in a proper LTE

952
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:02,450
signal which is a legitimate signal so

953
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:05,759
even though if the network operator is

954
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:07,740
we are listening to the signal you might

955
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:15,150
end up thinking that this is a normal

956
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:25,500
signal and you can just avoid it in

957
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:27,720
Siegen aha they have access to the

958
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,940
diagnostic logs so all the messages

959
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:32,730
coming from so to install such

960
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:34,440
applications you need a rooted phone or

961
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:37,980
some phones like which come with this

962
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:40,020
diagnosis so they key they continuously

963
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:42,210
monitor for like monitor reading this

964
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:43,830
messages so based on this for example

965
00:42:42,210 --> 00:42:46,400
like if they receive something like

966
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:48,839
paging with MC this is something not

967
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,599
very common in the normal network this

968
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:53,630
is something malicious network so this

969
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:56,310
is one way of detecting but still

970
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:58,320
because like the whole base band is a

971
00:42:56,310 --> 00:43:00,990
huge state machine and you cannot just

972
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:03,270
detect based only few few parameters or

973
00:43:00,990 --> 00:43:05,490
you have to consider a lot to actually

974
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:07,200
detect properly detect an instigator or

975
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:10,500
else like you end up

976
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:13,848
giving false positives and which will

977
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,849
actually annoy the user so
