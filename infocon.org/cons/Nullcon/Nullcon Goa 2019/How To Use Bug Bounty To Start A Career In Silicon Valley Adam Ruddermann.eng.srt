watch floor for US Cyber Command as it

34
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,029
was transitioning from the Defense

35
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,520
Information Systems agency to NSA

36
00:01:27,029 --> 00:01:33,060
control it was work for Booz Allen

Hamilton of Edward Snowden Fame I did

38
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:37,349
various things across the intelligence

39
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:39,479
community and consulting capacity got a

40
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:42,179
little bit tired of DC government work

41
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,289
and was one of the early employees of

42
00:01:42,179 --> 00:01:44,999
Cenac which most of you have probably

43
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:47,099
heard of is one of the big three bug

44
00:01:44,999 --> 00:01:49,999
Valley startups I was the original

45
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:53,729
triage er person X so if you were

46
00:01:49,999 --> 00:01:54,679
something Cenac very early on hi nice to

47
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:59,340
meet you finally

48
00:01:54,679 --> 00:02:00,450
I went on from there to Facebook I did I

49
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,709
was not hired for bug bounty by

50
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:03,060
eventually ran it was the technical

51
00:02:01,709 --> 00:02:04,799
program manager for its bug bounty

52
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:06,869
program I did a bunch other stuff there

53
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,849
too like user gave protection and my

54
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,370
lifecycle management and cool stuff like

55
00:02:08,848 --> 00:02:13,799
that but my claim to fame is being the

56
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,260
the TPM for the bug bounty program and

57
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:17,879
then I was invited to take over the bug

58
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:22,500
services practice at mcc group which

59
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:23,849
exists pre-existed me NCC group is one

60
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,430
of the original players in the bug

61
00:02:23,849 --> 00:02:27,869
bounty space both are very quiet usually

62
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:31,829
this is it a consultative staff

63
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:34,709
augmentation capacity supporting bug

64
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:37,230
bounty programs if you have Schmitt to

65
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:39,180
one of the larger blood bank programs on

66
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,399
hacker one there's a very very very good

67
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,650
chance that you have been you've dealt

68
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,799
with one of my folks at some point in

69
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:47,819
your blood dining careers at NCC but we

70
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:50,760
don't just do that we're a global

71
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:53,280
company based in UK and we offer a whole

72
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:56,209
bunch of security services we try to

73
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,769
make bug gonna fit in that correctly so

74
00:02:56,209 --> 00:03:00,299
just in case anyone in the room here has

75
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:01,730
no idea what I'm talking about about bug

76
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:05,340
bounty amber - a really quick overview

77
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:07,470
so what is bug bounty security

78
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,230
researchers or white hats or hackers or

79
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:12,079
Millennials go and they are using

80
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,480
products and they find security bugs

81
00:03:12,079 --> 00:03:18,420
okay they then report it in a

82
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,638
responsible way to the organization that

83
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,768
owns that product and tell them about

84
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:25,379
the bug and give them time to fix the

85
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:27,900
bug before anyone tell it before they

86
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:29,790
tell anyone else about it so that no one

87
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:33,269
is affected by the bug and then

88
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:35,310
depending upon the company and the bug

89
00:03:33,269 --> 00:03:36,840
bounty or disclosure program they may or

90
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,099
may not get a monetary award they might

91
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:40,319
get a t-shirt that might get

92
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:41,668
reputational points but the general

93
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,470
model is like you have a whole crowd of

94
00:03:41,669 --> 00:03:45,030
people around the world trying to find

95
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,859
some tree bugs and being responsible

96
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:53,370
with that information and not using it

97
00:03:46,859 --> 00:03:55,799
for bad so what well nowadays that's not

98
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,599
that cool idea now has many big name

99
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:01,019
logos like the ones you recognize here

100
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:04,530
running these programs and so doing bug

101
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:07,250
bounty being begun is now become a norm

102
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:10,590
in the security testing business and

103
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:13,379
excuse me and as companies mature

104
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,690
internally and get better at fixing bugs

105
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:18,449
and get better at figuring out how to

106
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:21,029
leverage the crowdsource community

107
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:22,680
they're adding bug bounty as one aspect

108
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:24,599
of many and their security testing

109
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,099
strategy and there's some really great

110
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:28,800
examples of why this is happening here's

111
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:30,029
a fun example of tokens being leaked by

112
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,639
github

113
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:34,379
and github by a snapchat this was a

114
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,949
disco publicly disclosed bug on hyper

115
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:39,089
one this researcher found in seven hours

116
00:04:37,949 --> 00:04:41,009
after it happened

117
00:04:39,089 --> 00:04:42,479
that's an amazing turnaround time that's

118
00:04:41,009 --> 00:04:44,099
like incredible that's very impressive

119
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,409
and this is the value people are seeing

120
00:04:44,099 --> 00:04:49,378
a bug bonnie and i personally fifteen

121
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:52,319
grand off of it like not too bad it's a

122
00:04:49,379 --> 00:04:53,429
pretty good day at work right I used to

123
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:55,949
work a Facebook so I'm a little biased

124
00:04:53,429 --> 00:04:58,049
towards that we paid this happened while

125
00:04:55,949 --> 00:05:00,330
I was there we paid $10,000 for a kid to

126
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:01,919
ten-year-old in Finland that's awesome

127
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:03,599
like that's life-changing and hopefully

128
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,308
that person goes into security he got to

129
00:05:03,599 --> 00:05:07,319
be the prime minister of Finland it's

130
00:05:05,309 --> 00:05:09,509
pretty cool for a ten-year-old and

131
00:05:07,319 --> 00:05:11,189
Facebook since leaving has expanded what

132
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:12,539
they do for bug banning to include user

133
00:05:11,189 --> 00:05:14,009
data abuse which is great this is a

134
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:16,019
really great use of the community and

135
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:17,399
frankly that's why I've been here for so

136
00:05:16,019 --> 00:05:18,809
I've come here for so many years because

137
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:25,589
the Indian research community is so

138
00:05:18,809 --> 00:05:26,819
integral to the bug bounty industry and

139
00:05:25,589 --> 00:05:28,289
peelers getting paid a lot of money

140
00:05:26,819 --> 00:05:30,240
there's a lot of money this is a real

141
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:32,519
business this is a real profession and

142
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,949
there's a tons of opportunity and in it

143
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:36,659
and you know what the only person that's

144
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:38,279
necessary for you start being successful

145
00:05:36,659 --> 00:05:40,919
in bug bounties yourself which is

146
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:43,229
personally I grew up I was almost one

147
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:44,399
time in my life I grow very poor and so

148
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:45,930
that's why I love bug Valley because all

149
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:47,309
you need is you and your own motivation

150
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,019
effort you can do make a lot of money

151
00:05:47,309 --> 00:05:52,169
and really get somewhere in life it's

152
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:53,669
really cool so hopefully I've pissed you

153
00:05:52,169 --> 00:05:55,469
on the emotional part and like you're

154
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:59,789
sold so now you're wondering like where

155
00:05:55,469 --> 00:06:01,199
do I start maybe so I don't know if you

156
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:03,568
all were here for Jason Haddix is

157
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,849
fantastic talk it's like awesome I've

158
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:07,499
seen I've seen it for three years now if

159
00:06:05,849 --> 00:06:10,019
you didn't get to sit in it I recommend

160
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:11,610
watching it later on the recording but

161
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:13,289
for the purposes of talking grass team

162
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:14,819
we don't really know a lot what's going

163
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,709
on but and this is just a first interest

164
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:18,179
so sorry if I'm boring like more expert

165
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:21,569
folks here so let's say you're still

166
00:06:18,179 --> 00:06:22,589
learning first you got to start basic

167
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:23,819
let's start with something where there's

168
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:25,439
guidance something where there's a

169
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:27,719
template you can follow and you can

170
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:29,339
learn to start with learning what the

171
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:31,439
Olaf's top-10 is if you don't know what

172
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:32,699
I'm talking about just google it trust

173
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:35,069
me it's a big deal in the security

174
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:36,329
industry but what this means effectively

175
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:38,669
is you start learning secrete testing a

176
00:06:36,329 --> 00:06:40,529
web and mobile web products and mobile

177
00:06:38,669 --> 00:06:44,389
ap is it's the most technically

178
00:06:40,529 --> 00:06:44,389
straightforward place to start trust me

179
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,220
the nice thing about also is that many

180
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,380
of the bugs from a blackbox testing

181
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:52,090
perspective look very very similar so

182
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,320
you can start becoming an expert in

183
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,219
cross-site scripting and then let you

184
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,990
feel like you're comfortable with that

185
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:57,220
you can start learning more about sequel

186
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,380
injection and then you can start

187
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,480
learning about CSRF bugs and so on and

188
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,969
so forth you can start growing your

189
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,740
security knowledge at your own pace

190
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:08,320
while at the same time finding very

191
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:09,670
valid and impactful security bugs even

192
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:13,750
if you don't have that comprehensive

193
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:15,220
knowledge net that's great but it key

194
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,480
part of that besides just learning

195
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,580
cross-site scripting in sequel injection

196
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:20,290
in the light is actually learning a

197
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,479
comprehensive security testing

198
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:24,820
methodology like how does a pen testing

199
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:27,160
company like NCC Group when we get hired

200
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:29,440
to do a two-week pen test for a web

201
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,419
product how do we actually guarantee

202
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,440
that we're writing sufficient coverage

203
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:34,479
that were actually testing the entire

204
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:37,060
product the way that we say we will

205
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:40,570
there's a method to the madness there's

206
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:43,360
a stepwise process that we follow and

207
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:45,099
many of these processes in various forms

208
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,900
are on the internet and available for

209
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:51,250
you to learn Oh ASP again actually has a

210
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,570
really solid reference for gray's

211
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,919
testing methodologies that you can

212
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:56,169
google so if you were to move like a

213
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,969
wasp security testing methodologies

214
00:07:56,169 --> 00:07:59,560
they'll absolutely be the first hit on

215
00:07:57,970 --> 00:08:03,160
Google I tested it before I put it on

216
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,600
here but if you just google for security

217
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,950
test methodologies in general you'll

218
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,570
find a lot I'm not specifically

219
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:09,219
referencing one because I don't think

220
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,010
that any of them are perfect they each

221
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,240
have their own different perspective and

222
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:15,580
approach to things especially from a

223
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,830
technical perspective and so I think

224
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:20,440
this is an area where it's really about

225
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,150
learning the mental approach and day to

226
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,190
day methods of actually doing security

227
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:26,799
testing which Jason actually covered a

228
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:29,469
bit in his talk as well and I recommend

229
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,049
checking that out but it's really

230
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:33,460
important for if you want to like

231
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:34,478
actually get a job out of this instead

232
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,740
of just finding bugs and getting paid

233
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,710
for about ants which is great but if you

234
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,640
actually want to train us into a job

235
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:41,169
understanding a comprehensive

236
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,429
methodology is critical because a

237
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:43,949
company like our hire you because you're

238
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:46,120
good at finding successes for ping bugs

239
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,589
like that's just rooted in reality

240
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:49,990
they're looking for someone who is

241
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:52,420
holistically talented in security and so

242
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:54,339
understanding how you buy yourself as an

243
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,959
employee of a company could be

244
00:08:54,339 --> 00:09:01,650
responsible for testing and internal

245
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:01,650
product and head is critically important

246
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:06,190
while you're doing this I want to just

247
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:07,420
emphasize something really important

248
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:08,920
really quick because though a lot of

249
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:10,930
folks especially early on in their

250
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,130
budding careers fall into this trap is

251
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:13,839
that it's easy to find

252
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:16,870
you'll also find this on the methodology

253
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:19,360
pages about scanners there's lots of

254
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:22,600
lots of scares out there that provide a

255
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:27,220
lot of theoretical or informational bugs

256
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:28,660
that in reality are not bugs or at all

257
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:30,580
because they're just scanners and

258
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:33,610
there's dum and they're just running off

259
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,140
of a signature or instead like the bug

260
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:37,240
is real from the scanners perspective

261
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,920
it's just that the product has mitigated

262
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:41,500
that risk in some way that's not

263
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,089
apparent to the scanner they don't know

264
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:45,310
what else is going on they just see this

265
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:46,930
one flaw that by the signature it looks

266
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:48,729
like this is an issue but there's

267
00:09:46,930 --> 00:09:52,000
actually another way to resolve that

268
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:55,270
than directly addressing the issue as

269
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,250
the scanner suggests fixing it so if you

270
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:58,000
find yourself doing bug bounty and

271
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,110
you're trying to learn you're actually

272
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,520
trying to make a career out of this this

273
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:02,080
is actually good advice bug buddy

274
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,189
general but if you actually want to make

275
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,660
a career on this and you find yourself

276
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,190
using scanners here finding these

277
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:09,699
informational bugs and you're thinking

278
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:11,860
about reporting it stop and think for a

279
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,810
second like if your job was to was to

280
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:15,340
manage this product and you have a

281
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:17,619
multi-million dollar your security

282
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,820
budget which hey most of the products

283
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:22,180
that you would be testing the bug bounty

284
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:26,560
do I can assure you that they have run

285
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:27,609
the scanner themselves sorry sorry not

286
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,170
sorry

287
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:35,230
and so really for you to learn how to be

288
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:37,030
an effective not not a pen tester not a

289
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:41,260
bug bounty hunter but a security

290
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:42,790
engineer it's about taking the scanning

291
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:45,220
results in doing something with them and

292
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:47,620
recognizing that your value in the bug

293
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:49,000
Gani interaction is not in repeating

294
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,260
what they already know it's in finding

295
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,550
new things that's why they crowdsource

296
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:53,890
that's why they do things I'd been

297
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:55,870
testing they're looking for some form or

298
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:57,280
breadth not someone to tell them what

299
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,750
they've already found and I assure you

300
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,670
they have already read the scanner

301
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,620
themselves and that they have made

302
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:04,209
either a qualified decision to not fix

303
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,320
it for a valid reason or they fix it in

304
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:07,290
a way that's not parent to the scanner

305
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,140
like I said before

306
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:13,230
another way to understand I'm calibrate

307
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:15,720
yourself to bugs so you can understand

308
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:18,750
what's impactful and focus on useful

309
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:21,300
impactful severe bugs so that you can

310
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:22,950
grow yourself as a technical expert his

311
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:24,300
is actually look at the out of scope

312
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:25,650
bugs and bug bounty programs they're

313
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,349
actually there's a wealth of information

314
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:30,569
in there that information super valuable

315
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:33,180
because you have a but you can suddenly

316
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:34,770
kind of see into the minds of the

317
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:37,680
security engineer who wrote that on the

318
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:40,170
other side and said like you know like

319
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,790
we don't care about these sorts of

320
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:44,579
cookie attacks we don't care about these

321
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:47,430
sorts of CS or like CSRF on logout like

322
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:49,790
these are valid security issues but in

323
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:53,270
practice was the actual impact user

324
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:55,140
really nothing and like the effort

325
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:58,199
potentially to fix some of these things

326
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:59,580
is so extraordinary that other

327
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,810
mitigations can deal with the worst of

328
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,040
it and then the rest of its just like

329
00:12:00,810 --> 00:12:05,359
you'd have to just move on because

330
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:07,589
you've got an entire product to protect

331
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,790
not just the things that bug bite people

332
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:15,840
see you're also just hurting yourself

333
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:17,670
like it might seem like there's a

334
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:18,990
there's a saying in English throwing

335
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:22,140
spaghetti at the wall like spaghetti

336
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:24,150
sticks sometimes to a wall like it might

337
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,260
seem like hey you know I'm gonna get

338
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,880
paid I'm learning I'm finding all these

339
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:27,810
bugs like a nursery store spaghetti wall

340
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,790
and submit a whole bunch of stuff but

341
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,380
the issue is is that you're really

342
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,550
wasting your own time because the point

343
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,439
of bug guy is a phenomenal opportunity

344
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:38,120
for you to grow and challenge yourself

345
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:41,760
this is where you have a chance to find

346
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:45,300
actual security bugs and submit them to

347
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:47,640
a company in San Francisco and actually

348
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,530
get their attention take that

349
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,670
opportunity your own reputations at

350
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:55,140
stake because they remember trust mode

351
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:56,459
so like in practice what you do if

352
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,170
you're really starting out from zero

353
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:00,390
there's some really great sand boxes you

354
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:01,589
can use to start playing around and

355
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,510
actually finding security bugs and

356
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:05,640
looking at source code these are a few

357
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:07,200
examples google has a nice one and

358
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:08,580
there's like the dam vulnerable apps

359
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,460
there's a few different ones these are

360
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:13,980
just the highlights of two of them

361
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:16,650
excuse me sorry I landed it like eight

362
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:19,800
o'clock this morning from San Francisco

363
00:13:16,650 --> 00:13:21,209
I'm a little alright alright cool so

364
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,420
what we talked about so far

365
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:25,530
so far we've talked about the fact that

366
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,670
bug Valley is a great place for you to

367
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:30,750
be able to just start doing testing on

368
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:32,760
your own and that you need to have some

369
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,440
form of methodology that so that you're

370
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,510
being consistent and you're providing

371
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,040
coverage to yourself coverage of the

372
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:39,510
product so you can potentially find bugs

373
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,800
that others have not found before

374
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,150
because like a lot of bug bounty hunters

375
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,920
are just finding the next rounds like

376
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:46,680
scripting bug which does make them money

377
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:48,630
don't don't get me wrong but it's not

378
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,709
how you get a job doing that because you

379
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:53,100
needed to do more than just that you

380
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:57,630
need to challenge yourself to find many

381
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:59,970
different classes of bugs so now what

382
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:02,310
well now you start going on the bug

383
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:03,930
guiding platforms okay

384
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:07,020
does hacker one bug crowd Cenac you've

385
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:08,370
all heard of them probably my general

386
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:11,189
advice for someone who genuinely is

387
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:14,940
chart wants to take this and build a CV

388
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:16,260
so they can get a job one you have to

389
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,730
make this sustainable for you this is a

390
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,900
long term project this is not gonna

391
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,670
happen overnight it's not gonna happen

392
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:22,319
in three months this is a long term

393
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,180
effort just for some perspective I

394
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,890
worked at the NSA for a decade and it

395
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:29,790
took me three years to get a job in San

396
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:34,020
Francisco like it's hard like it's super

397
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:37,530
competitive that's just reality right so

398
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:40,170
this is this is a life project right

399
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:41,490
like I finally a job in San Francisco

400
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,740
was one of the monumental events of my

401
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:45,000
life I hope that if there's something

402
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:46,260
your goal that you get to achieve that

403
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,790
as well because there's tons of

404
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,290
opportunity and there's tons of folks

405
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:51,540
from India and all over the world

406
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,770
getting brought in their talents because

407
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,630
frankly there's not enough talent in the

408
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:56,069
United States to fill all these job

409
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,570
wrecks it's just insane like they're

410
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:00,000
inflating buildings at this point

411
00:14:57,570 --> 00:15:01,200
there's just filling them up so you have

412
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,880
to make it stay Taizo mansions because

413
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,990
you have to make it sustainable so while

414
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,870
there's a lot of bug bounty programs

415
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:08,190
that do not pay that maybe it's easier

416
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,930
to find bugs and that's a good place to

417
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:12,180
start especially early on I'll get to

418
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:13,170
that in a second it's really important

419
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,760
for you make this sustainable for

420
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:16,380
yourself financially so focus on

421
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,640
programs that pay money another

422
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,930
important part of that is that the

423
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,760
programs that pay money generally have a

424
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,709
larger scope and more programs because

425
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,790
these are more mature programs and so

426
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:25,410
there's a lot more opportunity and

427
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:29,490
there's a lot more tax surface for you

428
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:31,110
to find stuff those programs are also

429
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:32,460
typically a little bit more responsive

430
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:34,350
and are paying attention more and

431
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,119
actually are much more likely actually

432
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,919
action your books

433
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:38,389
there's an exception here government

434
00:15:36,919 --> 00:15:39,829
programs like the US government programs

435
00:15:38,389 --> 00:15:41,119
and the UK government programs are out

436
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:44,149
there the little different governments

437
00:15:41,119 --> 00:15:44,719
are like their own thing so just keep

438
00:15:44,149 --> 00:15:50,509
that in mind

439
00:15:44,719 --> 00:15:51,679
I mentioned the submitting to programs

440
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:54,589
potentially that don't give you any

441
00:15:51,679 --> 00:15:55,819
money the reality is that these the bug

442
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:59,019
bounty platforms hacker one and bugcrowd

443
00:15:55,819 --> 00:16:01,669
and just you know the full disclosure

444
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:06,109
mcc group does partner with hacker one

445
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:08,059
exclusively for part for platform the

446
00:16:06,109 --> 00:16:09,229
reality is is that to get access to some

447
00:16:08,059 --> 00:16:10,699
of the cooler programs I'll talk about

448
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:12,739
this for a second you have to build a

449
00:16:10,699 --> 00:16:14,988
reputation so sometimes that does mean

450
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:16,999
submitting bugs to maybe less mature

451
00:16:14,989 --> 00:16:18,919
programs that don't pay so that you can

452
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:20,569
find earlier easier bugs earlier on and

453
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:24,559
build yourself up to funding harder bugs

454
00:16:20,569 --> 00:16:27,348
where the surface areas been less picked

455
00:16:24,559 --> 00:16:29,289
over this is an example of franz rosen

456
00:16:27,349 --> 00:16:30,979
he was actually here last year he's

457
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:32,449
swedish and he's a really great

458
00:16:30,979 --> 00:16:33,619
researcher I highly recommend following

459
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:35,329
him on Twitter you'll learn a lot from

460
00:16:33,619 --> 00:16:38,899
him just seeing what he's talking about

461
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:40,429
I'm thinking about so I guess I'd you

462
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:41,719
have to build up some reputation you

463
00:16:40,429 --> 00:16:43,189
have to prove that you're actually

464
00:16:41,719 --> 00:16:44,509
submitting good bugs that you're a fair

465
00:16:43,189 --> 00:16:46,549
that you're a fair player that you're

466
00:16:44,509 --> 00:16:49,189
not trying to like that you can interact

467
00:16:46,549 --> 00:16:51,199
professionally with these bug body

468
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:52,309
programs and once you've reached once

469
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,199
you've done that you'll get invited to

470
00:16:52,309 --> 00:16:55,699
private programs and you also have the

471
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:59,299
opportunity to kind of start working on

472
00:16:55,699 --> 00:17:00,409
more advanced programs so here for

473
00:16:59,299 --> 00:17:03,769
example more advanced programs or

474
00:17:00,409 --> 00:17:04,909
Facebook this is the main Google VRP and

475
00:17:03,769 --> 00:17:06,888
there's other great examples there's

476
00:17:04,909 --> 00:17:10,220
Microsoft and just uber PayPal there's

477
00:17:06,888 --> 00:17:11,928
also the Android VRP the Google these

478
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:13,368
are these are very advanced programs the

479
00:17:11,929 --> 00:17:15,589
reality is that Facebook's very picked

480
00:17:13,368 --> 00:17:17,958
over like Facebook surface area is

481
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:20,240
pretty solidify it's and the volume of

482
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:21,470
submissions they do yearly reviews the

483
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,039
volume submissions are in the tens of

484
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:28,399
thousands

485
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:30,158
so these require depth but again the

486
00:17:28,398 --> 00:17:34,518
purpose of this talk is to get you a job

487
00:17:30,159 --> 00:17:35,809
not make bounties and so depth is

488
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:37,369
critical demonstrating you have the

489
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:39,649
ability to go deep and actually become

490
00:17:37,369 --> 00:17:41,509
an expert in something on your own time

491
00:17:39,649 --> 00:17:43,668
on your own merits and actually find

492
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:45,200
valid bugs that's impressive

493
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:47,419
regardless of the context that's

494
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,650
impressive that's cool and that's

495
00:17:47,419 --> 00:17:50,600
something that

496
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:53,480
hiring managers and like rigueur be

497
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:54,740
paying attention to but here's another

498
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,029
interesting thing if you start paying

499
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,279
attention to yourself while you're going

500
00:17:56,029 --> 00:18:01,130
through this process you will super

501
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:03,710
quickly realize what you do not know and

502
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:05,720
understand because especially if you pay

503
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:08,870
attention to blog posts and twitter for

504
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:11,690
some of the more experienced and very

505
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:13,820
knowledgeable researchers sometimes they

506
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:15,350
post up where I have to like block an

507
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:16,639
hour of my time and I'm gonna go read

508
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:19,158
this and really dig into it because it's

509
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,230
super complex and it's pretty esoteric

510
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:23,630
meaning it's kind of like weird niche

511
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:24,770
sort of testing but you know what some

512
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:26,480
of the most impressive bugs come out

513
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,799
that way and that is exactly what

514
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,940
companies are looking for when they're

515
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:30,559
hiring they're looking for people who

516
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,850
have can demonstrate that depth of

517
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:36,710
knowledge to be able to go farther than

518
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:38,090
maybe a pen testing coming like NCC

519
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:40,010
would after just like A to B test

520
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:42,799
somebody who actually me comic expert in

521
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:46,610
a product and do effective testing with

522
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,750
that domain knowledge in that product my

523
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:49,309
best advice because I've done this

524
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,149
myself and I've seen others do it when

525
00:18:49,309 --> 00:18:51,350
you encounter something you don't

526
00:18:50,149 --> 00:18:53,629
understand or like you feel like

527
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:55,639
SuperDuper comfortable with and by that

528
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:57,620
I mean you could explain it completely

529
00:18:55,640 --> 00:19:00,380
to somebody else verbally I think that's

530
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:02,870
a good bar to yell go over track it keep

531
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:04,909
it a spreadsheet dude understand what

532
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:09,350
you don't know and follow up on that and

533
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:12,039
target that to learn because if you

534
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:14,330
don't challenge yourself to find bugs

535
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:16,039
that you can't find new bugs that you

536
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,090
can't today you're not gonna grow and

537
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:18,770
learn you're just you're gonna make

538
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:21,408
great money doing bounties

539
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:24,470
but it's not the comprehensive depth

540
00:19:21,409 --> 00:19:27,520
that an employer in Silicon Valley is

541
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:32,110
looking for to sponsor you for a visa or

542
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:34,760
much less even look at the CV frankly

543
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:36,620
another important thing with this is as

544
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:38,510
you have submitting to bug bounty

545
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:39,620
program she'll quickly realize what

546
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,950
companies care about what they don't

547
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:44,830
care about and that differs wildly not

548
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:46,940
just by company but by product because

549
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:49,580
the reality is going back to what I've

550
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:51,080
mentioned before they have various

551
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,668
different mitigations for potential

552
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,408
security vulnerabilities that are not

553
00:19:52,669 --> 00:19:58,549
going to be obvious to an external user

554
00:19:54,409 --> 00:20:01,020
but so you almost have to in the dark

555
00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:02,760
kind of feel out the shape of the room

556
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,900
until you understand the shape of the

557
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,879
room and then you can use super

558
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:07,200
effective and when you start when you

559
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,090
understand the shape of the room and you

560
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,150
figured it out blind that's impressive

561
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:13,678
and demonstrating that ability is super

562
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:15,809
important they'll demonstrate that you

563
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,740
actually have the analytical ability to

564
00:20:15,809 --> 00:20:22,470
go deep and be able to be the only

565
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:26,450
person performing an internal pen test

566
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:26,450
for a product before it goes live

567
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:31,620
another important aspect of that is

568
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,330
understanding the impact your bugs I

569
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:37,830
mentioned about feeling out the shape of

570
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:39,960
the room that the reality is is that CBS

571
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:42,300
this is really a pretty awful way to

572
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:44,700
measure the severity and impact of a

573
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:45,750
security bug another thought because CBS

574
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,650
s is inherently flawed

575
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:52,530
it's just that context matters and CBS s

576
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:56,900
is basically just button ology with

577
00:20:52,530 --> 00:21:00,059
humans that requires some excuse me some

578
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:01,500
judgment calls and I actually have a

579
00:21:00,059 --> 00:21:03,090
client that I'm gonna be going to in

580
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:05,520
Chicago they're really large enterprise

581
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:07,169
software company that I'm helping reboot

582
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,580
their vulnerability management program

583
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:10,260
so they can build a bug bounty program

584
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:13,590
because right now they're not really

585
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:15,179
good at fixing bugs quickly and they're

586
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:17,370
and one of the first things we're doing

587
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:18,960
is just ripping out CBS s because we

588
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:20,189
actually had a test where we gave five

589
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,380
different people on the team the same

590
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:24,390
bug and told them to figure out the CBS

591
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:27,360
s score four and we got four different

592
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:29,550
responses that's just the reality of CBS

593
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,139
s so don't take that don't take that as

594
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:34,230
the mark of truth

595
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:35,790
think of the actual impact understand

596
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:38,520
the attack scenario from start to finish

597
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:40,559
like you the attacker are gonna go after

598
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:43,260
this user and in the end this is going

599
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,760
to be the outcome map that from end to

600
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:47,580
end if you can't do that you're not

601
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,110
there yet if you can't if you find

602
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,210
yourself able to do that and you click

603
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:53,459
the story's a little bit weak it

604
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:55,740
probably is because the bugs be frankly

605
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,300
that's just that's just the unfortunate

606
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:01,890
reality of a lot of bug bounties

607
00:21:57,300 --> 00:22:04,889
submissions which is okay bug Donnie but

608
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:06,360
it's not great for a security test when

609
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,340
you're trying to hire you as an employee

610
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:09,840
they want you they want to get value out

611
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:12,168
of you and they want you to be in sync

612
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,168
with them

613
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:16,949
I'll talk about this a little bit before

614
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:18,720
go deep and demonstrate true expertise

615
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:19,560
and your bug value submissions not just

616
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,610
for the sake of making more money

617
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,300
because you'll make a lot more money in

618
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:23,310
bugs on it that way

619
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:25,500
but also to challenge yourself to grow

620
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:27,600
as a security professional I use this as

621
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:30,120
an example this is the graph API X or

622
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,510
for Facebook you can go on this right

623
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,810
now

624
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:35,540
and you can learn the graph API to

625
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:40,710
directly query Facebook's

626
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:42,090
database and there's a guy his name's

627
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:45,180
Philippe who lives in Trinidad and

628
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:47,669
Tobago I'm pretty convinced that he

629
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:52,280
knows Facebook's graph API better than

630
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:58,220
90% of Facebook employees and he gets

631
00:22:52,280 --> 00:23:00,600
$27,000 bugs because of it that's real I

632
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:03,090
mean 27 grand I mean that's good money

633
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,679
anywhere that's amazing right but that's

634
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:07,379
because he demonstrated that depth of

635
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,820
expertise he spent the Phillie works on

636
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:10,380
their programs but he focuses primarily

637
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:13,590
on Facebook and I use that because it's

638
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:16,170
a good personal example for me but this

639
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:18,120
is true for many many different products

640
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:21,380
and many many companies this is just

641
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:25,110
like an easy easy to screenshot example

642
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:27,600
but you can check them out p HW d on

643
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:32,159
twitter super insightful super nice guy

644
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:33,810
like he actually wants to help everybody

645
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:36,240
in the community better and really

646
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:37,260
professional eyes bug bounty I won't

647
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,930
speak for him but I've gotten the vibe

648
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:41,970
that he's pretty happy surfing in the

649
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:43,530
Caribbean and submitting bugs instead of

650
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:46,640
trying to get a job and how'd he do an

651
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:49,620
hour commute in San Francisco but

652
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,360
otherwise he's demonstrating that depth

653
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:53,159
to be able to actually be a security

654
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,419
engineer because he he went and took the

655
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,700
time to understand the product and he

656
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:58,440
understands the impact he doesn't submit

657
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,880
bugs that sometimes these from sim it's

658
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,260
invalid bugs everybody does you know

659
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,820
there's something you don't know it's

660
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:07,110
fine but the bugs he finds her super

661
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:08,939
unique cuz he understands the product

662
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:12,560
and he's demonstrated the ability to do

663
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,560
that a lot of people in bug Donny don't

664
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:17,640
okay so you can find bugs but now here's

665
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:21,510
the harder part this is actually much

666
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:23,400
much harder can you fix them remember I

667
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:26,370
use the term I use the title security

668
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,040
engineer you're not a pen tester you're

669
00:24:26,370 --> 00:24:28,840
not

670
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,610
by yourself you're not just doing pen

671
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:33,580
tests you're not just evaluating you're

672
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:35,740
an engineer that's what now well not

673
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:37,870
exclusively a majority of companies in

674
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:40,000
Silicon Valley are looking for someone

675
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:47,020
who not only can find bugs but fix them

676
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:50,500
and that's a pretty high bar bug ballet

677
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:52,389
is inherently a reactive tests the code

678
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:56,020
the bugs already in production the puck

679
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:57,760
the bug is affecting users right now and

680
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:59,470
that's really not a great place to be

681
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:01,240
for a company like you would rather the

682
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:04,090
bug never went out to begin with you

683
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,860
rather have found it while software was

684
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:07,449
being developed or prevented it from

685
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:09,100
even being written into software that's

686
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:10,840
where these companies really want to be

687
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,070
and that's where many of them right now

688
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:14,590
and especially in the last five years

689
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:16,210
I've seen the transition and security

690
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:18,580
budgets in Silicon Valley moving towards

691
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:20,500
preventive work rather than reactive

692
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:22,230
work like more tests and things like

693
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:25,120
that

694
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:28,330
so the real goal of hiring a security

695
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:30,219
engineer is as much to help find bugs as

696
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:33,790
to help make sure they never happen to

697
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:35,700
begin with so if you are super high if

698
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:39,780
you have a super deep technical

699
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:42,490
understanding of the product and you see

700
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:45,389
the same security issue keep coming up

701
00:25:42,490 --> 00:25:48,040
over and over and over again new code

702
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:49,840
well your jobs to make sure that like is

703
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,820
to put the pieces together and say like

704
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,649
ask the question well how can we change

705
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:55,030
the way our engineers actually write

706
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:57,090
features like this so that they never

707
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:59,410
introduced the bug to begin with I

708
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:00,760
highly recommend actually googling about

709
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:04,030
how Facebook start this because they've

710
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:05,710
got quite a bit of publishing on this to

711
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:07,030
the point where internal functions that

712
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:08,920
are potentially dangerous they actually

713
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:10,149
renamed a function in the codebase so

714
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:12,850
you have to write like this is a

715
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:15,340
dangerous thing to do as the function

716
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:17,439
name and that actually helps little

717
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:18,520
things like that but again that means

718
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,370
you have to be a software engineer and I

719
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:23,200
mean you have to write code and it's not

720
00:26:21,370 --> 00:26:25,389
just about the product itself it's also

721
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,880
about doing to be able to write security

722
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:29,440
tooling for the security team so that

723
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,030
you can scale yourselves some of these

724
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,190
some companies only have like a few

725
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:34,540
folks cuz they're like brand-new

726
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:36,940
startups or something like that they

727
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:39,280
don't have all talk books so manual

728
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:40,960
effort is highly frowned upon and be

729
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,550
able to automate yourself out of the

730
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,470
rudimentary and getting yourself into

731
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:47,830
the thinking and the fixing and the

732
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:50,070
preventing is really where security

733
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:53,740
engineering talent and the valley is

734
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:55,330
also look it paid way way more if you

735
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:56,380
actually have security and actually just

736
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,639
have software engineering skills this

737
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,350
just the way the valley works is there's

738
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:02,830
a lot biased towards software engineers

739
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:08,439
and especially from an equity grant

740
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:10,210
perspective so theoretically you could

741
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,340
get a job in the in you could get a job

742
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,780
in a lot of tech companies just being a

743
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:15,220
pen tester at red team or especially

744
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:17,560
this is more true for the very very

745
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:19,210
large companies but it's true for

746
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:24,040
smaller ones as well depending upon the

747
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:26,050
product but as is a very very very very

748
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,460
hard path to getting a visa I'll just be

749
00:27:26,050 --> 00:27:30,820
honest with you because there's a lot of

750
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:32,200
talent that can only find bugs but can't

751
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:34,360
fix them there's what there's a lot more

752
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,440
than people who can do both and so

753
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:37,300
putting yourself in the pool of people

754
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,680
who can only find bugs is very

755
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,750
restrictive and really limit your

756
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,280
opportunities I think there's exceptions

757
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:45,400
of course I'm not staying this is like

758
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:46,960
the law but as a trend being on a lot of

759
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,240
interviewed loops and being a hiring

760
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,190
manager you're just making yourself way

761
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:55,030
more potentially valuable and worth the

762
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:57,130
effort to justify the visa if you're

763
00:27:55,030 --> 00:28:01,450
more than just if you're a fixer and a

764
00:27:57,130 --> 00:28:03,850
finder another aspect of this is that

765
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:05,380
the reality is like an internal security

766
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:06,790
teams actually have access to the source

767
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:08,590
code so they don't need to do black box

768
00:28:06,790 --> 00:28:10,240
testing black box testing which is black

769
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:12,310
which is what bogdani is black box is

770
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:14,260
where you are literally given a black

771
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:15,700
magical black box you have to figure out

772
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:16,660
how to break it you don't understand it

773
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,990
at all you don't know what's on the

774
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,730
inside

775
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:21,190
that's what bug bounty is and that's

776
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,450
what a lot of pen tests are but if you

777
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:23,500
have access to the source code you can

778
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:25,450
actually crack that open and actually

779
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,830
see how it works and analyze it and find

780
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:28,210
classes of bugs that you would never be

781
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:30,010
able to find in black box because you

782
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:31,570
would need infinite amount of time to

783
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:34,120
find all these different attack vectors

784
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:35,530
against the magic box versus you have

785
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,169
the source code you can look through it

786
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:41,920
and see design flaws that are very

787
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:44,110
apparent and a black box that's would

788
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,700
never find so a lot of internal security

789
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:47,260
reviews they don't call them pen test a

790
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,510
lot of times in companies a columnist an

791
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:52,210
intern a security review involves source

792
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:54,290
code and so if you can't it you don't

793
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:55,670
have to be an amazing software engineer

794
00:28:54,290 --> 00:29:00,290
but you do need to be able to find

795
00:28:55,670 --> 00:29:01,850
security flaws in source which is not

796
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:03,350
easy heads up

797
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:06,050
it's not easy there's a reason these

798
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:10,610
jobs pay a fortune if you're still

799
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:13,899
learning which frankly I am too you have

800
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:16,550
to crawl and then walk and then run

801
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:20,090
there's two aspects to the software -

802
00:29:16,550 --> 00:29:22,250
like the thing L to write code part of

803
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:23,899
this one they're security engineers the

804
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:27,590
engineering that's writing security

805
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:28,820
tools for the team itself honestly the

806
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:29,959
best place to start is to reinvent the

807
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:32,600
wheel there's a security tool that

808
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:35,450
you're using try to replicate a feature

809
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:36,679
of it for yourself from scratch you the

810
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:38,390
nice thing about that is you'll have a

811
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:40,040
reference when you get totally stuck you

812
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:41,720
have no idea how to approach that you

813
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:43,370
can kind of cheat and look and help to

814
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,260
help yourself move along independently

815
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:47,570
without having to like go ask the

816
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:49,310
internet for help all the time and then

817
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:50,600
walk means eventually if you're

818
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:52,820
especially if you have a look a really

819
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,879
solid consistent methodology which all

820
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:57,260
the top bug bounty hunters do have

821
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,120
you'll eventually find a process that's

822
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:01,760
ridiculously painful on manual and not a

823
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,469
great use of your time and then you can

824
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:05,090
automate it and you'll create new

825
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:07,520
tooling maybe it'll really set to him

826
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:09,919
maybe not you can put on a TV and talk

827
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,930
about it in an interview regardless and

828
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,980
then there's software engineering so I'm

829
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:15,620
trying to separate the two but let's

830
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:17,390
talk about the previous was about tools

831
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:19,610
writing tools that are security related

832
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:25,310
versus being able to actually write

833
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:27,500
software so for to crawl frankly look at

834
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:29,120
a non-secure related open-source project

835
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:31,340
that's relatively straightforward the

836
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,510
the damn vulnerable applications are

837
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,860
actually a great place to look at that

838
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:34,700
because those are purposely vulnerable

839
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:39,469
so you can look at the source code

840
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:41,690
especially the web apps the other part

841
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:45,560
of it is actually looking at a large

842
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:47,030
code base by yourself at an open source

843
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:48,710
project and actually being able to add a

844
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:50,899
feature understanding how to add

845
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:52,850
features and large code large code bases

846
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:55,040
it's completely different than when you

847
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:56,300
write your own little web app like very

848
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,100
large code bases are a complete

849
00:30:56,300 --> 00:31:00,379
different ballgame from an engineering

850
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,969
perspective on what you're actually used

851
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:04,910
to being able to write new features in a

852
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:06,500
large code base engage with a project

853
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:08,000
this is just by the way this is one way

854
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:10,040
of doing it this is Mike my easy

855
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:13,070
generic recommendation you don't have to

856
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:15,170
like live by it by any means but what

857
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:17,600
can I recommend to an entire room of

858
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:19,460
people that I don't know in India this

859
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,620
is probably the most safest in generic

860
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:23,570
way but I'm sure you could find others

861
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:26,360
that hippies say I have the same

862
00:31:23,570 --> 00:31:29,000
marriage for sure engage with an

863
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,830
open-source project and I think it's a

864
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,690
great place start just like sign up look

865
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:34,730
in the backlog and sign up to fix it to

866
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:36,740
like Peter fix a bug or add a feature

867
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:39,080
it's a place to start you're getting

868
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:40,340
near now not just learning how to write

869
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,960
code in large code base we're actually

870
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,939
committing code with other people

871
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:47,810
committing code simultaneously which is

872
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:49,310
a skill to itself like being able to

873
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:51,440
merge code is actually a whole thing

874
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:57,190
there's these are people's jobs it's

875
00:31:51,440 --> 00:32:00,920
just to deal with release management see

876
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:02,420
and how do you run you crush it and you

877
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:04,160
let people see it the nice thing is with

878
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,840
open source projects and say it's easy

879
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,800
to put on your CV if you have it you

880
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,240
might have a job and software

881
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,560
engineering but you can talk about that

882
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,870
in generic terms but you know what open

883
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:14,090
source projects you can just give them

884
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:17,090
your give your github and they'll look

885
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:18,139
for themselves and that's real I'll be

886
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:19,550
honest with you being in being an

887
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:21,920
interview lives people who provided like

888
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:23,360
really solid like github profiles those

889
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,920
went straight to the top because that's

890
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:26,870
real we could evaluate their whole code

891
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:28,670
quality remotely in the real world on

892
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:30,409
the spot without even an interview I

893
00:32:28,670 --> 00:32:31,070
have an idea of who we wanted to talk to

894
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:34,700
who we didn't

895
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:36,830
super powerful these are two examples

896
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:39,260
that are kind of security related so to

897
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:41,540
kind of stay to the bug bounty angle so

898
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:43,340
one is that Google has the patch rewards

899
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:45,440
program and so Google has a bunch of

900
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:47,389
open-source products if you find a bug

901
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:49,730
in a Google open source product they'll

902
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:51,260
happily like take your submission in bug

903
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:53,270
bounty and they'll pay you out for it if

904
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:55,280
it's valid of course but they'll pay you

905
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:57,020
extra money if you actually submit the

906
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:58,700
fix for it to so you actually can get

907
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:01,220
paid for writing code for Google for

908
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:03,350
fixing the bug that you found and that's

909
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:05,210
super legit and that's like a crazy good

910
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:07,580
resume a CV bullet sorry our home

911
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:10,850
resumes in America another one is the EU

912
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:13,220
actually just awarded a contract and is

913
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:15,320
launching bug bounties for various

914
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:17,510
open-source pieces of software and you

915
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:19,340
can google for fossa - bug bounties and

916
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:21,530
you'll find the list there's a bunch of

917
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:22,850
stuff in there these are

918
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:25,700
it's chalant what's really good about

919
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:27,080
these is that they're very challenging

920
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:30,050
because but they're also well-known

921
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:33,649
products that need a lot of love like

922
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:35,060
SSL's in there and but I forget some of

923
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:38,930
them how there's also time my head right

924
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:40,250
now but these are while advanced this is

925
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:41,470
something to challenge yourself with if

926
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,760
you really want to challenge yourself

927
00:33:41,470 --> 00:33:44,930
and you want to understand the

928
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,580
boundaries of your own technical

929
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:48,170
knowledge from a security perspective

930
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:50,330
and a software engineering perspective

931
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:52,490
these are great ways to do it because

932
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:54,770
you want because if you're engaging with

933
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:56,150
that you're genuinely trying see two

934
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:57,410
things will happen one you understand

935
00:33:56,150 --> 00:34:00,230
your boundaries and what confuses you

936
00:33:57,410 --> 00:34:01,820
and two you'll see what people who are

937
00:34:00,230 --> 00:34:04,190
successful are doing and the way they

938
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,540
talk and you'll be it basically make it

939
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:08,918
to have the experience of being around

940
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:11,029
like a high quality engineering team

941
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:12,350
without having to work in one of those

942
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:14,360
companies and that exposure and

943
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:18,830
experience is invaluable for you to be

944
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:20,840
able to be effective yourself most

945
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:24,889
importantly a Volvo is you need to round

946
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:28,070
yourself out write the details of your

947
00:34:24,889 --> 00:34:29,960
bugs in detail and publish them really

948
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:31,490
walk through it not just know their

949
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:32,899
steps like I found this cool bug here's

950
00:34:31,489 --> 00:34:35,509
what it does but actually walk through

951
00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:38,779
and explain to people how you got there

952
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:40,790
tell them a story the purpose of this is

953
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:42,560
not necessarily to broadcast to the

954
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:44,090
world that's fine but it's actually to

955
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,610
challenge yourself to see if you're

956
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:49,100
effective in telling a story because

957
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:51,320
most of the time if you're a security

958
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,429
engineer for a software company

959
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,590
you're spend most your time talking

960
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:56,389
software engineers and explaining story

961
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:58,640
is unlike why these bugs are bad and why

962
00:34:56,389 --> 00:35:00,290
they should fix them because you

963
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:01,640
software engineering teams like they

964
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:04,070
might have growth numbers to hit they

965
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:06,080
have you know the wall street expects

966
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:07,910
certain daily active youth monthly

967
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,830
active user numbers they expect that and

968
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:12,230
these engineering teams are building new

969
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:14,240
features around those numbers and the

970
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:16,640
last thing they want to deal with is a

971
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,490
security bug especially if it's not

972
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,080
especially if it's like a super low

973
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:22,700
priority like yes technically we should

974
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:25,880
mix this but the impact is like this

975
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:28,850
effects like 0.5% of users in really

976
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:31,310
esoteric situations so yes you're right

977
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:33,940
we should fix it but we can wait six

978
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:33,940
months and it's okay

979
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:39,109
the other good so the on telling story

980
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:40,220
is really important the other part is

981
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:41,990
that she demonstrate that you're

982
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:44,569
actually able to help others train

983
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:46,459
people get on stage mentor people one on

984
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:47,690
one do both of those things because

985
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,220
they're different skill sets being able

986
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:51,410
to actually mentor someone one-on-one is

987
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:53,259
a completely different skill set to be

988
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:55,430
able to get on a stage like this and

989
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:57,920
ideally you can do both because the

990
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:59,118
reality is is that at least the security

991
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:05,230
engineers of Facebook were expected to

992
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:07,610
be able people this is probably the most

993
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:09,610
important one I think and I think in the

994
00:36:07,610 --> 00:36:11,690
context of bug Donnie must be said

995
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:16,010
because there's a lot of horror stories

996
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:17,180
for researchers gone wild and the bug

997
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:19,250
counting space that's really unfortunate

998
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:23,600
because it undermines the credibility of

999
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:25,160
the entirety of Hotspurs testing we're a

1000
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,770
security conference in India we're on a

1001
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,879
beach and Goa it's great it's beautiful

1002
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:30,830
in front of a bunch of hacker types

1003
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,080
there's gonna be a party tonight it's

1004
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:36,340
awesome right and so it's easy to think

1005
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:39,140
that our entire industry is like this

1006
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:41,150
which is can't be true don't get me

1007
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:43,160
wrong it is like that if you've ever

1008
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:47,180
been to DEFCON it's absolutely like that

1009
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:48,890
for a week but just to give you some

1010
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:55,580
quick perspective I this is a slide from

1011
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:57,650
a deck I give to executives to help my

1012
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,880
clients to get new budget for bug bounty

1013
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:01,310
programs over the finish line to help

1014
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,869
them understand this is what they're

1015
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:04,070
thinking about you're thinking about

1016
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:06,380
money you're thinking about getting a

1017
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:08,420
job the people on the receiving on these

1018
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:10,369
bugs the people per person you're trying

1019
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:11,930
to be this is what they're thinking

1020
00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:14,240
about how they're thinking about lawyers

1021
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:15,529
and everything about like PR people and

1022
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,700
they're thinking about service level

1023
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:18,530
agreements and they're thinking about

1024
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:20,480
merging bugs and thinking about how the

1025
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:23,420
hell we're gonna pay people without like

1026
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:26,420
the IRS coming after us or like oh man

1027
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:28,820
like this person lives in like Syria

1028
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:31,640
like can I send them money you know

1029
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:33,859
these are real things you know like like

1030
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,970
like super super hard real things like I

1031
00:37:33,859 --> 00:37:37,490
don't want to go to jail sending money

1032
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:39,439
to like Iran if I if that turns out to

1033
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:40,669
be illegal I don't know like these are

1034
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:41,869
what these companies are thinking about

1035
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,980
that's what the individuals are thinking

1036
00:37:41,869 --> 00:37:44,450
about you need to understand that

1037
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:45,950
because you gonna be on the other side

1038
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:47,330
of that you actually you're successful

1039
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:48,680
here

1040
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:52,100
I mean look at this this is just the

1041
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:57,440
legal stuff this is crazy like this is

1042
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:58,940
somebody's job I'll leave it up there

1043
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:03,040
for a magnet so you can just like absorb

1044
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:06,470
the horror of what legal systems done

1045
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:09,009
but it's real it's really and the so

1046
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:12,140
it's easy to think that you're in this

1047
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:15,320
but this is actually what you're dealing

1048
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:17,060
with and I think that mental as much as

1049
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:19,250
like I'm here on shorts and we're

1050
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:20,330
totally cool you know most of the

1051
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,740
meetings I has a technical program

1052
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:23,029
measure Facebook where with people who

1053
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,439
looked exactly like this and those

1054
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:27,020
conference rooms looks exactly like that

1055
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:31,700
like I was the one I was like the one

1056
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:33,050
guy in shorts you know like but because

1057
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:34,700
I could be the guy in shorts because I

1058
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:37,970
was technically confident and I had like

1059
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:40,310
that respect to be the technical nerdy

1060
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:42,049
guy wearing shorts to a meeting

1061
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:43,220
literally with like armor one meeting

1062
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:44,510
there is literally we had to get a

1063
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:47,560
bigger conference room we had the 12

1064
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:49,730
person table of nothing but lawyers and

1065
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:52,009
there is me and they're all dressed like

1066
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:55,820
that even a Facebook and there's mom me

1067
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:57,230
like this right but so it's easy to like

1068
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:59,300
think we're in this chill space but this

1069
00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:01,520
is this people's livelihoods these are

1070
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:03,860
these companies brands on the line and

1071
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:06,440
they take it super super seriously and

1072
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:11,120
you need to respect that in order to

1073
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:12,650
play the game so yeah even if you're not

1074
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:14,750
working yet maybe you're still doing bug

1075
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:16,780
bounty from your house if you're making

1076
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:19,400
solid money doing it treat it like a job

1077
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:20,960
follow the rules and music a

1078
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,820
professionally listen to your audience

1079
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,360
and learn from them empathize with them

1080
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:28,700
build mutual trust and build

1081
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:30,290
relationships locally in your security

1082
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:32,060
community and globally across the

1083
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:34,190
community like me like I started out hit

1084
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,570
me up on LinkedIn please how do you do

1085
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:36,800
that

1086
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:39,290
because the reality is when you submit

1087
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,880
that CV you know who's gonna be like

1088
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:42,140
your network and your mentors and your

1089
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:44,150
interviewers and your hiring managers

1090
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:47,350
those people you are submitting bugs to

1091
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:50,750
and I assure you they will remember

1092
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:52,370
right because here's what happens this

1093
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:55,010
is a famous one you can google just uber

1094
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:57,140
taxi driver or hacker one taxi driver

1095
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:59,210
this is a famous one

1096
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:01,069
this particular researcher was

1097
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:04,820
displeased with having there

1098
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:06,110
reputation scorn hiker one reduced for

1099
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:08,420
them submitting a bug that they admitted

1100
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:09,680
from the beginning was out of scope like

1101
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,910
they wrote in their words report a scope

1102
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:14,990
we had notice out of scope I want to

1103
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:16,910
like submit anyway and when they put

1104
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:21,410
over closed it saying it was out of

1105
00:40:16,910 --> 00:40:29,930
scope just as a report said got a little

1106
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:32,450
perturbed this is my favorite when I

1107
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:34,009
when I knew new hires this is like slide

1108
00:40:32,450 --> 00:40:35,750
the really welcome to bug bounty your

1109
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:37,250
triaging let's just get the hard parts I

1110
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:40,880
the way first people here swear at you

1111
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:42,050
you know it's real and finally I'm gonna

1112
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,450
give you a moment of honesty because

1113
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:45,950
this is a big thing globally the

1114
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:49,490
unfortunate reality is that the language

1115
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:52,790
of this Korean industries English I have

1116
00:40:49,490 --> 00:40:55,160
encountered folks that while at a base

1117
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:57,890
while verbal communication skills are

1118
00:40:55,160 --> 00:41:00,500
super important if you can just master

1119
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:02,870
the written English language well you're

1120
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:05,180
at a great start I've had meetings with

1121
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:07,060
engineers and many household name

1122
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:10,759
companies who I could not understand

1123
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:13,340
across the conference room table but I

1124
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:15,920
never realized that they struggled

1125
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:17,620
speaking English verbally because their

1126
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,850
emails and messages were so well written

1127
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:21,350
right they had it like their accent was

1128
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:22,880
rough they didn't learn they were never

1129
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:24,860
surrounded by native English speakers

1130
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,810
when they're learning how to speak but

1131
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:29,480
they understood English really well so

1132
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:31,040
it's really really important so ideally

1133
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,020
we'd all talk like this guy cuz man he

1134
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,990
great public speaker he can communicate

1135
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:37,759
professionally he can empathize he can

1136
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:39,470
tell a story I can actually get in the

1137
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:41,780
date and a great details without making

1138
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:44,000
people feel stupid it's really important

1139
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:46,130
you're not there to judge is carry

1140
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,950
professional as much as we like to were

1141
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:51,170
there to help you can even talk like her

1142
00:41:48,950 --> 00:41:54,140
and be like super formal and like really

1143
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:56,270
a pi/8 really like to the point and be

1144
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:58,310
above everybody you gave me talk of this

1145
00:41:56,270 --> 00:41:59,570
by be super goofy but you know what when

1146
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:00,830
he started talking about animals and

1147
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:02,360
like their behavior he got super

1148
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:04,700
technical and super serious and people

1149
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:06,260
stopped and listened even though he was

1150
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:08,899
super kooky about it while I did it was

1151
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:10,730
super fun and great TV I'll tell you one

1152
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:12,920
thing you shouldn't do never talk like

1153
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:15,470
this guy

1154
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,010
okay there's no situation where that's

1155
00:42:15,470 --> 00:42:18,549
okay

1156
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:21,080
this video does let's be real okay

1157
00:42:18,550 --> 00:42:22,090
because here's what happens here's what

1158
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:25,640
happens

1159
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:27,170
remember that report before that person

1160
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,970
was banned from Orr's program and then

1161
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:33,830
hacker one decided to jump on in and

1162
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:35,089
like just pile on and here we are this

1163
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:36,560
person's name out there and we're

1164
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:43,720
talking about it right here and removes

1165
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:46,640
like 100 people that's reality so

1166
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:48,799
wrapping up Raj checklist for success

1167
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:52,759
this is super simple to the point I mean

1168
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:54,470
it's a little fun but just be able to

1169
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,480
fail to find multiple kinds of bugs

1170
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:58,939
don't just be a web app person don't

1171
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:00,500
just be a mobile person you need to

1172
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:02,390
diversify yourself because if a

1173
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:03,680
periphery is hiring you full-time

1174
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,850
they're gonna wanna throw a bunch of

1175
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,230
different stuff at you they want they

1176
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:08,480
want somebody they can just throw

1177
00:43:06,230 --> 00:43:10,370
problems at and solutions come out just

1178
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,630
like any company right any job they want

1179
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:13,520
to throw they want throw problems at you

1180
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,720
and magic comes out so you need to arm

1181
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,060
yourself and prove that you're able to

1182
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,189
do that understand the impact of these

1183
00:43:17,060 --> 00:43:20,750
bugs don't just take CBS s scores don't

1184
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:22,670
just take scanner outputs don't just

1185
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:25,730
take the theory of the bug apply it to

1186
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:27,440
the real world and end from the

1187
00:43:25,730 --> 00:43:29,570
origination of the attack scenario to

1188
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,460
the very end impact where like the bad

1189
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:33,470
thing happens and be realistic to

1190
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:35,120
yourself about how practical this is and

1191
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:37,810
what's the likelihood given all the

1192
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:41,620
other bugs that an app company has on

1193
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:43,430
their plate that they have to fix

1194
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:47,810
whether it's actually worth their time

1195
00:43:43,430 --> 00:43:50,930
to fit be able to actually help fix or

1196
00:43:47,810 --> 00:43:52,430
prevent bugs with access to source code

1197
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:56,089
by being able to read source code be

1198
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:57,919
able to communicate in code to software

1199
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:59,930
engineers who sometimes have zero

1200
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:02,480
insight to security and that's not

1201
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:03,680
they're not necessarily like they should

1202
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,120
understand security enough but it's not

1203
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:07,190
their job to be security experts there

1204
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:10,100
it's their job to build features and

1205
00:44:07,190 --> 00:44:11,240
make money your job is to be there to

1206
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:14,120
help them and get them there as much as

1207
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,810
possible I'd be able to in order to do

1208
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,049
that yet be able to communicate

1209
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:17,049
effectively

1210
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:24,890
so it's easy to say like oh yeah if you

1211
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:26,089
follow this this pattern you'll get a

1212
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:26,700
job in Silicon Valley I think that's

1213
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:27,750
true I think

1214
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:29,040
reasonably if you do all these things so

1215
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:31,050
this is like amazing like we're talking

1216
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:33,329
about creating super human right like

1217
00:44:31,050 --> 00:44:35,010
this is like the be-all end-all every

1218
00:44:33,329 --> 00:44:37,380
most people are wind up somewhere in

1219
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:40,230
between like nothing and what I just

1220
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:41,430
described and above a certain bar in

1221
00:44:40,230 --> 00:44:43,650
certain situations that's perfectly fine

1222
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:45,390
but maybe being a Silicon Valley's not

1223
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:47,040
your goal honestly like I'm thinking of

1224
00:44:45,390 --> 00:44:48,660
moving out like in working remotely

1225
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,300
because it's like crazy expensive and I

1226
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:52,560
can't even like afford to like go out to

1227
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,359
a movie because I can't afford childcare

1228
00:44:52,560 --> 00:45:00,750
this is like 30 bucks an hour where I

1229
00:44:54,359 --> 00:45:02,940
live it's crazy yeah right so the the

1230
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:04,950
reality is is that like you can actually

1231
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,630
do what I was talking about many places

1232
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:06,960
in the world and if you set that bar for

1233
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:09,589
yourself

1234
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,460
you'll go anywhere you can go anywhere

1235
00:45:09,589 --> 00:45:13,770
Silicon Valley just like the hardest

1236
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:16,380
hardest one but if you even try this you

1237
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:20,550
can go anywhere and just so you know

1238
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:22,500
this presentation was partly written and

1239
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:25,740
inspired by a good friend of mine

1240
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:27,990
Reginaldo de Silva who famously was one

1241
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:29,790
found at the time the most impactful

1242
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:31,740
most highly paid out Facebook bug ever

1243
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:33,329
and they offered him a job but you know

1244
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:35,490
he was an engineering manager in Brazil

1245
00:45:33,329 --> 00:45:36,810
software engineering manager for an

1246
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:39,089
accounting company or something like

1247
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:40,380
that I forget and he just didn't side

1248
00:45:39,089 --> 00:45:42,540
for extra money because they don't pay

1249
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:43,829
well on Brazil so security wasn't even

1250
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:47,700
his thing he just did it for the money

1251
00:45:43,829 --> 00:45:49,140
initially simplifying a bit so here's a

1252
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:51,689
quote from him the guy who went from

1253
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:53,460
Brazil he had a job did black guy on the

1254
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:57,079
side for cash and got a job offer at

1255
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:57,079
Facebook and got the highest payout ever

1256
00:45:57,319 --> 00:46:00,810
by the way the first version his

1257
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:02,369
presentation was done in Brazil so

1258
00:46:00,810 --> 00:46:07,770
that's why he's quoting to Brazil but

1259
00:46:02,369 --> 00:46:08,190
it's applicable for India as well that's

1260
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:10,319
all I got

1261
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:12,960
thank you so much for your time I really

1262
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:17,270
appreciate it now I've looked a lot of

1263
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,270
time for questions hit me

1264
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:19,549
you
