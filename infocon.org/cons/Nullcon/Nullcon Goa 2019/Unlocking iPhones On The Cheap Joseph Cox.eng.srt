1
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:08,620
hello okay cool

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:10,030
can you hear me yes as mentioned I'm

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,700
Joseph Cox I'm going to be talking about

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:14,678
unlocking iPhones on the cheap or more

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:16,570
precisely unlocking iCloud locked

6
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:20,410
iPhones on the cheap so if you came here

7
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:24,910
to see some BIOS O'Day's get dropped you

8
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:27,970
can leave now don't don't leave but more

9
00:00:24,910 --> 00:00:30,280
specifically this is about when people

10
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:32,980
steal iPhones they can't just use them

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:37,600
because of a various features I'll go

12
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:39,910
into the phone cannot be factored reset

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,829
until someone has the iCloud password so

14
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:43,089
if you robbed someone you probably don't

15
00:00:41,829 --> 00:00:45,390
have that password cuz they're probably

16
00:00:43,089 --> 00:00:49,089
a random person there's this entire

17
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:51,969
ecosystem supply chain underground

18
00:00:49,089 --> 00:00:53,979
industry that facilitates the unlocking

19
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:56,260
of these phones but then at least in the

20
00:00:53,979 --> 00:00:58,690
United States it has a very weird

21
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:01,210
intersection with the right to repair

22
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:02,949
industry which are these people who go

23
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,870
and they they're third-party repairers

24
00:01:02,949 --> 00:01:06,370
or third-party sellers and they need to

25
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:08,829
either remove iCloud so they can sell

26
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:10,119
the phone or maybe they have a customer

27
00:01:08,829 --> 00:01:11,939
and they want to repair it something

28
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:14,380
like that so there's this very

29
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:18,479
uncomfortable alliance between the

30
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:22,149
criminals and then this more legitimate

31
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,250
industry so as mentioned I'm from

32
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:25,930
motherboard which is the technology and

33
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:29,380
science section of ice

34
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:31,810
I'm not a cybersecurity researcher in

35
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:35,229
that traditional sense but our beats

36
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:37,229
sort of cross over I cover the digital

37
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:41,380
Underground the surveillance industry

38
00:01:37,229 --> 00:01:42,759
and increasingly stuff like Facebook and

39
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,960
platforms and that sort of thing but

40
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:48,909
obviously here I'm talking more about

41
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:50,589
some hacking side so this is all based

42
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:53,259
on a piece that me my editor-in-chief

43
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:54,939
did what we've been working on since

44
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:57,520
November they just came out this month

45
00:01:54,939 --> 00:02:00,279
Jason Kevlar how hackers and scammers

46
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,380
break into iCloud locked phones I handle

47
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:07,840
the hacking part he handles the sort of

48
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:11,109
right to repair bit as well so this is

49
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,940
on a very high level the process of from

50
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:14,709
going from stealing a phone right up to

51
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,239
unlocking it and selling it

52
00:02:14,709 --> 00:02:18,579
I'm going to go through each of these

53
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,980
step-by-step but just so you kind of see

54
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:23,260
that we are making progression because

55
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,780
it is kind of a complex supply chain

56
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:30,790
first of all obviously you need to

57
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:31,870
physically steal a phone and as I

58
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,760
mentioned it's not as simple as just

59
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:36,790
going up and taking someone's iPhone and

60
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,519
then being able to resell it in the

61
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:41,858
United States at this university the

62
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,260
police warns that recently robbers have

63
00:02:41,859 --> 00:02:48,190
been mugging people at gunpoint and

64
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:50,920
saying remove iCloud right now or delete

65
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:52,329
your iCloud prone the phone and when you

66
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,720
have a gun to your face you're probably

67
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:59,290
going to try to cooperate with the with

68
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:02,290
the robbers and then a case from well a

69
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:04,179
couple of years ago now a woman was

70
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:07,000
leaving a metro station in Washington DC

71
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:08,950
a man grabbed her from behind put her in

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,129
a chokehold and then told her remove

73
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:13,238
iCloud now she was unable to because

74
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:17,018
obviously she's been physically

75
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:18,430
restrained by this fief he gets a phone

76
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:19,900
and then runs off and he's caught and

77
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:21,760
whatever and he can't get into the

78
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:25,629
device because he didn't get the UM he

79
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,629
didn't get the password so why are

80
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:32,620
thieves even doing this well it's

81
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:34,659
because in iOS 6 or iOS 7 someone is

82
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:37,299
going to correct me on that but we're

83
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:38,948
talking a pretty long time ago now maybe

84
00:03:37,299 --> 00:03:41,500
even before lots of people even bought

85
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:43,690
iPhones Apple introduced something

86
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:47,260
called activation lock which is that

87
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:50,739
when you report your phone as lost or

88
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:52,840
stolen not only does it come up with

89
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:54,909
that little marker on the device but it

90
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,859
kicks in activation lock and now this

91
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:58,810
means when you go to factory reset the

92
00:03:56,859 --> 00:04:00,669
device you know when you'll go through

93
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,699
the process and they will eventually get

94
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:04,750
it will start booting up and it will say

95
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:07,000
sorry this is linked to an iCloud

96
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:09,370
account please enter the Apple ID and

97
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:12,129
password to continue to actually be able

98
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:14,560
to do that right to reset at all again

99
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:16,659
if you're a thief you probably don't

100
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,099
have time to go hey sorry I'm robbing

101
00:04:16,659 --> 00:04:19,510
you but can I also have your Apple ID

102
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:21,190
and password please I mean I'm in a bit

103
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:25,750
of a rush here and I'm trying to get

104
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:28,180
your $700 phone so clearly

105
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:30,460
this is a really good measure from Apple

106
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:32,950
I'm sure that the number of stolen

107
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:36,130
iPhone devices has decreased it's a

108
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:37,450
really robust mechanism but that doesn't

109
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,980
mean it stops all threats it doesn't

110
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:42,460
mean it stops all attackers it doesn't

111
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:44,800
stop all thieves clearly instead some

112
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:47,020
thieves are going to adapt their

113
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:52,180
strategy and in this case it's demanding

114
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:54,479
them to remove or delete iCloud and you

115
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:57,010
will see like like with a guy who

116
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,510
chokehold the woman and then took the

117
00:04:57,010 --> 00:05:01,450
phone and didn't have the password you

118
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:03,700
you see these phones crop up on eBay or

119
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:06,099
Facebook and various other place as well

120
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,659
you know Craigslist or whatever if you

121
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:10,540
just buy a dodgy phone maybe there's a

122
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:13,000
chance they'll be iCloud locks and then

123
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,960
you see them all on a eBay and you can

124
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:18,850
just type in Apple iPhone four parts and

125
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,440
again some of the people will be selling

126
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:22,240
it just so you can take out the camera

127
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:25,000
or the screen and then someone else can

128
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,760
use that but what's clear is that four

129
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,760
parts is also something of a euphemism

130
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:32,020
in some cases for hey I stole this phone

131
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:33,640
you know I can't get into it I'm now

132
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:35,590
going to sell it obviously you don't

133
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:39,370
write that on eBay so you put four parts

134
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:41,320
instead but clearly people who are

135
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:43,600
selling these devices know that there is

136
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,400
a way and an industry to unlock them

137
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,930
because that bit I've highlighted at the

138
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:53,770
bottom it says um I don't know the

139
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:56,440
iCloud account iCloud locked I don't

140
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,870
want to pay extra to unlock the iCloud

141
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,610
so yeah this person has a problem and

142
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,560
they can't be bothered to do the next

143
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:06,460
step but they are alluding to that there

144
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:08,350
is this industry here and yeah this is

145
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:09,820
where the sort of the Digital

146
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:12,040
Underground comes in where the hacking

147
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:14,260
or the cyber security element I guess it

148
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:17,350
moves from a physical crime war into a

149
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:19,510
cyber enabled crime as law enforcement

150
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:22,630
would probably describe it so you have

151
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:24,159
this phone you don't really know what to

152
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:26,020
do with it yet apart from that you want

153
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,419
to remove the iCloud you need to get

154
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:30,490
more information about it so you're

155
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:34,120
going to use one of these variety of

156
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:36,080
lookup tools to get a bit more data and

157
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,539
details about the phone

158
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:40,128
and Sona and as you can see I mean the

159
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:41,419
next step is going to be the fishing so

160
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:43,789
this will play into that and it will

161
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:46,250
also play into another technique which

162
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:49,969
isn't listed on there yet but we will we

163
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:51,590
will get that see get the phone and then

164
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:56,180
maybe you'll go to one of these services

165
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:58,188
such as f3 iCloud dog coat UK apparently

166
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:00,409
run by two students from London at least

167
00:06:58,189 --> 00:07:02,300
that's what they say on the website they

168
00:07:00,409 --> 00:07:04,009
haven't responded to my emails so if

169
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,430
you're listening get back to me that'd

170
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:07,280
be great

171
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:09,740
and all you do is you punch in the IMEI

172
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:13,099
which is that unique code on the bottom

173
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,780
on the back of the iPhone you know

174
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:17,330
unique identifier for every mobile

175
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,219
device you do that you put that in and

176
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:21,919
near instantaneously

177
00:07:19,219 --> 00:07:23,960
you'll get whoever find my iPhone is

178
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,180
enabled which as you all know is the

179
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,159
feature to be able to login to a desktop

180
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,779
or a laptop and see I've lost my phone

181
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:31,789
oh it's now in Queens New York or

182
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:33,529
actually I left it in that bar in San

183
00:07:31,789 --> 00:07:35,330
Francisco or something you can see

184
00:07:33,529 --> 00:07:38,479
whether the iCloud status is clean or

185
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,529
not whether it was a replaced device but

186
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:43,310
then you get to like much more

187
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:45,800
interesting stuff for for a hacker or a

188
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:48,590
Fisher stuff like the carrier so in this

189
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,960
case it was armed sprint in the

190
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:53,270
purchased country and very crucially the

191
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,310
estimated purchase date and it'll be

192
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:59,870
clear why that is um a lot more

193
00:07:55,310 --> 00:08:01,610
important later we tested this with one

194
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:04,159
of our own phones obviously I'm not

195
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:06,199
going to show you the serial number that

196
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:07,490
is one of our editors phones we just

197
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:11,860
want to see if the service works and it

198
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:14,509
does return correct and valid

199
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,770
information as you can see I mean the

200
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:17,330
one on the left has a lot more than one

201
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:18,889
on the right has less because you then

202
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,740
start have to you have to pay I don't

203
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:23,509
know a dollar for some reports 50 cents

204
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,830
for others and to be honest I'm a

205
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:26,690
cheapskate so I didn't want to bother

206
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:30,789
paying these criminals to look up this

207
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:33,320
phone but we verified it works and then

208
00:08:30,789 --> 00:08:35,659
this is going to be a constant theme

209
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,479
throughout this industry is that there's

210
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:40,968
automation and lowering the barrier of

211
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,459
entry for hackers and for criminals you

212
00:08:40,969 --> 00:08:45,529
have to remember we're dealing with an

213
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:48,439
industry that caters to common thieves

214
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:49,939
people who steal phones we're not

215
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,310
talking about a

216
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,810
et 29 we're talking about someone who

217
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:56,449
stole the phone outside a tube station

218
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:58,670
so clearly the technical capability is

219
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:00,800
going to be somewhat lower than the vast

220
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:03,140
majority of adversaries with that in

221
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,060
mind you can go on to telegram

222
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:08,000
you know the messaging platform that has

223
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:10,880
a box feature you'll come to this bot

224
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,410
and you'll give it an IMEI number and

225
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,260
you will say hey what do you want to

226
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:16,819
know do you want to know whether it was

227
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:18,620
with the iCloud lockers enabled

228
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,900
activation lock sorry with a Phi my

229
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,610
phone is enabled anything like that and

230
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:26,390
as you can see it will just return that

231
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:27,830
information as well and that just

232
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:30,490
streamlines the whole process it just

233
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:32,510
makes it so much easier not only for

234
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:35,150
someone who's not the most technically

235
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:37,490
minded but also someone who may be in a

236
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:43,760
rush or maybe has dozens if not hundreds

237
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:46,790
of phones to process at once these

238
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,470
lookup tools it can be hard to see where

239
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:50,449
exactly they gain the data from because

240
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:52,250
of course their back-end is not exactly

241
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,420
transparent and they don't really want

242
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,550
to answer questions about it

243
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,530
from what I understand with

244
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,859
conversations with people familiar with

245
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,660
it

246
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:02,690
is that these are more likely carrier

247
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:04,339
lookups as in some sort system from AT&T

248
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:08,090
or Verizon just as a hypothetical

249
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:10,730
example but there are criminals who are

250
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:12,590
using internal Apple systems breaking

251
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:15,200
into them and then using them to get

252
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:17,450
information about the phone as well so

253
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,730
um I guess just before I carry on these

254
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,920
screenshots where they're all than this

255
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:23,330
sort of format with the blackboard

256
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:26,089
active the user names and that sort of

257
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:29,540
thing this is from a chat room I sat in

258
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:31,580
for I don't know a month and a half two

259
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:33,740
months and something like that and then

260
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:36,290
it's just hackers who are telling each

261
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,940
other oh this is how you unlock a device

262
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:40,160
from India this is how you unlock a

263
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:44,000
device from the UK there's anyone going

264
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,709
the advice for XYZ so at the top

265
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,520
apologies the screen the text a little

266
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:48,980
bit smaller actually

267
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:51,620
but someone say hey I'm having issue

268
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:53,089
with this and someone suggests try

269
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:55,460
checking GSX

270
00:10:53,089 --> 00:10:58,850
so you can then find the last carrier

271
00:10:55,460 --> 00:11:01,220
that was on this phone gsx is apple's

272
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:02,220
global systems exchange I really hope I

273
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:05,250
got that acronym

274
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:08,880
correct and this is a sort of internal

275
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:10,170
database that tracks Apple devices have

276
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,939
been flagged for repair so if you go

277
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:15,479
into a genius store you give them a

278
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:18,510
phone your device is going to be added

279
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,930
to gsx and then a Genius Bar operative

280
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:23,640
can then look it up and then see oh it

281
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:25,969
was lasting for this or it was in for a

282
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:28,560
screen repair or something like that but

283
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:30,360
information in that can also be helpful

284
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:34,530
to these Fisher's who may want the time

285
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:37,200
of his purchase for example and they are

286
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:39,780
actively exploiting gsx I mean this is

287
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,610
certainly not new it's just um y means

288
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:43,140
been going for literally at least five

289
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,510
years which is it's not really reported

290
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:47,340
that much here is someone's selling a

291
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:50,280
list of emails that they believe are

292
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:52,620
linked to gsx accounts so it's not here

293
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,329
are seven gsx accounts it's here are

294
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,030
seven emails that we know have an

295
00:11:54,330 --> 00:12:00,060
account you then do with them what you

296
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:01,890
want and you know I have no legal you

297
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,540
know culpability for what you do after

298
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:05,699
that which is of course trying to fish

299
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:09,360
them and trying to get access to the gsx

300
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:13,290
account itself this is um this is the

301
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,270
post from a third party Apple repair

302
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:17,610
person I think just on an Apple forum

303
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:19,829
and they're complaining that it seems a

304
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:21,510
database of gsx users has been

305
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:23,970
compromised and verified that this is

306
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:25,910
just that claim because them and others

307
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,840
are getting a flood of phishing emails

308
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:30,270
asking for their GSX

309
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,560
credentials so clearly someone is pretty

310
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:36,360
damn interested in getting into these

311
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:38,339
accounts and even though I can't say the

312
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,160
only reason people are breaking into gsx

313
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:43,500
is to do this iCloud unlocking certainly

314
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,420
a portion of those people are doing that

315
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:48,120
and we did also see people just straight

316
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:51,479
up selling gsx accounts on Twitter and

317
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:56,610
via email and various other places as

318
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:59,190
well and this is this is the information

319
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:01,800
you can get from gsx I mean you can

320
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:03,540
already see it's a lot more details than

321
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,890
the stuff I showed you earlier those

322
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:06,750
from the carrier albeit it's different

323
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:09,480
information and it's not all going to be

324
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:12,120
relevant but this is the telegram bar I

325
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:15,580
was mentioning and there's one dollar 10

326
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,930
cents for a full gsx report it takes

327
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,310
not to five hours there are other

328
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:20,260
reports to take three to five days

329
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:21,609
perhaps because they need to go in

330
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,920
person to the Apple store we're not

331
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:26,620
actually sure about that bit but then

332
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:28,479
you look on the right and there's all of

333
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,610
this sort of sensitive information the

334
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,210
MAC address at the Wi-Fi the date of the

335
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:37,960
first activation serial number and

336
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:39,520
various other things but again these

337
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,990
guys aren't trying to repair iPhones but

338
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,540
some of that information may actually be

339
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:46,240
useful to them when they go on to the

340
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:49,150
the next stage which is of course

341
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,490
phishing the victims iCloud details

342
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:54,459
again we have the phone we've stolen it

343
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:56,620
we're now looking up devices information

344
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:59,560
about the device and now we're getting a

345
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,180
better idea of who to target to steal

346
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,579
this iCloud password and I guess I

347
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:07,209
should say that it's not always clear if

348
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:08,560
it's the same person who stole the phone

349
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:10,420
outside the tube station is the same

350
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,859
person doing the hacking if anything it

351
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,150
appears they're different people it

352
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,950
seems that someone will steal the phone

353
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,810
maybe they'll give it to the hacker mate

354
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:18,640
or they'll sell it on eBay as an iCloud

355
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:20,920
lock device and then the hacker then

356
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:25,120
takes over in the supply chain of them

357
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:26,920
going into this phone so when you're

358
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,510
fishing for clouds the first thing you

359
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,860
want to do that's a really dumb joke I'm

360
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:32,350
sorry but the first thing you want to do

361
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:34,660
is that you check the stolen iPhone

362
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:36,790
screen for more information because

363
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:38,620
obviously if your phone's been stolen

364
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:42,430
you can push a message to the screen

365
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:45,430
saying hey I left my phone in the bar if

366
00:14:42,430 --> 00:14:47,170
you find it please call this number in

367
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:49,089
the hope that somebody's gonna pick it

368
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:51,819
up and then send it to you so you get

369
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:54,640
that and from that you're probably going

370
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:56,560
to get a good idea of where the victim

371
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,699
is located I mean simply just based on

372
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,709
the phone number right it's gonna have a

373
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:02,770
New York area code or it's gonna have a

374
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:06,010
certain country code whatever it may be

375
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:09,240
and I mean I mean guess thinking about

376
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:12,970
that in this hacker chat room I saw

377
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:16,090
devices from everywhere saw devices from

378
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:19,680
India from New York elsewhere in the

379
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:19,680
states United Kingdom

380
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:28,510
is it the Jets again Jesus and then

381
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:31,600
Philippines Southeast Asia everywhere

382
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:34,329
and the attackers themselves also seem

383
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,310
to be based globally we just see some of

384
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:38,500
the Philippines as well Eastern Europe

385
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:41,469
and this is just based on details that

386
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:43,600
they were exposing in the chat room as

387
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:46,390
well as the time zone so that they were

388
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,089
posting in and that sort thing where you

389
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:52,089
have the device and you figured out

390
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:53,680
where this person probably is and then

391
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:56,440
you want to pick a tool from your iCloud

392
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:58,329
fishing kit which will go into shortly

393
00:15:56,440 --> 00:16:00,430
and it's probably going to be SMS

394
00:15:58,329 --> 00:16:02,500
because as I said you look at the phone

395
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:05,979
and the person's phone number that is a

396
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:08,050
way to get into their account you could

397
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:10,990
also send an email and as I'll show you

398
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:14,459
shortly the cat the the fishing kits

399
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:17,740
also sometimes include fake maps so oh

400
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:20,109
your iPhone was found in New York you

401
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:21,970
then place a convincing looking map that

402
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:24,010
will obviously entice the target to

403
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,420
click the map it will then go to a

404
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:28,569
phishing page and they'll enter their

405
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:30,339
details I mean this is not new but the

406
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,990
point I'm trying to make is that while

407
00:16:30,339 --> 00:16:34,779
you may have a fishing kit that is

408
00:16:31,990 --> 00:16:36,850
geared for banking or one that's geared

409
00:16:34,779 --> 00:16:40,420
for Facebook you also have ones that are

410
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:43,649
very custom leet a tailored for iCloud

411
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:48,430
fishing as well and then you fish their

412
00:16:43,649 --> 00:16:49,540
credentials obviously and just to give

413
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:53,589
you an idea of like what this actually

414
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:56,680
looks like in the hacker chatroom every

415
00:16:53,589 --> 00:16:57,970
I mean at least every hour the activity

416
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,290
in there is pretty constant because

417
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:01,180
these attackers are spread all over the

418
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:03,310
world people are constantly sharing

419
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:05,409
images of devices that they've either

420
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:07,659
stolen or have got into their hands and

421
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:09,669
a lot of them are asking hey what

422
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,980
country is this from seemingly they

423
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:12,910
can't Google the country code again

424
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:16,390
these aren't the world's most

425
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:18,280
sophisticated hackers but then just to

426
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:20,799
give you an idea there is a constant

427
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,359
stream of these all coming in and some

428
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:26,470
of them are clearly stolen I mean that

429
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:28,899
one sort of middle autumn we saw you

430
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:29,679
stole our things come back or we'll call

431
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,840
the police

432
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:34,970
the other one is the lost iPhone

433
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:36,379
to the right as well and his PC I mean

434
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,460
they're just they're just absolutely all

435
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:40,220
over the place and you do occasionally

436
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:43,300
see like an Apple watch in there as well

437
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:49,940
but it was mostly iPhones and then um

438
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:51,800
iPads as well and I'm trying to move

439
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,970
this up from we start in Digital

440
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,320
Underground and then eventually we'll

441
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:57,680
get to the surface of the right of

442
00:17:54,320 --> 00:18:00,500
repair sort of in between these guys

443
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:02,840
aren't exactly hiding you go on Twitter

444
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:05,510
and you just type in iCloud unlock or

445
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:07,040
Apple kit which is one of the popular

446
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:08,480
fishing kits you're gonna get tweets

447
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,700
like this which is just straight up

448
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,650
offering the surface like a DME and I'll

449
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,890
unlock your iPhone unlock your iCloud

450
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:18,680
for you also on Facebook also on

451
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:19,910
Instagram all over the place and there

452
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,160
are dozens and dozens of accounts

453
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:24,310
offering this because typically what the

454
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:26,540
fishers will do is they'll have a kit

455
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:28,909
you buy access to it for a hundred and

456
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,740
fifty bucks and then they encourage you

457
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:32,060
to promote it almost like is a reseller

458
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:34,370
program so they always have their own

459
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:38,050
affiliate program for generating more

460
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:41,919
interest in their fishing kits and then

461
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:44,629
this is Mustafa Rothman who's obviously

462
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,460
he's there he's selling Apple kit which

463
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:48,560
is the the fishing kit I'm going to

464
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,120
focus on in a minute and you could just

465
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,960
see how brazen they are just tweeting

466
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:57,199
flat-out hey yeah you can come by this

467
00:18:52,960 --> 00:19:00,590
he's he's seemingly based in Egypt based

468
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:03,590
on a whatsapp phone number that he left

469
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:07,820
exposed in a video tutorial of his

470
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:09,260
explaining how the kit worked so yeah it

471
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:12,710
just it just shows how global these

472
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:14,810
people are as for the fishing kits

473
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:17,180
themselves again it's all streamlined

474
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:19,250
it's all lower barrier of entry it's for

475
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:21,800
very common criminals fear to break into

476
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:23,690
and there's even an app that will just

477
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:26,990
do the process for you so this is um

478
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:29,990
this is the app version of Pro Kit I

479
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:32,120
believe and you can see that obviously

480
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:33,770
this is a native app and you just have

481
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:36,139
all of you different options there which

482
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:37,820
we'll go into in a second but it's just

483
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:40,469
trying to make the process as painless

484
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:43,570
as possible

485
00:19:40,469 --> 00:19:46,659
this is what Apple kit looks like before

486
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:48,218
you log in I mean it varies from fishing

487
00:19:46,659 --> 00:19:50,109
kit to fishing kit but sometimes you

488
00:19:48,219 --> 00:19:52,059
host it on your own infrastructure you

489
00:19:50,109 --> 00:19:55,839
just spin up a server and then well this

490
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:57,549
here or if you buy from the add the

491
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:58,389
administrator of the efficient kit maybe

492
00:19:57,549 --> 00:20:00,279
they also provide their own

493
00:19:58,389 --> 00:20:02,458
infrastructure as well which again just

494
00:20:00,279 --> 00:20:06,070
makes it even easier for these people

495
00:20:02,459 --> 00:20:08,440
thanks - I'll try to get the handle

496
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:11,249
right at Dave underscore Dave's for

497
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:13,509
providing some of these screenshots

498
00:20:11,249 --> 00:20:15,789
legally as a journalist I can't go and

499
00:20:13,509 --> 00:20:16,779
log into fishing panels even if there

500
00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:18,609
are criminal because if that's an

501
00:20:16,779 --> 00:20:22,029
authorized access I don't fancy getting

502
00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:24,668
indicted so I don't log into them even

503
00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:26,259
if there are passwords available but

504
00:20:24,669 --> 00:20:27,820
this independent security researcher

505
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:29,799
decided to and then provided the

506
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:33,099
screenshots here so we can actually see

507
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:37,779
inside the campaigns for getting into

508
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:40,029
these are Kyle's account so you log in

509
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:42,579
and there's just all of these different

510
00:20:40,029 --> 00:20:46,409
options you may want to pick from to get

511
00:20:42,579 --> 00:20:49,178
into the lis accounts so first of all is

512
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:50,379
probably the most obvious approach which

513
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:53,139
is going to be that you're going to text

514
00:20:50,379 --> 00:20:56,019
that phone number which is displayed on

515
00:20:53,139 --> 00:20:57,789
the device and they can make it look as

516
00:20:56,019 --> 00:21:00,009
if it's coming from Apple at the top of

517
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:01,749
the top of the text message or just say

518
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:04,209
from Apple or if they do a phone call it

519
00:21:01,749 --> 00:21:06,099
will then spoof from there as well they

520
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:09,039
can decide to send it from different

521
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:10,779
countries so of course if the victim is

522
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,019
from the UK you probably want to get a

523
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:18,219
+44 number to pretend the person is

524
00:21:14,019 --> 00:21:20,409
phishing from there as well this is the

525
00:21:18,219 --> 00:21:21,999
phone lookup services so rather than

526
00:21:20,409 --> 00:21:24,339
just going and doing the lookup I

527
00:21:21,999 --> 00:21:26,379
mentioned earlier you can also in the

528
00:21:24,339 --> 00:21:27,999
fishing kit itself get that information

529
00:21:26,379 --> 00:21:29,738
as well so you don't even need to really

530
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:31,179
go anywhere you just get the fishing kit

531
00:21:29,739 --> 00:21:33,029
you log in and you can do everything you

532
00:21:31,179 --> 00:21:35,829
may possibly need to do right there

533
00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:37,269
while you're logged in and again that's

534
00:21:35,829 --> 00:21:39,639
probably not the gsx stuff that's

535
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:42,219
probably more the carrier ends as well

536
00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:44,498
and then you have a selection of

537
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:46,299
pre-configured links obviously depending

538
00:21:44,499 --> 00:21:50,289
on how you want to fish your target as

539
00:21:46,299 --> 00:21:53,289
the iCloud one the Apple ID fmi which is

540
00:21:50,289 --> 00:21:54,200
Find My iPhone itunes giftcard maybe you

541
00:21:53,289 --> 00:21:57,650
want to say

542
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:59,600
oh hey you've won 20 bucks on iTunes

543
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:01,400
click here to login I mean that sounds

544
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,290
quite stupid on the face of it but it

545
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:07,370
can be quite enticing to a target

546
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:09,050
obviously and then just normal phishing

547
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:10,969
email templates so some people have

548
00:22:09,050 --> 00:22:12,260
templates for hey I need one for the

549
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:13,940
Philippines and obviously they need to

550
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:15,620
get the localized language and you want

551
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,059
for the UK which is going to need to

552
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,780
have the correct grammar and all of that

553
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:20,570
sort of thing

554
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:22,760
so rather than rewriting your own

555
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:25,520
phishing emails every time you're not

556
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,500
just buying access to the capability to

557
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,120
send emails on mass you're buying access

558
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:32,510
essentially to knowledge and be able to

559
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,219
fast track that as well and then just a

560
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:36,379
dedicated link shortener you know kind

561
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,100
of like bitly but it may be I'm just

562
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,340
making this up

563
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:41,840
I see lol why or something that could

564
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:43,459
potentially convince someone it's an

565
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,919
iCloud account or something like that

566
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:47,480
and they change each time because

567
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:50,780
they'll have these shorts and links and

568
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:52,490
then the TLDR the the TLD will remove it

569
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:55,280
or whatever and they constantly have to

570
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:59,630
churn through and get new accounts as

571
00:22:55,280 --> 00:23:02,690
well so you log in and this is actually

572
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:06,320
what Mustafa Othman the administrator of

573
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:09,050
Apple kit sees because he rather

574
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,120
foolishly or rather or daesh ously left

575
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:14,000
a hard-coded password in all of the

576
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,889
Apple kits copies so if you know where

577
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,540
to look you can get that password and

578
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:20,179
you can just log into any instance of

579
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:22,460
Apple kit you happen to find online I

580
00:23:20,179 --> 00:23:25,070
don't know if that's because he fancies

581
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:26,690
spying on his customers and what they're

582
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,520
up to or maybe stealing their iCloud

583
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:29,900
unlocks or whether he's an idiot I don't

584
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,300
know which one it is it could be both

585
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:34,429
but you log it in and then you can see

586
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,320
absolutely everything here and on the

587
00:23:34,429 --> 00:23:38,330
Left there's you know the various

588
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,300
different email services you might want

589
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:43,909
to use and then on the right this is the

590
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:47,149
map the map feature I was talking about

591
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:48,260
so you select the victim the email the

592
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:51,260
time obviously and then right at the

593
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,730
bottom slightly cropped off is Oh your

594
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:54,500
address has been found at Wall Street in

595
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:59,700
New York please click the map and then

596
00:23:54,500 --> 00:24:02,100
we'll find you your phone and just

597
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:03,330
that a lot of these hackers are doing

598
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:05,240
this on their mobile I mentioned that

599
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:07,889
this is just now the mobile browsing

600
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,830
version and that's just one victim and

601
00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:12,510
one device but there are people doing

602
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:15,689
this a somewhat scale I mean we're

603
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:18,600
probably talking dozens per attacker not

604
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:19,649
really hundreds so as you can see here

605
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:22,740
right at the top

606
00:24:19,649 --> 00:24:26,250
this person has ten victims 38 devices

607
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:28,139
36 of them are iOS I've obviously

608
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:32,039
redacted the names and the email

609
00:24:28,139 --> 00:24:33,779
addresses of the the victims but all of

610
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:35,760
them except one have been completed so

611
00:24:33,779 --> 00:24:38,429
this is being successful even though it

612
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,139
may be a Dharma itunes giftcard fish it

613
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:42,029
may be like a text message saying it's

614
00:24:40,139 --> 00:24:44,549
we're from the police and we found your

615
00:24:42,029 --> 00:24:47,490
phone please login it clearly does work

616
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:49,408
and I feel like sometimes information

617
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:51,269
security we are too obsessed with the

618
00:24:49,409 --> 00:24:54,090
top-end sexy

619
00:24:51,269 --> 00:24:55,740
I also day exploit chains where hey this

620
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:59,699
is a security issue that's impacting

621
00:24:55,740 --> 00:25:01,200
real people all over the world so and

622
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:04,049
just an example of some of the phishing

623
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,340
pages this is probably the most standard

624
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:07,710
one yd1

625
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,269
obviously if you send them a text

626
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,950
message they click on the text in their

627
00:25:09,269 --> 00:25:13,590
phone it's going to obviously open on

628
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:18,210
the mobile phone right depending on the

629
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:21,330
browser it may show more or less of the

630
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:22,860
actual domain so potentially if you can

631
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:27,570
manage to make a domain that's I don't

632
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:29,639
know Apple ID - Apple dot password dots

633
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:31,590
really dodgy domain com

634
00:25:29,639 --> 00:25:33,330
if you can make it so the browser

635
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:34,830
doesn't show the really dodgy domain

636
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:39,600
comm bit you're probably going to have

637
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:41,639
some some success here this is a text

638
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:43,260
message one actually for the Delhi

639
00:25:41,639 --> 00:25:46,289
police and someone saying they're from

640
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:48,419
Apple care your device was handed in to

641
00:25:46,289 --> 00:25:50,129
the police please click here and I mean

642
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:54,210
you can see what I mean with the Apple

643
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:55,980
ID - at all com I mean that's not a bad

644
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:57,630
that's not a bad fishing to me and

645
00:25:55,980 --> 00:26:00,120
obviously there's something after it as

646
00:25:57,630 --> 00:26:02,880
well but in that blacked-out piece

647
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:05,250
there's also the IMEI number of the

648
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,230
targeted device so obviously the

649
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:09,600
attacker can just see that then they can

650
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:10,860
keep track of which I me I belongs to

651
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:14,699
which target and

652
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:17,299
something this is the itunes giftcard

653
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:21,870
one again you know pretty convincing but

654
00:26:17,299 --> 00:26:24,570
it's not just text messages or your

655
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:26,428
emails there is sometimes also phoning

656
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:28,559
up victims as well so this person is

657
00:26:26,429 --> 00:26:33,420
claiming that they have a call center

658
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:35,730
for Spanish that will phone up and try

659
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:37,350
to convince people that hey you know we

660
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:40,170
found your phone we need to get your

661
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:41,699
credentials now only Spanish at the

662
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:43,380
moment but apparently they'll move into

663
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,630
English as well so these guys will just

664
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,590
do whatever they can and they and I'm

665
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:48,660
not sure if you really get the full

666
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:51,030
context there again it's quite small but

667
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:52,890
this the point of this was that oh the

668
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:55,530
email didn't work there texting work now

669
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:57,750
let's try ringing them because if these

670
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,190
guys have a lock phone they they really

671
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:00,570
do need to get in there to make any sort

672
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:02,820
of profit especially if they even bought

673
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:06,870
the lock phone as well they have to be

674
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:08,428
able to resell it and then there's the

675
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:10,260
example of a terrible fish as you can

676
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:11,490
see the the iPhone is the wrong

677
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:14,340
capitalization the ex the wrong

678
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:16,020
capitalization but again apparently this

679
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:17,600
is what is successful according to the

680
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,830
hackers in this chatroom

681
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,449
right so yeah we've gone through

682
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:23,159
physically stealing the phone or getting

683
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:24,990
hold of one that's been stolen losing

684
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:27,450
their lookup tools then you fish the

685
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:29,940
iCloud victims accounts you remove

686
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:31,950
iCloud from the from the device and

687
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:35,429
you're well on your way actually making

688
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:38,250
a profit and the hack is in this chat

689
00:27:35,429 --> 00:27:41,100
room don't shut up about how successful

690
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:43,320
they are whenever they do unlock a phone

691
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,418
the administrator encourages them to

692
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,879
post a screenshot saying Oh unlock

693
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:49,919
success blah blah blah and then they

694
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,970
also encourage them to tweet about it so

695
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,440
they can obviously then get more

696
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:54,720
publicity for their fishing case and how

697
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,900
effective is and they also have a real

698
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,000
habit of sharing these Apple memes or

699
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,429
telegram stickers in the hacker chat

700
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:05,580
obviously Steve Jobs thumbs up good job

701
00:28:02,429 --> 00:28:06,150
and locking their iCloud and then an

702
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,100
apple

703
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:09,120
okay sorry but seriously just sitting

704
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,280
there for months and just looking at all

705
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:14,100
these and Ed Sheeran memes as well for

706
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,870
some reason in any way so you've done

707
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:17,790
that now you're gonna resell on the

708
00:28:15,870 --> 00:28:20,040
black market and I don't know if you

709
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:21,480
bought a phone for 100 bucks maybe you

710
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:23,500
can then give it to a shop you think and

711
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:25,900
then resell it for at least 500

712
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:29,710
not above depending obviously on the

713
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:32,640
phone and stuff but bonus it's not just

714
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:36,000
fishing there is also the way that

715
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:39,640
scammers will trick apple into unlocking

716
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,970
the devices as well with fake receipts

717
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,140
so put the fishing aside that's totally

718
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:48,280
done this is almost an entirely

719
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:50,170
different mechanism now hackers in this

720
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:53,889
chatroom and then the related one also

721
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:57,940
sell receipt templates for t-mobile

722
00:28:53,890 --> 00:29:00,130
Verizon AT&T you know it basically says

723
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:01,270
though that they're sort of a skeleton

724
00:29:00,130 --> 00:29:04,450
you can just put all the sorts of

725
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:06,730
details in the dates the phone the IMEI

726
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:08,830
number that you'll have and crucially

727
00:29:06,730 --> 00:29:10,390
that sort of information that we got

728
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,710
from the lookup services such as that

729
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:13,150
date of purchase that's why it's so

730
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:15,700
important because you can then feed it

731
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:18,960
into this fake receipt receipt and trick

732
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:21,790
Apple and I mean they're not cheap it's

733
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,380
$150 per invoice or if you buy two one

734
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:25,960
hundred twenty-five dollars each so it's

735
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:29,950
an investment on these um occurs part

736
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:32,470
and interestingly Lee is not just

737
00:29:29,950 --> 00:29:33,970
carriers it's also Apple store receipts

738
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:36,640
so they will get the Apple store down

739
00:29:33,970 --> 00:29:40,630
play and then use that to trick Apple as

740
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:42,340
well and then I mean clearly they're

741
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:43,860
just gonna have a use Photoshop or some

742
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:46,720
sort of other image manipulation

743
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:49,629
software to then enter in all the

744
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,430
details but the reason they do this is

745
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:54,000
because if you go into an Apple Store

746
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:57,070
and you have a phone that's locked and

747
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:59,380
you have this supporting documentation

748
00:29:57,070 --> 00:30:02,470
you've just fabricated there is a chance

749
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:04,150
that you can convince someone that the

750
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,350
Apple Store to remove iCloud from the

751
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:08,350
device of course they have the technical

752
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:10,689
capability to do this so this is an

753
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:12,219
internal Apple document we obtained or a

754
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:13,840
reconstruction of one we wouldn't

755
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:15,420
publish the original but all the

756
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,600
language is the same

757
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:21,880
and it's it's just about an app that

758
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:24,610
Apple employees have inside the store

759
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:27,550
and if you look at the bottom it says

760
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:29,979
request unlock managers only so you go

761
00:30:27,550 --> 00:30:32,080
in you take the invoice you may speak to

762
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:34,179
a normal Genius staff member at first

763
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,530
and then maybe they'll bring over their

764
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:40,190
manager and you can convince them

765
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:44,420
hey I forgot the password to this phone

766
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:46,970
please let me in this this is probably

767
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:49,520
not gonna work for stolen iPhones

768
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:52,070
especially if it's been stolen and then

769
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:54,860
the owner has marked it as lost or

770
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:56,540
stolen or something like that because if

771
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:57,530
you would imagine the processes are

772
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:58,639
going to be somewhat different and

773
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:01,430
that's probably going to raise alarm

774
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:05,120
bells if someone comes in with a latent

775
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:07,880
least stolen phone but you don't even

776
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,800
have to go into an Apple store as

777
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:11,750
mentioned these guys are all over the

778
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:13,389
world these scammers and hackers so you

779
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:16,220
may even have a guy in the Philippines

780
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:19,840
who can just remotely chat with Apple

781
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:22,850
over customer support email or whatever

782
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,520
send them the fake invoice send them the

783
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:26,840
IMEI and the other information and

784
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:29,450
according to this email that was shared

785
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:32,659
in the hacker chatroom in French the

786
00:31:29,450 --> 00:31:34,970
TLDR is that hey thank you for that

787
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:36,410
information we have now we believe you

788
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:38,960
and we've now removed iCloud's

789
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:40,430
activation lock from that device and

790
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:41,630
then they're free to do whatever they

791
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:48,160
want with that phone use it themselves

792
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:52,660
or sell it on or anything double bonus

793
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:54,470
so there is another way that hackers I

794
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:57,740
don't know where you would call these

795
00:31:54,470 --> 00:32:00,860
guys like repair scammers I guess but

796
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:03,800
beyond the phishing beyond using the

797
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:07,030
fake receipts there is this technique

798
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:09,740
which is primarily used in China where

799
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:12,440
these scammers allegedly physically

800
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:14,690
manipulate the hardware to give a stolen

801
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:17,020
iPhone in a clean IMEI number which

802
00:32:14,690 --> 00:32:19,910
sounds like an incredibly laborious

803
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:23,210
stressful and technically difficult

804
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:25,490
process we're still reporting on this

805
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:27,980
and we probably will do a piece on it in

806
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:29,750
the near future but our sources in the

807
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,250
repair community who work with iPhones

808
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:33,170
every day and take them apart and put

809
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:35,390
them back together they said yeah sure

810
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:36,710
it's possible yes it happens but dear

811
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:38,900
God they would not do it because that

812
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:40,400
sounds like a real pain but someone's

813
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,800
doing it and as you can see obviously by

814
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:46,240
the universal devil face emoji

815
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:48,590
whereas restarting in phishing it is one

816
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,970
tricking Apple is six this is obviously

817
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:51,860
devil emoji times

818
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:53,690
million because that's pretty damn

819
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:56,300
impressive to be able to physically

820
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:58,130
change Mei number on the stolen phone

821
00:32:56,300 --> 00:33:00,620
again I don't have many more details

822
00:32:58,130 --> 00:33:01,550
about that if you do feel free to um

823
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:06,290
signal me because we're definitely

824
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:09,379
interested in covering them so that's

825
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:11,300
kind of all of the the criminal bit the

826
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:13,070
Digital Underground part and then this

827
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:15,560
is where it kind of bubbles up beyond

828
00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:20,330
social media and actually crosses over

829
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:22,159
into legitimate industry so in the

830
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:24,889
United States and elsewhere but we just

831
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:27,250
focus on the u.s. is that there is a

832
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:29,960
community of people who repair iPhones

833
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:33,290
we sell them legally

834
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:35,930
this isn't criminal stuff and maybe they

835
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:37,850
will buy a load of phones from a carrier

836
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:39,560
auction you know t-mobile has a load of

837
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:41,570
phones or on a shelf in a store or

838
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,669
something and they can't resell them as

839
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:44,899
news they have to just well we'll put

840
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:47,180
them in auction and then someone will

841
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:50,240
buy I don't know 20 or 50 phones their

842
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:52,040
time it turns out according to a

843
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,570
refurbisher that we spoke to who we

844
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,970
granted a minuite to speak candidly

845
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:58,510
about the process is that some of these

846
00:33:55,970 --> 00:34:03,050
carriers do sell a load of iCloud locks

847
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:05,240
devices so maybe a customer of t-mobile

848
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:06,950
had a phone they used it for a bit six

849
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:08,540
months a year or something they hand it

850
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:10,670
back into the store but they haven't

851
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:11,840
logged out of iCloud and now t-mobile is

852
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:15,080
screwed because they can't really do

853
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,640
anything about that but they'll sell the

854
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,350
phones regardless because t-mobile just

855
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,400
want to get rid of them maybe somebody

856
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:21,589
will buy them and then take out the

857
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:24,050
camera or the screen again but some

858
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:26,060
people are buying them it seems to then

859
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:33,470
unlock them and then sell them at a

860
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:35,659
profit and I mean you can see why it

861
00:34:33,469 --> 00:34:38,419
would be tempting even though to be

862
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:41,179
clear any method for unlocking your

863
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:43,370
iCloud unless you know you're the actual

864
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:46,129
legitimate owner is I ever going to be

865
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:48,799
highly fraudulent as in trying to scam

866
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:51,050
or a fake receipt or straight-up illegal

867
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:53,780
when you're hacking someone so even

868
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:55,820
though it's fraudulent or potentially

869
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:57,350
illegal these these people on the right

870
00:34:55,820 --> 00:35:00,920
to repair will still interact with this

871
00:34:57,350 --> 00:35:03,680
community so let's say a a repair person

872
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:05,960
buys an iCloud lock phone for 220 bucks

873
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:08,810
they can't really do much with it they

874
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,880
could sell it for parts for 550 take out

875
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:13,460
various components and then sell that

876
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:14,900
bit by their over a few months I mean

877
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,520
that's fine

878
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:19,910
it's a profit being not getting the

879
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:21,620
money straight away or you remove iCloud

880
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:23,480
and now you have a 700 bucks device and

881
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:26,480
you can sell it immediately and get a

882
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:31,280
much more serious markup and then your

883
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:32,960
paycheck will be right there so again

884
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,100
this is where the two industries meet

885
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,720
we've gone from physical meets

886
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:38,690
cybercrimes of their meets sort of

887
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:40,819
legitimate industry it's where stuff

888
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:44,510
gets really really gray really really

889
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:46,280
messy and there are people who are not

890
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:48,410
happy with this in the right to repair

891
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,530
industry to be clear it's probably a

892
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:54,470
minority of this community that are

893
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:57,740
engaging the illegal aspect so this is a

894
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:59,270
quote from a prominent member of the

895
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:01,939
right to repair community in the United

896
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:04,009
States who to the he's saying this to

897
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:06,020
the people who are unlock iCloud and

898
00:36:04,010 --> 00:36:08,060
that sort of thing you were the reason

899
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:09,620
that the industry is looked at as an L

900
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:11,900
blue ugly stepchild

901
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:14,210
this guy's having meetings with senators

902
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:16,400
with lawmakers at various different

903
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:18,980
levels trying to tell them hey you

904
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,560
should pass law that means Apple should

905
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:23,270
you know give us more replacement parts

906
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:25,100
or Apple should give us more information

907
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:26,390
about the phones so then we can repair

908
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:30,110
them I mean there is a vibrant community

909
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:32,810
around lobbying for legislative change

910
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:33,890
like that this guy's saying we can't

911
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:35,630
really do that when I'm having a meeting

912
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:37,700
of a senator and then these people over

913
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:39,860
here are breaking into accounts it's D

914
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:42,529
legitimizing the right to repair

915
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:44,420
industry so much so that in a very

916
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:46,070
popular Facebook group or at least

917
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:48,620
popular within the right to repair

918
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:51,170
industry someone are thinking the

919
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:54,049
administrator recently asked should we

920
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:56,390
just ban I found unlocking posts from

921
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:57,590
this group and the majority said yes we

922
00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:00,290
don't want this to be part of our

923
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:03,620
community but clearly is still there

924
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:05,630
it's not going away some right to repair

925
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:08,450
people say it's a product of Apple

926
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:10,100
making it harder to remove iCloud I mean

927
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:11,120
I don't think you can really blame a

928
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,640
call for trying to tighten the security

929
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,950
of its users seriously and this is just

930
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,500
a side effect and it's now

931
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:21,310
having an impact upon this industry as

932
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:23,650
well so that was everything I just

933
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:26,529
wanted to say about unlocking iCloud

934
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:29,050
locks phones how those various

935
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:31,109
industries meet that's my signal number

936
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:34,390
if you want to send me I or so days

937
00:37:31,109 --> 00:37:36,460
that's my email address and Twitter as

938
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:38,828
well and if you have any more details

939
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:42,310
about this obviously feel free to

940
00:37:38,829 --> 00:37:46,260
contact me or anything else around Apple

941
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:46,259
exploitation thank you so much

942
00:37:49,980 --> 00:38:09,310
do we take questions or hide yeah yeah

943
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:12,940
yeah I'll just answer yes oh I don't

944
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:16,960
have any data on how much 2fa there is

945
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:19,240
used on iCloud accounts wasn't super

946
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,900
chatty when it came to sharing that sort

947
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,910
of data

948
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:27,569
I imagine it would not be the majority

949
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:31,839
and I suppose just the bounce off that

950
00:38:27,569 --> 00:38:33,819
2fa would would wipe this out entirely

951
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:35,799
like these hackers don't have the

952
00:38:33,819 --> 00:38:38,550
capability to fish for 2fa tokens as

953
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:41,470
well saying that I mean we all see

954
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:44,440
automated that scale or to if a token

955
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:46,060
fishing kits now they are around whether

956
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:49,150
it's for a Google Authenticator app to

957
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:51,460
get that token all the SMS token I just

958
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:52,450
haven't seen them incorporated into the

959
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:54,250
iCloud

960
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:57,399
fishing kids properly because they don't

961
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:59,079
need to to kind of get around to Alateen

962
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:02,640
question I don't think they need to get

963
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:02,640
around to a fakers is probably not there

964
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:10,859
if there's no

965
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,859
thank you I appreciate it
