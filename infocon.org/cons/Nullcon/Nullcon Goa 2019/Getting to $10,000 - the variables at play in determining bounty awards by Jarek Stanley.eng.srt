program not just thank you not just a

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,900
pitch for Microsoft bounty but things to

13
00:00:29,009 --> 00:00:32,730
understand and leverage to use to

14
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,879
exploit to earn even more bounty for

15
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:37,260
Microsoft some quality make up some

16
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,640
examples of high quality reports

17
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,500
something that's kind of new for our

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,000
program tell you how we measure how we

19
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,120
define this and how you can use those

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,890
same variables help your reports or even

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,419
more about it as well as some new

22
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:49,980
updates from the program I've made some

23
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,210
recent changes in the last few months a

24
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,379
few these I'll talk about with you guys

25
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:54,120
do today the first time we've talked

26
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:59,550
about this publicly to make it even

27
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:02,940
easier for you to succeed so intro

28
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,679
Microsoft bounty program encourages and

29
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,048
rewards security researchers or

30
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,000
researching Microsoft products finding

31
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:10,740
security vulnerabilities recording the

32
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,840
Microsoft and working with us through

33
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,979
coordinated owner Billy disclosure to

34
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,929
fix and publicize the bug so our buddy

35
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,999
program has opened it anybody whether

36
00:01:18,929 --> 00:01:23,549
you're a full-time security researcher a

37
00:01:20,999 --> 00:01:25,199
hobbyist part time we're just keeping

38
00:01:23,549 --> 00:01:28,799
your skills sharp on the side so it's

39
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,200
from open to all we believe that the

40
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,310
partnerships with you guys here in India

a couple ideas about what's at in scope

47

where we really focus and we reward

48
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:50,639
initial research and how you can learn

49
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:53,609
about that and focus your research in

50
00:01:50,639 --> 00:01:55,740
the same areas even in addition to

51
00:01:53,609 --> 00:01:57,240
bounty we welcome and we'll review every

52
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:59,520
case you submit to us on a case by case

53
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,589
basis if it's not in scope for a bounty

54
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,170
program we still offer recognition

55
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:06,030
awards for anyone it helps us fix and

56
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,139
secure and improve on products it's a

57
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,990
really great way to build a professional

58
00:02:07,139 --> 00:02:11,730
reputation we recognize people through

59
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,930
CDs as well as through online

60
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:14,929
submissions on our websites

61
00:02:15,209 --> 00:02:21,629
so bounty program let's see let's make

62
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,040
sure this is the right thing yeah so the

63
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:24,899
power bounty program covers a rough

64
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,150
launch of different Microsoft products

65
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:30,030
to include office and windows as well as

66
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:32,930
clouds cloud services also those online

67
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:36,450
services at your DevOps office 365's

68
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:41,189
large breadth of Microsoft products with

69
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:44,069
rewards from $500,000 to 15k for from

70
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:46,310
office insider up to 50k for windows of

71
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:48,869
owner abilities head up to two thousand

72
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:50,400
two hundred fifty thousand dollars for

73
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,200
Hyper virtualization or some other

74
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,939
really complex really tough and really

75
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,220
high priority for Microsoft issue areas

76
00:02:53,939 --> 00:02:58,230
but overall across all our bounty

77
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,870
programs just this last year we paid

78
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:04,260
over two million dollars

79
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:06,000
and Indian researchers make a really big

80
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:08,849
contribution there there's a lot of

81
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,519
talent creativity engagement here in

82
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:12,719
this room and around the country here so

83
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,189
just when the last year we paid over

84
00:03:12,719 --> 00:03:16,049
ninety thousand dollars and bounties to

85
00:03:14,189 --> 00:03:17,969
Indian researchers that's twice the

86
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:21,030
amount that we were able to award last

87
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:23,099
year and four of or Indian based

88
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:25,440
researchers have made our top 100 both

89
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:27,388
for Bali submissions as well as simply

90
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,879
for contributions to helping us fix our

91
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:30,959
products so how do you how do you earn

92
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:35,189
those bounties how do you get on that

93
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:37,379
list from a high level I'm gonna move a

94
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:38,608
little faster just to make sure that you

95
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:40,518
get to the content I'd love to leave

96
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:43,319
some time for you guys these questions

97
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:44,609
two key takeaways and these are very

98
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,849
high-level we'll get it to more detail

99
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:48,599
so you can actually use but the first is

100
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:51,418
submitting high-impact

101
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:53,819
reports on high-priority products earns

102
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:55,439
higher rewards and the second is by

103
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:58,948
improving the quality and completeness

104
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:01,168
of your reports can also improve the

105
00:03:58,949 --> 00:04:02,729
amount of bounty will earn per record

106
00:04:01,169 --> 00:04:07,620
show us how to reproduce your findings

107
00:04:02,729 --> 00:04:09,569
and I'll show you a bigger problem so

108
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:14,729
first off for that first point the high

109
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:18,000
impact high priority high-value number

110
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:19,590
one is read the bounty briefs we do as

111
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,820
much as possible from an economics

112
00:04:19,589 --> 00:04:22,619
perspective this is called limiting

113
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,360
information disparity I want you guys to

114
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,349
know as much as possible what we value

115
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,070
and what we reward

116
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:28,080
what's in and out

117
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:29,670
over the program I'm investing the last

118
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,620
few months and the next coming months to

119
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,820
make that easier needs to adjust more

120
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,800
and more information for you to start

121
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,810
with so you know where the target energy

122
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,760
where to target your creativity and

123
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:40,770
where we are offering them bounty awards

124
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,990
and what bounty works with Possible's so

125
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:45,510
end of the day I loved to award bounty

126
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:49,410
to free research for anyone across the

127
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:52,530
globe it's in scope absolutely out of

128
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:54,240
scope reports to learn no bounty and we

129
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:59,130
offer as much information and up front

130
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:01,080
to help you know what to expect a second

131
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:03,300
point that at Microsoft we use what's

132
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,479
known as a stride model to think about

133
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,340
the impact of pretty long abilities

134
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:10,160
stride stands for security tampering

135
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,659
repudiation information disclosure

136
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,220
denial service and elevator the

137
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:16,890
privilege and the bounty program have

138
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,270
also added remote code execution type of

139
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:19,469
elevation of privilege but it's

140
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,969
something that's really important to

141
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,620
spear of our products it's all offering

142
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:25,620
a higher award tier for those types of

143
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:27,390
vulnerabilities so there's a link down

144
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:29,220
on the slide I've got some resources in

145
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,650
the back those presentations learn about

146
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,180
this but what's what's in it for you the

147
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:35,580
takeaway is that we speaking at the same

148
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,720
language about a vulnerability we can

149
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,340
move a lot quicker through understanding

150
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,680
what we're looking at it and make sure

151
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,900
that we're getting right and buy right I

152
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:45,630
mean retired highest possible level

153
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:49,679
award for it vulnerabilities found I've

154
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:52,530
baked these directly into how we set the

155
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,660
awards for abdominals so for remote code

156
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,659
execution critical capability go ahead

157
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:00,960
little bit up on the volume you said

158
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:02,400
awesome hey thanks for the heads up I

159
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:05,159
appreciate that is sometimes hard to

160
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,169
hear in the back so for high critical

161
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,500
remote code execution we offer up to in

162
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:13,200
the cloud bounty specifically $20,000

163
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:16,620
which is quite a significant uh bounty

164
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:18,450
award elevation of privileged critical

165
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:19,800
severity eight thousand dollars even

166
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,430
spoofing were a lot of cross-site

167
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,770
scripting

168
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:24,300
falls three thousand dollars for an

169
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,219
important severity high quality award

170
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:28,710
but you notice here you have a lot of

171
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:30,930
phrasing it's up to up to how do we

172
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:33,000
decide up to what well there's another

173
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:34,440
vulnerability to play or another

174
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,040
variable apply I should say called

175
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,750
quality um in the day the takeaway is

176
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,730
the higher quality you're at

177
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:45,390
the more value awards we offer for that

178
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:46,410
report that's not too bad but I'm going

179
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:48,330
to tell you a bit more about how we

180
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:50,580
measure that and give you an example

181
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,530
building on the same report about adding

182
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,359
more and more information specific

183
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:55,770
information that gets you from a low

184
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:57,690
quality to a medium quality of a high

185
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,240
quality a low bounty to a medium value

186
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:02,550
to a highest value possible but

187
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,590
productive or provide clear concise

188
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,990
information about the vulnerability

189
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:09,810
including a version configuration data

190
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:12,330
or possible really improves our ability

191
00:07:09,810 --> 00:07:14,310
to begin to reproduce researches

192
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,780
vulnerability respond to you fast within

193
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:19,070
your out of scope and with a boundary

194
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:21,510
reward well written instructions

195
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:23,880
well-thought-out repro steps in the

196
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:26,250
cloud bounty and more than double the

197
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:27,930
award for the same vulnerability give us

198
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:30,750
more information give us make more

199
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,980
effort and will reward you for that and

200
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,640
then even addition if you can talk about

201
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:37,680
attack vectors some root cause analysis

202
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,330
potential fixes I'll take it even

203
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,010
further it's more valuable for our

204
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:43,260
customers it helps us understand how

205
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:47,159
best to secure them and we really want

206
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:49,380
to reward you for that effort so let's

207
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,460
take a look at some real-world examples

208
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:54,840
of low medium and high quality reports

209
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,159
so the first one it's kind of goes

210
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,200
without saying but I've got to say it

211
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,090
anyway we've got to be able to reproduce

212
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:02,060
the report this is one of my favorites

213
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:04,710
it's all your stuff is broken

214
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:06,240
description and fix your stuff bro now I

215
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:08,729
appreciate the extra bro it's a little

216
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,950
personal note there by any of the teams

217
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:12,450
we can't reproduce the teens just enough

218
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,610
information you start investigation

219
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,710
we've got some incredible minds Matt

220
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,030
Miller and others Gaurav who is here in

221
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:19,530
the audience today will do everything

222
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,929
they can to figure out what's going on

223
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:23,429
but in the day if we can't repro it what

224
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,630
can't award you a bounty or recognize

225
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:28,080
you for helping us protect our customers

226
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:31,200
and the broader ecosystem no low-quality

227
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,699
examples now I guess I think I'd like to

228
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,770
rephrase quality into completeness

229
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:38,030
because this is still this is a very

230
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:41,189
useful report it gives us some general

231
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:43,348
domains some description of what the

232
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:44,940
vulnerable are seeing and this earns a

233
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:48,120
bounty reward absolutely it gives us

234
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:49,440
enough to start our investigation figure

235
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,030
out what's going on and think about a

236
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,340
face so this

237
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:56,500
we'd love reports like this but the

238
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:59,290
result is potential a little slower

239
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:01,420
response to your submission they'll take

240
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:04,510
us longer to read through this do some

241
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:07,569
investigations see we can find a lower

242
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:10,090
bound reward of course this is sort of

243
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:12,070
the minimum formation to qualify bounty

244
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:13,930
as well as if we don't understand it the

245
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:16,540
same way you do we may not give you the

246
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:18,969
right again right read hired as high as

247
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:20,920
possible bounty award so this same

248
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:23,200
report if you added a little bit more

249
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:25,209
information can move to a medium quality

250
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,640
and even the higher board self same

251
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:30,340
report here's the next step clear

252
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:32,560
concise easy to read easy you steps to

253
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:35,110
reproduce these vulnerabilities again

254
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,969
real or exemplar so we received work

255
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:42,520
through and rewarded this exact report

256
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:45,760
so sharing some of your thinking how our

257
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:47,260
teams can reproduce so huge help this

258
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,420
gets us a faster response we can

259
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:51,400
understand right away what was going on

260
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,490
reproduced on our own systems and start

261
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:56,530
working towards the fix and start

262
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,940
awarding bounty also it helps us

263
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:59,079
understand the same way you did so we

264
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:05,380
make sure we award you at the right

265
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:06,700
level of bounty and then uh yeah this is

266
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:10,180
this is pretty darn good most

267
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:12,220
researchers will stop here but I want to

268
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:14,290
give it an extra idea of some steps you

269
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,090
can take even even high quality a higher

270
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:18,040
quality and even higher award from the

271
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:19,330
Microsoft bounty program some of this

272
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,300
stuff you'll see echoed in Adams

273
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:23,680
presentation in Jason's this morning but

274
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:25,870
certainly applies to Microsoft on a

275
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,520
program high quality analysis or

276
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:30,580
additional analysis some additional

277
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:32,770
thinking Adam said one of the things

278
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:34,030
that they're looking for for folks to

279
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:35,710
hire through buying programs which

280
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:37,480
Microsoft does as well it's your ability

281
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,790
to articulate to think kind of share

282
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:44,260
your story so analysis about root cause

283
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:46,329
I'm even code snippets potentially where

284
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:48,220
the patterns are where you see this in

285
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:49,720
other products this is incredibly

286
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,830
valuable to the team can't get us

287
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,180
thinking beyond this specific

288
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:54,310
vulnerability to other vulnerabilities

289
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:56,380
help us get the best fix for our

290
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,150
customers in the ecosystem and we reward

291
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:00,220
you for the additional effort this is

292
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:02,680
just one example but I hope by showing

293
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:04,000
am low medium high quality gives you

294
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,799
some concrete stuff I'll put these

295
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,239
online right after this present

296
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:10,239
that you can use in your vulnerability

297
00:11:07,239 --> 00:11:12,609
submissions but let's see how this pays

298
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:16,029
out so stride understand the impact

299
00:11:12,609 --> 00:11:17,349
quality severity equals exactly bounty

300
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:19,449
this is the same information it's on our

301
00:11:17,349 --> 00:11:20,859
public website if this was an elevation

302
00:11:19,449 --> 00:11:22,899
of privileged bounty you can see the low

303
00:11:20,859 --> 00:11:25,239
quality report would have earned $1,000

304
00:11:22,899 --> 00:11:26,979
she's still pretty significant we really

305
00:11:25,239 --> 00:11:28,569
want you to report to find and report

306
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:29,889
vulnerabilities and will thank you for

307
00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:33,098
the effort no matter what that level

308
00:11:29,889 --> 00:11:36,699
effort is but adding those reproter in

309
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:38,589
person steps yeah this is pretty small

310
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:40,029
you might not be able to see that in the

311
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:42,249
back of the room but it doubles the

312
00:11:40,029 --> 00:11:43,749
bounty and will go from $1000 thousand

313
00:11:42,249 --> 00:11:44,529
US dollar bounty to a two thousand

314
00:11:43,749 --> 00:11:46,449
dollar bounty

315
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:48,399
add those additional thinking that steps

316
00:11:46,449 --> 00:11:49,719
about attack vectors talking us through

317
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:52,149
how you found the ability how you're

318
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:54,879
thinking of the patterns multiply the

319
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:57,249
value award by five under five thousand

320
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:59,109
dollar bounty for adding that additional

321
00:11:57,249 --> 00:12:01,239
information we know this is hard it's

322
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:02,439
sometimes difficult it's hard to find

323
00:12:01,239 --> 00:12:04,209
them all and really start it late to

324
00:12:02,439 --> 00:12:07,118
understand them we really want to reward

325
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:08,559
you for that for that extra effort we're

326
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:10,029
doing this in the cloud bounty this is

327
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:11,469
actually the payout structure and table

328
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:13,629
from the cloud bounty the windows

329
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:15,279
donated a DevOps bounty but rolling this

330
00:12:13,629 --> 00:12:17,979
out slug to all of Microsoft's bounty

331
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:21,309
programs let's see how we doing with

332
00:12:17,979 --> 00:12:23,889
time let's queue bad talking to the team

333
00:12:21,309 --> 00:12:25,299
about any other tips I could share today

334
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:26,970
with this community and the folks that

335
00:12:25,299 --> 00:12:29,379
maybe read this presentation afterwards

336
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:33,489
to others laying out your assumptions is

337
00:12:29,379 --> 00:12:36,579
a really big help if you've made

338
00:12:33,489 --> 00:12:38,409
particular choices in your your repo

339
00:12:36,579 --> 00:12:40,209
your system your set up making that

340
00:12:38,409 --> 00:12:41,679
explicitly reports of big helps the

341
00:12:40,209 --> 00:12:43,179
research engineers on our side will you

342
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:44,409
just have a brand new test system to

343
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,209
repro and if they've missed something

344
00:12:44,409 --> 00:12:47,439
that you've done on your end it can

345
00:12:46,209 --> 00:12:50,529
often take a longer time for us to

346
00:12:47,439 --> 00:12:53,439
respond understand and also and this is

347
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:55,959
Adam mission the same thing share us

348
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:57,549
share with us your thinking from the

349
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:59,018
attackers perspective what can you do

350
00:12:57,549 --> 00:13:01,629
with this vulnerability how did you find

351
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:04,119
this vulnerability really helped us kind

352
00:13:01,629 --> 00:13:09,220
of get into your your head there's part

353
00:13:04,119 --> 00:13:11,019
of you there's often a lot of work and

354
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:12,609
energy that goes into these but that's

355
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:14,799
not all can make it onto paper so put it

356
00:13:12,609 --> 00:13:16,329
on paper in a structured format I'm all

357
00:13:14,799 --> 00:13:18,360
try and reward you as possible as high

358
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:25,660
as possible for it

359
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:27,670
and finally Hartley finally we're

360
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:30,520
working to make it easier if you succeed

361
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:32,050
in the value program every day the joke

362
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,699
here is the number one way we make it

363
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:35,800
easier is by releasing new code and new

364
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,480
products it's always easier to find

365
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,000
suitable for the protis and new stuff

366
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,280
but in reality we're also changing how

367
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,630
we run this program how we engage with

368
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,120
community to make it easier for you to

369
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:48,939
succeed so three ways we've done that is

370
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,070
the last couple months one eye crease

371
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:54,490
rewards across the board in Windows

372
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:56,380
cloud and Azure DevOps from 15,000 to

373
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:58,840
20,000 for our top award and cloud and

374
00:13:56,380 --> 00:14:01,510
up to 50,000 US Dollars our top award

375
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:03,930
and it does it salt reward you more with

376
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:06,760
higher bounties for the same products

377
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:08,170
one of the major ways we're hoping to

378
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:10,210
improve the experience of that bounty

379
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:12,699
program is awarding your vulnerabilities

380
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:14,560
on our ability to reproduce it in the

381
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,930
past we've waited for a fix to be

382
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,760
confirmed which means a few weeks to a

383
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:20,020
few months before you even got any

384
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:22,060
feedback of whether it's a good

385
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:26,199
vulnerability and what kind of bounty in

386
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:28,449
like you might earn so in the new system

387
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,440
with cloud and Windows as soon as we're

388
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:31,480
able to reproduce your availability

389
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:34,030
we'll give you the assessment and we'll

390
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,620
offer a value award whether we fix it or

391
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:37,569
not we really want to thank you for the

392
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:40,720
effort if we recognizes the value on

393
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:42,160
durability we will make that award we've

394
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,620
also changed our duplicate policies

395
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,319
Microsoft employees over 3,500

396
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:49,690
securities festivals professionals or

397
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,700
researching and continuously securing

398
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:53,890
our products every day we find a live

399
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:56,350
our own vulnerabilities but it can take

400
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:58,240
us some time to determine the fix and

401
00:14:56,350 --> 00:15:00,760
release that if you're the first

402
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,440
external researcher who's found this

403
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:03,700
vulnerability and report with us we'll

404
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,590
still give you full bounded weather we

405
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,570
knew about it beforehand and not why

406
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:09,970
because it still creates a lot of value

407
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:12,580
for us and our customers to know that

408
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:14,590
you guys can find it without code source

409
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:17,110
code access without some of the training

410
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:20,470
and context and abilities you can find

411
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:22,630
it outside it lets us know the priority

412
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,130
for fixing it and can even help us

413
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:25,960
determine what the best way to fix it is

414
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:28,210
so we've made these three changes

415
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:30,040
awarding quite a bit more for bounty

416
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:32,019
orden quite a bit faster

417
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:33,610
for bounty and awarding everything

418
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:35,709
that's coming in the door that's new to

419
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:37,570
us to make it even easier for anybody

420
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:40,060
who's researching on Microsoft products

421
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:41,380
to succeed yeah and we'll keep adding

422
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:43,630
things to make sure that your experience

423
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:48,639
with the Adamic program is successful as

424
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:50,050
possible so here's a slide some

425
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:52,449
additional resources learning more about

426
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,979
the program about the stride model our

427
00:15:52,449 --> 00:15:56,529
thoughts on coordinated vulnerability

428
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:57,519
SCO's disclosure and some recent

429
00:15:56,529 --> 00:15:59,380
presentations

430
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,600
my team and I Grogg Matt Miller and

431
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,220
others ten years putting out blogs over

432
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,050
the coming year to help researchers get

433
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:08,170
started one of our first with some hyper

434
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:09,430
hyper virtualization a hyper-v which

435
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:11,920
offers bounty Awards up to two hundred

436
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:13,388
and fifty thousand dollars it's huge for

437
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,089
us it's really hard it's really

438
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:18,490
complicated but it's very very important

439
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:20,620
so why we offer such high bounty levels

440
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:22,480
and it's also why we're starting to try

441
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:24,850
and provide some more contents and

442
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,620
training to help you guys get started ok

443
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,120
it's still very difficult there's a

444
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,009
reason why we have to we're offering

445
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,170
such a large bounty but we're trying to

446
00:16:30,009 --> 00:16:34,060
give you as much as many tools as

447
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:36,040
possible as much idea and context to get

448
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:38,589
you started so from online services to

449
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:40,569
Windows to office some of our more

450
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:42,279
esoteric more complex cloud services

451
00:16:40,569 --> 00:16:43,269
particularly be putting out more and

452
00:16:42,279 --> 00:16:45,880
more and more to help the security

453
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:47,829
research community engage and welcome

454
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,939
your feedback at the bottom there again

455
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:50,138
you guys probably can't see in the back

456
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,720
of the room us but there's some email

457
00:16:50,139 --> 00:16:54,639
address give us your thoughts your

458
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,199
feedback what you'd like to see your

459
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,610
experience we're always listening to

460
00:16:56,199 --> 00:17:03,459
what we're hearing and trying to make

461
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:05,620
the best diamond program possible so

462
00:17:03,459 --> 00:17:09,428
wrapping up this leave us a little bit

463
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:12,969
more time for questions first one is

464
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:14,949
focus on high impact in scope high

465
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:16,750
priority targets best way to do that is

466
00:17:14,949 --> 00:17:18,130
read the bounty brief we're gonna keep

467
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,589
playing out more information keep

468
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:23,380
expanding our scope as our products and

469
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:25,059
services change the second is improve

470
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:26,949
your core quality by adding additional

471
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:28,418
information some of those concrete steps

472
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:31,360
that give you example about free Pro

473
00:17:28,419 --> 00:17:32,950
steps attack vectors on suggested fixes

474
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:35,110
all of those will earn higher and higher

475
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:37,000
bound Awards and then finally we're

476
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:39,610
going to continue to grow expand this

477
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,180
bounty program both in ways that easier

478
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:42,399
succeed

479
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,870
and that make it easier and more

480
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:47,470
productive for us to engage the better

481
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:50,260
the scope Microsoft is Microsoft is

482
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:52,210
growing quite rapidly especially cloud

483
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:54,340
and so those services as those products

484
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,840
grow as a complexity girl I'm going to

485
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,639
build the bounty program to match that

486
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,050
to better secure our customers there's

487
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,690
always going to be new opportunities set

488
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:04,360
up in the program so check back as I add

489
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:05,860
more online services more domains and

490
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,770
keep moving forward

491
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:10,330
so end of the day I hope you guys are

492
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:12,160
able to walk away well some of the

493
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:13,600
presentation with some ideas about if

494
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,570
you're already pissing the program how

495
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:18,790
to earn either hire bounty Awards and

496
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:20,560
looking like with other programs by

497
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:22,270
sharing some of our thinking combined
