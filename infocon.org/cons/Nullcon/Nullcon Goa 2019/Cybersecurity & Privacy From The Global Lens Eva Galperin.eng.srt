1
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:07,379
thank you so much for coming I'm always

2
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:09,910
so surprised when the room fills up

3
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,530
alright let me not get in the way of my

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:14,379
slides I swear I've done this before

5
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:17,830
thank you so much for having me back

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:20,230
last year I was the first talk on this

7
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:23,288
track and I was made entirely of

8
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:26,380
technical difficulties so think of this

9
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:29,680
as another opportunity to to get it

10
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:31,390
right my name is Eva galperin I work for

11
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:33,760
the Electronic Frontier Foundation where

12
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,960
I am the director of cybersecurity the

13
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,120
good news is that there are lots of

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,180
people here who already know what EF F

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,578
is which saves me a lot of time we're

16
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:47,680
basically a sticker and t-shirt company

17
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:50,680
with a law firm attached so Who am I I

18
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,200
direct all of the cybers essentially

19
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,269
what this means is that for a very long

20
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,370
time I worked on EFS international team

21
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:59,219
and I spent a lot of time worrying about

22
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:01,780
privacy and security all over the world

23
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:04,119
this year things are a little bit

24
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:07,450
different I have been granted my own lab

25
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:10,299
we call this FF threat lab and I have a

26
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:11,890
team of people work for me I and we

27
00:01:10,299 --> 00:01:14,130
spend all of our time weren't worried

28
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:17,140
about security and privacy for

29
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,899
especially vulnerable populations so I

30
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:21,580
started my career trying to expand the

31
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:25,799
idea of vulnerable populations to

32
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:32,979
include activists all over the world and

33
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:34,720
then journalists and NGOs working in in

34
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:38,770
sketchy places like the United States

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:42,570
and finally I've spent the last year

36
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:46,210
working on domestic abuse cases so

37
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:50,169
fighting stalker wear and spyware so

38
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:53,079
when when people are offered software or

39
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:54,790
they buy software in order to spy on on

40
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:57,189
their spouses or their loved ones as

41
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:58,479
part of domestic abuse that's really one

42
00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:00,699
of the things that I have been tracking

43
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:05,170
and trying to eliminate because it's

44
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:05,950
terrible so I'm going to go over real

45
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:09,459
really quick

46
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:10,869
who aff is one more time everybody hands

47
00:02:09,459 --> 00:02:11,920
up if you've heard of the Electronic

48
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:14,319
Frontier Foundation

49
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,010
my beloved t-shirt and sticker company

50
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,879
with a law firm attached

51
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:21,920
indeed in in addition to occasionally

52
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:25,899
filing lawsuits and making a series of

53
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,548
excellent t-shirts and stickers i FF

54
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:31,010
makes sure that when you go online your

55
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:33,069
rights come with you and one of the most

56
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,849
important parts of our work is

57
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:37,010
acknowledging that the Internet is

58
00:02:34,849 --> 00:02:38,959
global and that the Internet's problems

59
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:42,140
are global and you're not just going to

60
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,329
solve it with lawyers located in San

61
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:46,399
Francisco and in fact one of the biggest

62
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:49,459
problems that technology has really had

63
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:53,000
I think in the last several decades is

64
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:54,859
that our platforms and a lot of the law

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,709
and a lot of the decisions that

66
00:02:54,859 --> 00:03:01,549
influence our daily digital lives are

67
00:02:57,709 --> 00:03:03,889
made by people who don't understand the

68
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:07,220
lives of people who are not like them so

69
00:03:03,889 --> 00:03:09,680
they're generally made by middle-class

70
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:11,450
white guys living in Santa Clara and

71
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,370
middle-class black guys in Santa Clara

72
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,899
don't understand the problems of people

73
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:16,670
who are not middle-class white guys

74
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:22,669
living in Santa Clara which is almost

75
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:25,190
everybody else in the world so in

76
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:28,579
addition to doing this sort of activism

77
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:31,519
and broadening our idea of who is online

78
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:33,769
and who deserves respect and

79
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,639
consideration when we're making tech

80
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:41,419
policy and laws we also do legal work we

81
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:44,239
I personally have an entire floor of

82
00:03:41,419 --> 00:03:47,859
angry American attack lawyers I and they

83
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:51,620
love nothing more than to file lawsuits

84
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:53,090
EF F is very popular at hacker

85
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:55,579
conferences because a lot of people

86
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:59,150
consider them to be there are emergency

87
00:03:55,579 --> 00:04:00,319
lawyers if they get caught we have we

88
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:03,889
have a thing called the coders Rights

89
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:07,518
Project where if you are doing security

90
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:10,099
research and you are concerned about the

91
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,979
legality of what you're doing or that

92
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:14,060
you want to talk about your research but

93
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:16,760
you are concerned that you are going to

94
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:18,589
be sued by the makers of the product

95
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:21,349
that you are researching or the company

96
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:23,599
that you are researching or a government

97
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:25,120
whose malfeasance you are you're

98
00:04:23,599 --> 00:04:27,130
uncovering

99
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,490
we are the people that you go to in

100
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:33,909
advance not after you have already given

101
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:35,979
your talk but before and we can give you

102
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:40,270
advice about how to do this safely and

103
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:43,120
securely and also we can arrange for you

104
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:47,070
to get legal representation in in the

105
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:51,039
case that that somebody comes after you

106
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:53,740
we also do some activism one of the

107
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:57,520
things that I'm particularly proud of is

108
00:04:53,740 --> 00:05:00,160
that the EF f has been suing the United

109
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,289
States government over its warrantless

110
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,919
wiretapping program which was carried

111
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:08,259
out by the National Security Agency

112
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:10,630
since 2006 the program has been going on

113
00:05:08,259 --> 00:05:14,729
since 2003 we've been suing them since

114
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:16,930
2006 we are now in year 13 of suing them

115
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:19,750
because the wheels of justice grind

116
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:22,000
slowly but we think it's extremely

117
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,729
important to hold government's

118
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,440
accountable and especially for this sort

119
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:28,539
of mass surveillance which violates

120
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:30,280
everybody's civil rights all over the

121
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:33,430
world and takes advantage of the fact

122
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:37,330
that the United States has this central

123
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:39,610
role in the physical layout of the

124
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:42,300
internet so so much stuff goes through

125
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:47,020
so much traffic goes through the u.s.

126
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:49,180
that the NSA was and still is in a sort

127
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,969
of special position when it comes to

128
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:53,770
being able to spy on everything one of

129
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:55,810
the other things that we do in terms of

130
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:58,330
activism is we've done activism against

131
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:01,090
the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act which

132
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:03,729
is the law in the United States under

133
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:07,119
which hackers are generally prosecuted

134
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:08,650
and we found that this is also the law

135
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,780
which is used to prosecute people who

136
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:12,940
are doing perfectly innocent security

137
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:16,469
research when the targets of their

138
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:19,060
research don't like what they're doing

139
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,729
and again finally we do international

140
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,520
work because the internet is

141
00:06:20,729 --> 00:06:26,080
international it's problems are global

142
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:30,060
one of the things that I spent a couple

143
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:33,219
of years doing was working on changes in

144
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,870
2013 to the vaasana' arrangement which

145
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:37,539
it took me a very long time to spell

146
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,120
correctly the vaasana' arrangement does

147
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:40,550
in a Karim

148
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:45,830
between annex 49 countries all over the

149
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:48,530
world and it usually governs the export

150
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:50,260
of weapons but when a whole bunch of

151
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:52,820
stories hit about the use of

152
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:55,789
surveillance malware made by companies

153
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:59,139
like finfisher and Gama International

154
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:03,050
Gama International is a gamma was

155
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:05,600
finfisher is a spin-off of gamma and

156
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:08,630
hacking team and NSO groups all of these

157
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:11,000
stories came out and then a bunch of

158
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:14,389
European MEP said something must be done

159
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:17,540
and what we should do is we should we

160
00:07:14,389 --> 00:07:21,650
should classify surveillance malware as

161
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:24,470
a weapon and we it should be governed by

162
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,880
these export controls and security

163
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:31,310
researchers took one look at that and

164
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:34,340
said what excuse me you're going to make

165
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:37,970
me get an export license in order to use

166
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:40,820
my compiler or do any kind of research

167
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:42,080
across international borders my life is

168
00:07:40,820 --> 00:07:44,330
about to get a whole lot more difficult

169
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,280
so we spent some time trying to roll

170
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:49,310
that back because we think that these

171
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:55,219
this language was especially poorly

172
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:58,940
written EFS also has a technology team

173
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:00,500
we spent a bunch of time working on

174
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,940
technology projects that we think are

175
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,099
going to make the internet better for

176
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:06,740
everybody so some of you may be familiar

177
00:08:04,099 --> 00:08:10,520
with cert bot if you run a website and

178
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:13,550
you have a free cert that allows you to

179
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:17,109
support HTTP it probably came from cert

180
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:20,389
bot you're welcome we also make the

181
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:23,169
browser extensions privacy badger which

182
00:08:20,389 --> 00:08:25,340
eats cookies because it doesn't care and

183
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:26,719
HTTPS Everywhere which makes sure that

184
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:28,609
when you are going to a website if it

185
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:35,510
supports HTTP that you're doing so by

186
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:37,789
default so usually when I start talking

187
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:41,409
about our work around activists and

188
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:44,420
journalists and lawyers I need to start

189
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:47,150
with why why do we need to care about

190
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:48,860
these people and primarily the reason

191
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,610
why we need to care about journalists

192
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,680
and act

193
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,690
fists and lawyers why these are

194
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,279
particularly vulnerable populations is

195
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,470
because these are the populations that

196
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:02,720
speak truth to power these are the

197
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:06,290
people who keep power in check and as a

198
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,959
result they piss off people in power and

199
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:11,390
people in power are extremely interested

200
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,949
in knowing what they're doing one of the

201
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:15,170
things that's really changed a lot in

202
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:17,899
the last couple of decades is that it

203
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:20,510
used to be hard to spy on journalists

204
00:09:17,899 --> 00:09:23,329
and activists and lawyers if you wanted

205
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:25,670
to know what they were doing you had to

206
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:28,489
say break into their homes you had to

207
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:31,760
convince their family members to snitch

208
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:34,850
on them you had to go and steal their

209
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,709
notebooks but now everyone conveniently

210
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:39,800
carries a tracking device around in

211
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:41,390
their pocket as well as conducting

212
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,390
nearly all of their business

213
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:47,360
I in the digital realm which makes it

214
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:51,790
unusually easy for governments to track

215
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:56,209
it so this sort of surveillance is is

216
00:09:51,790 --> 00:10:01,219
widely near universally beloved by

217
00:09:56,209 --> 00:10:06,170
abusive governments so this is a Barrett

218
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:09,019
Brown who had the very interesting

219
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:10,550
distinction of being both a journalist

220
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:11,839
and a hacker who had to go and spend

221
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:15,319
some time in jail because he wanted to

222
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:18,079
protect his sources I keep him in there

223
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:22,760
because frequently when we start talking

224
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:25,370
about the mistreatment of journalists

225
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:26,810
and activists it is really common in the

226
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,640
United States to pretend that this is

227
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:30,709
something that happens in other people's

228
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,560
countries that the world is divided up

229
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:35,719
into the West and the rest and that the

230
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:37,729
u.s. is great and we have the First

231
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:39,980
Amendment and we have all kinds of great

232
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:42,230
rights and then meanwhile there are all

233
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:44,540
of these other lesser countries and

234
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:47,209
they're running around engaging in human

235
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:48,949
rights abuses I am here to tell you the

236
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:50,599
u.s. engages in plenty of human rights

237
00:10:48,949 --> 00:10:52,430
abuses and it's extremely important to

238
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,760
hold them accountable just as well as

239
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:59,329
everybody else so the thing that

240
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,300
concerns me greatly is seafood but also

241
00:10:59,329 --> 00:11:04,469
a sim

242
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:07,829
I hate police I became an activist

243
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:10,580
because I really hate bullies and I

244
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:13,230
can't stand to watch people in power

245
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:16,110
kick down at the people who are supposed

246
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:19,200
to keep them in check it is really

247
00:11:16,110 --> 00:11:22,410
common for journalists and activists and

248
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,150
people working at NGOs not to really

249
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:26,939
have much in the way of digital

250
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,590
protection when governments spy on other

251
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:31,440
governments when governments spy on

252
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:36,060
professional spies they have tradecraft

253
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:38,370
they have training they have entire

254
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:42,540
government support systems for their

255
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:44,700
work journalists don't have a huge

256
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:47,490
security team that can spend all of its

257
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:51,360
time supporting them in in their

258
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:54,150
security concerns activists don't have

259
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,740
like a six-person security team that

260
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:58,980
they can call whenever their phone is

261
00:11:55,740 --> 00:12:00,570
doing something funny lawyers don't have

262
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:02,190
somebody that they can call when

263
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:04,890
something weird is happening on their

264
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:08,130
computer and that makes them really easy

265
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:09,810
to own because so far pretty much the

266
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:13,430
only people that they have to call are

267
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:13,430
like PFF and citizen lot

268
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:17,880
so one of the things that I would like

269
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:21,150
to say about the project that I'm about

270
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:23,460
to describe is that work is not done by

271
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:26,130
heroic individual rockstars

272
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:28,620
the work that I am about to describe was

273
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:31,439
done in a team it was done in a large

274
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:33,300
group in collaboration so the people who

275
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,740
really did a whole lot of the work are

276
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,240
not me

277
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:38,610
they are people like Michael flossman

278
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,620
from lookout Andrew Blake from lookout

279
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:47,970
and my fabulous colleague Cooper Quinton

280
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:49,980
who I'm especially fond of so we all had

281
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:52,410
to work together in order to make this

282
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:54,720
happen and if anybody ever brings you a

283
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:56,459
project this big and acts like it just

284
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:58,440
sprung like Athena from the head of Zeus

285
00:12:56,460 --> 00:13:01,200
and that they are personally responsible

286
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:03,000
for it and aren't they so cool look for

287
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:06,780
the people who are standing behind them

288
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,680
nobody does this stuff alone so I'm

289
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:11,920
going to talk to you a little bit about

290
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:18,040
dark caracal this is the caracal

291
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:18,429
is a wildcat native to the the Middle

292
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,529
East

293
00:13:18,429 --> 00:13:25,600
and you will see in a bit why I've

294
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:34,059
decided to name my apt after a Katy huh

295
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:37,720
Oh fantastic so a little bit about dark

296
00:13:34,059 --> 00:13:39,939
caracal duty to do there is a care call

297
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:43,779
there's some background it all started

298
00:13:39,939 --> 00:13:48,339
with this other cat this is a manual or

299
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:51,399
a palace cat or an adorable cartoon of a

300
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:55,350
manual or a palace cat this cat is

301
00:13:51,399 --> 00:14:01,239
native to the steppes of Kazakhstan and

302
00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:06,939
probably about in 2015-2016 I was

303
00:14:01,239 --> 00:14:10,299
contacted by some by a lawyer who was

304
00:14:06,939 --> 00:14:13,089
working with a group of people who had

305
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:14,799
angered the government of Kazakhstan and

306
00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:17,259
they were getting some strange emails

307
00:14:14,799 --> 00:14:20,619
with some amusing attachments and so we

308
00:14:17,259 --> 00:14:23,619
spent some time analyzing them we found

309
00:14:20,619 --> 00:14:27,879
there SI toos we found all their malware

310
00:14:23,619 --> 00:14:29,230
and and we wrote it up in a report so we

311
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:32,079
were extremely proud of ourselves

312
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:35,769
because this was a very noisy kind of

313
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:37,508
not very sophisticated apt it was fairly

314
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:42,730
clear to us that it was Kazakhstan

315
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:44,860
because we had a fairly good idea of who

316
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:46,959
was being targeted and it was entirely

317
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:49,179
people who were being sued by the

318
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:54,189
government of Kazakhstan because they

319
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:58,059
were enemies of the ruling party and we

320
00:14:54,189 --> 00:15:00,730
thought it was these guys yes so we

321
00:14:58,059 --> 00:15:03,429
thought it was hackers for hire and that

322
00:15:00,730 --> 00:15:05,649
the hackers for hire were Indian that

323
00:15:03,429 --> 00:15:09,399
they were they were a pin a pin is an

324
00:15:05,649 --> 00:15:11,410
extremely noisy actor they were for hire

325
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:14,619
for just about anybody with two dollars

326
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:17,079
to rub together and as a result there

327
00:15:14,619 --> 00:15:19,299
were many IP addresses and many domains

328
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:20,640
that were associated with a pin as an

329
00:15:19,299 --> 00:15:25,380
actor

330
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:28,560
what we ended up discovering was no not

331
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:34,439
then it turns out that the story was in

332
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:38,459
fact much much weirder which brings us

333
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:39,990
to dark carrot comb so one day I'm

334
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:42,060
sitting around the office at EF F and we

335
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:44,209
get a phone call from from a couple of

336
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:49,979
security researchers that look out and

337
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:51,479
they tell us hey we have found a bunch

338
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,250
of other stuff that overlaps with your

339
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:58,260
CNCs and we think that it's the same

340
00:15:53,250 --> 00:16:01,170
actor only it's not targeting this group

341
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:03,240
of Kazakhs and people who are being who

342
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:05,399
are being sued or who are suing the

343
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,670
government of Kazakhstan it's this whole

344
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:09,870
other group over here

345
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:14,519
fortunately they left their CNC is wide

346
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:15,990
open my colleague Cooper said hey the

347
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:17,760
last time that we were working on this

348
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:20,250
they left their CNC is wide open and in

349
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,140
fact they left all their directories

350
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,690
wide open and we managed to pull all the

351
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:29,029
data off their CNCs you don't think

352
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:32,370
they've done that again have they yes

353
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:37,560
yes they have I track only the most

354
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:41,579
incompetent a PT's secure the things

355
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:43,170
that we found in operation manual

356
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:46,229
because we pulled down all of this

357
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:49,769
information we pulled down a secure

358
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:52,079
messaging signal whatsapp primo plus

359
00:16:49,769 --> 00:16:54,620
messenger all kinds of weird stuff what

360
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:57,029
they were using were these sort of

361
00:16:54,620 --> 00:17:00,839
trojan eyes apps that they would then

362
00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:01,939
sideload so nearly all of this was was

363
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:05,400
Android malware

364
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:07,049
and it was designed to look like all of

365
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:10,290
these really common apps that people use

366
00:17:07,049 --> 00:17:12,089
in in their everyday lives especially if

367
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:14,159
they're interested in avoiding

368
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:17,549
governments so you get stuff like

369
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:20,520
signaling whatsapp or or BOTS and

370
00:17:17,549 --> 00:17:23,099
psyphon and then you've got a couple of

371
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,449
like things that everybody uses like

372
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:29,909
google play and things that nobody

373
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:34,500
should use like Flash Player so again we

374
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:39,450
managed to accelerate all of this data

375
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:41,370
I it the malware that we found has a

376
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,630
whole bunch of capabilities it could

377
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:45,299
take photos with the front or back

378
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:48,990
camera it intercepted incoming text

379
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:51,389
messages I it could retrieve your GPS

380
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:54,289
data silently record audio with the

381
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:57,508
device microphone retrieve your contacts

382
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:58,889
scan nearby Wi-Fi access points and

383
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:02,370
exfiltrate information about them

384
00:17:58,889 --> 00:18:05,158
including their be SSID and SSID

385
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:08,549
authentication key management encryption

386
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:10,799
schemes signal strength and frequency

387
00:18:08,549 --> 00:18:13,769
you've got the device metadata the text

388
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:15,570
messages it will send an SMS to an

389
00:18:13,769 --> 00:18:16,950
attacker at a specified number so that

390
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:19,950
it can take advantage of the fact that

391
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:22,710
you trust the person that whose device

392
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:24,360
you've just owned it will retrieve

393
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:26,100
messages and any corresponding

394
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,049
decryption keys from messaging apps and

395
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:30,658
retrieve a list of installed packages

396
00:18:28,049 --> 00:18:33,029
bunch of other stuff so generally once

397
00:18:30,659 --> 00:18:34,590
you own a phone you own a phone you gain

398
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:38,039
many many powers you have many things

399
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:40,860
that you can exfiltrate this should be

400
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:43,740
the attack vectors here we go so the

401
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:45,059
primary attack vector was phishing

402
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,460
messages so you would get these messages

403
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:49,379
they would come in through whatsapp they

404
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:52,769
would say hey installed this new version

405
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:54,360
of whatsapp over at this at this Play

406
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:58,799
Store that is not actually the Play

407
00:18:54,360 --> 00:19:00,840
Store which given who was being targeted

408
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,000
was not that unusual

409
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:05,820
in the United States usually you see a

410
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:07,500
lot of a lot of criticism of this

411
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:10,379
particular attack vector and you say oh

412
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:13,710
who-who is going to use an unlicensed

413
00:19:10,379 --> 00:19:20,699
Play Store to which I usually say the

414
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:23,519
rest of the world so the phishing

415
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:26,429
message says go to go to this server

416
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:28,620
pull down a new copy of whatsapp in this

417
00:19:26,429 --> 00:19:32,179
particular case it was secure Android

418
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:32,178
dot info very secure

419
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:38,299
the other attack vector that we saw were

420
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:41,599
phishing messages so there would be a

421
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:43,279
Facebook group belonging to somebody

422
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:44,869
that they were targeting and I would say

423
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:48,709
everybody on this Facebook group

424
00:19:44,869 --> 00:19:52,158
go get your new updated whatsapp over

425
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:54,979
here on the phishing server or they

426
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:57,379
would just send like fake fake phishing

427
00:19:54,979 --> 00:20:01,489
messages in order to gather Facebook

428
00:19:57,379 --> 00:20:05,349
credentials and then all of these things

429
00:20:01,489 --> 00:20:05,349
work together it's the circle of life

430
00:20:05,709 --> 00:20:10,519
the other thing that we saw when we when

431
00:20:08,419 --> 00:20:14,329
we looked over the messages was physical

432
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:16,099
access so more than once we saw evidence

433
00:20:14,329 --> 00:20:19,279
that somebody had actually gotten ahold

434
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:20,958
of one of these phones and through

435
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:27,109
physical access had managed to install

436
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:30,190
the new trojan eyes dap location and the

437
00:20:27,109 --> 00:20:35,599
c2 server that was being used there was

438
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:37,459
android adobe dotnet so the how did we

439
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:40,399
know that physical access was being used

440
00:20:37,459 --> 00:20:44,239
we saw messages like this stuff that

441
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:46,039
says how are you and then a link and

442
00:20:44,239 --> 00:20:49,819
then you can download from here to

443
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:51,559
communicate better or hello i got my

444
00:20:49,819 --> 00:20:54,559
phone back please use this number for

445
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:56,899
text and phone thank you so obviously

446
00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:00,319
somebody had taken this victims phone

447
00:20:56,899 --> 00:21:02,178
installed the new trojan eyes to copy of

448
00:21:00,319 --> 00:21:08,799
whatsapp and then give them them their

449
00:21:02,179 --> 00:21:14,269
phone back so this is a screenshot of

450
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:18,319
secure android info my personal favorite

451
00:21:14,269 --> 00:21:19,369
part right here is quality is better

452
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:28,009
than the original

453
00:21:19,369 --> 00:21:29,359
i can't make this stuff up so one of the

454
00:21:28,009 --> 00:21:30,799
one of the things that we really saw

455
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:34,749
about the about the malware that was

456
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:38,658
being used in in this campaign was that

457
00:21:34,749 --> 00:21:41,899
it uses no exploits it is really common

458
00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:43,850
for for us to talk about state actors

459
00:21:41,899 --> 00:21:46,610
like they're extremely sophisticated

460
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:51,169
like they're sitting on a mountain of

461
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:53,570
O'Dea like they're magical wizards you

462
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:56,120
don't need to be a magical wizard it

463
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:57,409
turns out that you could just social

464
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:01,969
engineer and then copy and paste from

465
00:21:57,410 --> 00:22:03,500
Stack Overflow so they did in fact use a

466
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:06,130
bunch of copying and pasting from Stack

467
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:09,710
Overflow they use some c2 obfuscation

468
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:12,860
the exfiltration implementation totally

469
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:14,900
copied from Stack Overflow and they made

470
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:19,939
some really minor modifications to

471
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:22,100
publicly available code what's the most

472
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:23,570
important takeaway from this aside from

473
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,969
the it didn't seem to be extremely

474
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:28,340
competent work is that it does not have

475
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:31,580
to be extremely confident to competent

476
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:33,860
to be effective this stuff still worked

477
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:42,830
even though I would barely let these

478
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:44,120
guys pass like freshmen CS so what did

479
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:46,790
we find we found some interesting

480
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,139
connections to finfisher I don't know if

481
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:51,940
you guys remember finfisher but

482
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:55,190
finfisher is sort of fancy bespoke

483
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:56,600
surveillance we're not quite as fancy as

484
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:58,430
the sort of stuff you would find in five

485
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:03,310
eyes so like in the hundreds of

486
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:07,400
thousands low millions kind of range and

487
00:23:03,310 --> 00:23:08,690
so we found some stuff that we that did

488
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,870
not appear in previous dumps of

489
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:15,230
finfisher we found a bunch of mobile

490
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:18,139
endpoints and specifically we found

491
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:20,780
mobile endpoints with Kazakhstan's

492
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:24,680
calling code and a package compilation

493
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:29,300
time from around the same dates that we

494
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:30,910
were seeing operation manual going on

495
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:36,169
[Music]

496
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:45,299
meanwhile we also saw the sort of the

497
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:47,129
same attacks on desktops so the you

498
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:48,840
to understand that all of this Android

499
00:23:47,129 --> 00:23:53,459
stuff was extremely you know complicated

500
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:57,029
and getting getting through the desktop

501
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:58,799
bit was a little hard we discovered that

502
00:23:57,029 --> 00:24:00,659
they use to change zero day exploits

503
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,100
pivoting access off of compromised SCADA

504
00:24:00,659 --> 00:24:05,669
systems and we're using the blockchain

505
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:06,959
for exfiltration it was really really

506
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:09,029
complicated I'm not sure that I can

507
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:11,309
explain it to you oh wait it was fishing

508
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:13,350
it's always fishing there is never a

509
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:18,029
time when it is not fishing these people

510
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:19,379
were dumb as rocks so let's talk a

511
00:24:18,029 --> 00:24:21,029
little bit about the infection vectors

512
00:24:19,379 --> 00:24:23,459
that they were using for for their

513
00:24:21,029 --> 00:24:26,249
desktop malware they were using infected

514
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,600
documents which were fairly certain they

515
00:24:26,249 --> 00:24:29,999
were sending over email even though we

516
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,639
did not actually see the emails there

517
00:24:29,999 --> 00:24:35,789
were infected Word Excel Word Excel

518
00:24:32,639 --> 00:24:38,428
documents and PDFs they were taking

519
00:24:35,789 --> 00:24:40,320
advantage of macros if you are running

520
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:42,840
an environment that still has macros

521
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:46,109
turned on please for God's sake turn

522
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:48,418
that off and at one point they even

523
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:51,418
had an infected CHM file running

524
00:24:48,419 --> 00:24:55,529
PowerShell which I thought was extra

525
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:59,149
super weird but there it was and in fact

526
00:24:55,529 --> 00:25:02,070
here it is exciting

527
00:24:59,149 --> 00:25:05,580
so the desktop malware that they were

528
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:07,470
using was called bandook it was

529
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:09,149
originally observed as part of operation

530
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:11,909
manual and this is we found a new

531
00:25:09,149 --> 00:25:13,738
variant being used by dark caracal I

532
00:25:11,909 --> 00:25:18,379
have been told it is the Hindi word for

533
00:25:13,739 --> 00:25:24,389
gun and also Lebanese Arabic for bastard

534
00:25:18,379 --> 00:25:26,539
this this malware is modular it works on

535
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:29,100
Windows it's available for sale online

536
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:31,590
but the versions that we found appear to

537
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:34,259
be a private and early copy it's also

538
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:35,759
heavily obfuscated and it was found in

539
00:25:34,259 --> 00:25:37,409
Trojan as copies of a drawing program

540
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:38,789
and circumvention software

541
00:25:37,409 --> 00:25:42,059
psyphon which we talked about a little

542
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:47,399
bit earlier which we also saw being used

543
00:25:42,059 --> 00:25:49,619
in the mobile attacks all the MAL well

544
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:52,590
related windows api strings were

545
00:25:49,619 --> 00:25:54,169
encrypted and base64 encoded bandook

546
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:55,879
decrypts them at runtime

547
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:57,470
then the second stage is encrypted and

548
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,690
stored in a binary resource with an

549
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:01,580
eight character name the resource binary

550
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:03,890
is decrypted and injected into the AI

551
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:06,770
explorer.exe process using a technique

552
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:08,540
called process hollowing and the second

553
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:15,200
stage is packed with a custom version of

554
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:16,159
upx so boring here's the communication

555
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:21,080
with the c2s

556
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:24,020
again not super complicated more situ

557
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:25,699
communication exactly the same as the

558
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:30,170
palace mobile malware so we think maybe

559
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:31,790
these things are related and then here

560
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:33,650
are all the things that bad you can do

561
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:36,770
so you can capture the screen you can

562
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:40,340
get the Wi-Fi you can start a shell you

563
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:43,670
can get keys you can inject all kinds of

564
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:47,389
stuff so the usual sort of you know hey

565
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:50,060
I've got root on a on a desktop

566
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:52,400
we also found another malware family

567
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:55,070
which we call cross wrap so far we've

568
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:56,960
only seen dark Kara call use it version

569
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:59,450
point one was released in March of 2017

570
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:03,140
and limited features it's written in

571
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:06,080
Java which means cross-platform targets

572
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:09,080
it works in Windows OS 10 and Linux

573
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:10,639
I had no obligation and no packing it

574
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:17,060
installs itself for persistence and

575
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:19,790
again no exploits fancy this is clearly

576
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:23,810
a picture of the of the hacker doing his

577
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:26,720
hacking thing again a communication with

578
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:35,179
the situ is over plaintext TCP super

579
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:39,020
super simple and it looks like this now

580
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:41,900
I mentioned earlier that we we found the

581
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:45,350
dark Kara call c2s and the first thing

582
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:48,110
that my genius coworker asked was hey

583
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:49,639
you don't think that they were as stupid

584
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:51,199
this time as they were the previous time

585
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:54,350
and left all their directories open do

586
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:58,370
you answer was yes and boy did we

587
00:27:54,350 --> 00:28:00,330
exfiltrate a whole lot of data I'm here

588
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:03,419
to tell you about this data

589
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:06,030
all right so the first thing that we did

590
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:10,140
was we geo-located all the compromised

591
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:12,270
devices and we found that they were

592
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:15,630
located all over the world you may see

593
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:20,010
that there's sort of a bit of a cluster

594
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:21,800
in in the Middle East but we also see

595
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:26,730
several in the United States and Canada

596
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:28,409
not to be left out this is the split of

597
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:32,850
the exfiltrated content on their Dobby

598
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:35,760
air net one of the one of the c2s as you

599
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:38,699
can see about half windows a half

600
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,860
Android most of the most recent stuff

601
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:43,650
was coming in on Android which is

602
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:47,939
consistent with our experience of them

603
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:51,960
sort of moving more heavily into into

604
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:55,950
mobile all right I don't even know what

605
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:57,500
this is here we go so we pulled a whole

606
00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:01,350
bunch of stuff we pulled desktops

607
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:03,840
screenshots Skype logs and DB's personal

608
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:06,149
photos iPhone backups like an entire

609
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,340
iPhone backup unencrypted that that took

610
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:10,710
forever to get through corporate and

611
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:16,379
legal documentation all kinds of extra

612
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:18,000
super sensitive stuff and these are

613
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,680
examples of the kind of messages that we

614
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,750
were seeing which includes stuff like

615
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:28,230
bank routing numbers which are redacted

616
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:30,060
here because I'm not a jerk this is an

617
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:33,050
overview of the exfiltrated data from

618
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:36,620
the Android campaigns as you can see we

619
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:41,010
we had about a quarter million files

620
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:46,949
about half a million texts mostly in

621
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:51,660
Arabic we had about 1,500 authentication

622
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:54,870
accounts I and about 200,000 unique

623
00:29:51,660 --> 00:30:00,330
Wi-Fi SSIDs pay close attention this

624
00:29:54,870 --> 00:30:02,489
will be on the test later so as you can

625
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:04,679
see this is the infrastructure there's a

626
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:08,040
bunch of the domains that they were

627
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:13,250
using this stuff would also be useful

628
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:13,250
later again Adobe AIR net shows up

629
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:18,230
do we care about Adobe AIR net one of

630
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:21,379
the interesting things that we learned

631
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:24,529
was that all of the c2c to is being used

632
00:30:21,379 --> 00:30:28,399
by this particular actor were Windows

633
00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:30,799
machines which is extremely unusual in

634
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:36,529
this space usually CC to s running Linux

635
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:39,259
I and furthermore they were running a

636
00:30:36,529 --> 00:30:43,639
very particular set of services which

637
00:30:39,259 --> 00:30:45,619
allowed us to fingerprint them it's

638
00:30:43,639 --> 00:30:49,820
almost as if they were using Clippy to

639
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:51,918
set up their C twos so we take a closer

640
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:58,639
look at Adobe AIR yet we can see that it

641
00:30:51,919 --> 00:31:01,220
was the the fingerprint included XA MPP

642
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:02,090
for Windows five point six point three

643
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:04,429
one

644
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:09,408
Apache two point four point two six

645
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:11,899
maria DB 1.00 sorry ten point one point

646
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:13,700
two five etc etc the whole idea is like

647
00:31:11,899 --> 00:31:15,320
this is a very particular fingerprint

648
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:19,399
there aren't a lot of machines running

649
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:24,200
this particular set of services that

650
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:27,379
made them really easy to find as you can

651
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:28,940
also see they they ran some very

652
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:32,418
interesting domains they ran some

653
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:35,210
domains that were made to look like like

654
00:31:32,419 --> 00:31:36,879
Twitter here's there pretty good mock-up

655
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:40,009
of the Twitter login page

656
00:31:36,879 --> 00:31:45,590
here's there pretty good mock-up of the

657
00:31:40,009 --> 00:31:46,970
facebook login page and as you can see

658
00:31:45,590 --> 00:31:49,759
this is one of the Facebook groups that

659
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:53,330
they were using to spread all of their

660
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:55,070
links the other fishing domains included

661
00:31:53,330 --> 00:31:58,100
a Facebook services dot org gmail

662
00:31:55,070 --> 00:32:01,700
services org Twitter Twite her I guess

663
00:31:58,100 --> 00:32:04,119
only one T the English language has

664
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:06,980
bizarre Spelling's dot-org

665
00:32:04,119 --> 00:32:12,860
all these domains have been sinc hold

666
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:14,210
because we are not stupid meanwhile we

667
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:16,189
went ahead and we took a look at the c2

668
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:18,080
servers we found control panels for

669
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:20,809
multiple campaigns using various malware

670
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:22,580
that included Irish rat bandook and our

671
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:25,850
comrade and we found these servers

672
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:26,710
hosting exfiltrated desktop content so

673
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:29,289
much

674
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:32,100
traded desktop content seriously please

675
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:36,429
stop taking selfies

676
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:38,610
this shows the HTTP 200 okay response

677
00:32:36,429 --> 00:32:40,659
codes for the server and the payload

678
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:42,549
each of the directories contained a

679
00:32:40,659 --> 00:32:45,159
login panel for a different rep so many

680
00:32:42,549 --> 00:32:48,010
many many different rats sitting on

681
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:50,289
these sea toons who was behind all this

682
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:53,710
so we went ahead and we started with the

683
00:32:50,289 --> 00:32:56,140
first email address which was used to

684
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:57,730
register the domains and it was op 13

685
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:59,320
male com

686
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:02,190
this was sort of key to linking a whole

687
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:05,200
bunch of the infrastructure together the

688
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:07,029
sort of dark era called group was using

689
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:09,669
a number of different personas including

690
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:12,390
Nancy Razoo Kisan Ward Hajji Meza and

691
00:33:09,669 --> 00:33:12,390
Rami jabber

692
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:20,529
Nancy brazuca is is an actual journalist

693
00:33:17,309 --> 00:33:21,970
the phone number that she used is our

694
00:33:20,529 --> 00:33:25,649
the phone number which is associated

695
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:28,870
with her is an actual phone number in

696
00:33:25,649 --> 00:33:30,729
Lebanon and it belongs to somebody who's

697
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:37,330
really tired of security researchers

698
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:39,760
calling them Hadi masa is another one of

699
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:44,500
the identities that was used to register

700
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:48,070
all of these domains rami jabber

701
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:52,510
registered the domain arab live news.com

702
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:54,639
eye and the Whois address information is

703
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:57,279
in close proximity to where we had seen

704
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,929
that test devices we haven't quite

705
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:02,860
gotten around to where all of this stuff

706
00:33:58,929 --> 00:34:04,570
is so you may have gotten the idea from

707
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:07,360
a lot of the personas that are being

708
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:09,609
used that somebody is really interested

709
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:12,609
in the middle east and somebody is super

710
00:34:09,609 --> 00:34:13,869
interested on spying people or spying on

711
00:34:12,609 --> 00:34:16,330
people in the Middle East and

712
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:20,470
particularly spying on their desktops

713
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:22,869
and their cell phones but where are

714
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:24,339
these people because people all over the

715
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:25,419
world are interested in spying on the

716
00:34:24,339 --> 00:34:30,869
Middle East it's just an interesting

717
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:33,339
place where in the world is dark carico

718
00:34:30,869 --> 00:34:36,560
we started with

719
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:39,149
[Music]

720
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,609
trying to sort of narrow things down so

721
00:34:39,149 --> 00:34:47,638
here's the whole world and then we

722
00:34:41,609 --> 00:34:50,310
started with some SS ideas and the way

723
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:54,060
that we got them was this so we went

724
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:57,060
ahead and we pulled all of the all of

725
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:58,950
the GPS data from the SS IDs that were

726
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:03,029
associated with the infected phones and

727
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:05,490
we got two clusters one appeared to be a

728
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:10,770
cluster of victims but the other looked

729
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:16,470
like a cluster of test devices so where

730
00:35:10,770 --> 00:35:18,780
are all the tests device is located here

731
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:21,419
we go this is the SSID there's the MAC

732
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:25,740
address here we go they're all located

733
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:31,290
on one Street and very root Lebanon now

734
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:32,848
anybody who has ever tried to use GPS in

735
00:35:31,290 --> 00:35:36,680
order to navigate their way across the

736
00:35:32,849 --> 00:35:39,300
city knows that GPS is not 100% accurate

737
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:43,410
which is why you have this whole sort of

738
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:46,710
spread of blue dots and so in the

739
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:49,710
interest of figuring out exactly where

740
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:52,770
are these test devices are all located I

741
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:55,950
sent someone to Beirut the copy of

742
00:35:52,770 --> 00:35:58,050
waggle looking for the SSID is in

743
00:35:55,950 --> 00:36:00,839
question and in this particular case the

744
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:10,640
SSID that they were looking for was BL

745
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:13,500
d3 f6 or building 3 floor 6 where is it

746
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,598
it's right here it's this orange

747
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:17,160
building what does this orange building

748
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,839
do for one thing we're fairly certain

749
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,790
it's this orange building because notice

750
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:23,069
it is the only building for quite the

751
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:27,839
ways around that even has the right

752
00:36:23,069 --> 00:36:29,940
number of floors and as it turns out

753
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,500
there's a big label on the front of the

754
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,060
building that tells us exactly who it is

755
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,300
and it's the general directorate of

756
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:37,440
general security of lebanon in beirut

757
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:39,510
just basically they're equivalent to the

758
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,080
CIA and the FBI because why keep them

759
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:45,720
separate you can do it all at once

760
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:48,150
so we can't tell you that the actor

761
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:49,410
behind dark Caracol is the Lebanese

762
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:51,570
government we can't even tell you that

763
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:53,640
it's the gdgs we can however tell you

764
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:59,240
that the call is coming from inside the

765
00:36:53,640 --> 00:37:01,589
house what can we learn from all this

766
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:05,549
the first thing is the cyber warfare is

767
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:09,440
getting cheaper what we're seeing here

768
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:12,690
is an actor that is not really using

769
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:15,570
premium products anymore in fact their

770
00:37:12,690 --> 00:37:17,940
third it looks like they started by

771
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:19,020
calling finfisher and maybe using a few

772
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:21,120
of their products and then they're like

773
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:22,680
this is all very complicated how about

774
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:26,759
if instead of that we could just use

775
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:29,250
this series of portals being being used

776
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:32,190
by an administrator in this one building

777
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:34,380
in Beirut you can also see that they

778
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:39,180
have moved to mobile as a primary attack

779
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:42,240
vector I and also that if you use very

780
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:45,210
common SI toos and sort of off-the-shelf

781
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,279
malware that it enables you to hide in

782
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:50,790
the noise of misattribution for many

783
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:53,880
years they suspect nothing

784
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:57,420
so one of the other things that we can

785
00:37:53,880 --> 00:38:01,850
learn from this is it leaves us with

786
00:37:57,420 --> 00:38:05,580
sort of a mystery why would these people

787
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:08,970
who are spying on enemies of the

788
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:11,640
government of Kazakhstan also be located

789
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:12,930
in this building in Beirut and be spying

790
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,879
on all of these people who are

791
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:22,339
interesting to the government of Lebanon

792
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:25,640
I have a theory and my theory is that

793
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:29,070
what we're looking at is a third party a

794
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:33,240
third party that is selling a portal to

795
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:36,330
various governments so if you cheap out

796
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:38,279
and you decide that that finfisher is

797
00:38:36,330 --> 00:38:40,770
too expensive and a hacking team is too

798
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:44,430
expensive and the NSO group is too rich

799
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:46,320
for your blood if as when you read

800
00:38:44,430 --> 00:38:48,509
through the hacking team emails you

801
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,000
discover that using these products is

802
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:52,930
actually kind of complicated and if you

803
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:57,010
want TechSoup

804
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:59,259
you need people who speak English or who

805
00:38:57,010 --> 00:39:00,970
you know have some sort of technical

806
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:03,490
background if you don't have all of that

807
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:05,950
going for you and you just want some

808
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:09,339
like monkey to sit at a computer and

809
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:13,540
push buttons in order to do spying then

810
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:15,880
you hire these guys and we're fairly

811
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:18,310
certain that that they sold to both

812
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:21,760
Lebanon and Kazakhstan and furthermore

813
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:23,650
that they still exist what has happened

814
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,510
in the years since this report was

815
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:28,030
published we have a couple of updates

816
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:30,700
the first is that Major General abbas

817
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:35,320
Ibrahim the director general of the gdgs

818
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:36,939
read our report and he said the general

819
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:39,430
security does not have these type of

820
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:42,070
capabilities we wish we had these kind

821
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:43,750
of capabilities then an official source

822
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:46,180
in the public security told

823
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:47,770
al-akhbar the paper that the director

824
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:49,779
has the ability to spy on any other

825
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:51,490
device in the world but we wish we had a

826
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:53,770
small part in the capabilities that the

827
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:55,540
report attributes to us the source added

828
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:57,580
that this report was part of a political

829
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:59,470
campaign aimed at public security

830
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:01,330
because of its role in protecting

831
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:05,259
Lebanese security from Israeli

832
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:08,590
incursions so basically watch out I am a

833
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:11,820
tool of the Zionist regime and finally

834
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:17,320
my my beloved building three floor six

835
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:19,480
SSID was in fact finally taken down so

836
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:21,760
whoever's inside the building is now

837
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:23,620
using a different SSID or maybe even

838
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:30,160
running his portals out of someplace

839
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:32,350
else if you're interested in in learning

840
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,879
more about dark Caracalla as an actor or

841
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:36,790
operation manual as an actor the

842
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:43,870
research reports are available at these

843
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:47,980
fine URLs and normally this is the part

844
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:51,480
where I tell you about how important it

845
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:54,330
is that people do this kind of research

846
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:57,250
because if you do this kind of research

847
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:59,950
it's it's not very it's not very

848
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:03,010
sophisticated it's not very sexy it's

849
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:04,629
actually kind of tedious but it is

850
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:07,210
the stuff that allows us to speak truth

851
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:08,890
to power this is the stuff that keeps

852
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:13,120
governments from getting away with

853
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:17,910
spying on activists and journalists from

854
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:22,120
you know kidnapping and firebombing

855
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:26,200
dissidents from spying on scientists as

856
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:30,490
they did using NSO groups

857
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:32,200
Pegasus malware in Mexico as well as the

858
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:36,250
people who are in charge of finding out

859
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:40,270
what happened to dozens of of missing

860
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:43,210
and murdered students this stuff is

861
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:46,360
really important and people who are

862
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:48,640
working at security companies and at AV

863
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,900
companies are not necessarily going to

864
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:53,339
make this kind of research their

865
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:58,000
priority because journalists and

866
00:41:53,340 --> 00:42:02,760
activists don't buy fancy threat feeds

867
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:05,470
they don't buy expensive reports and

868
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:09,010
they're never going to be your bread and

869
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:10,720
butter you know you can't you can't

870
00:42:09,010 --> 00:42:15,160
build a business off of this kind of

871
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:18,040
research but if this is the work that

872
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:19,960
you do it is extremely important to make

873
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:22,930
it public because it is for the public

874
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:26,110
good and you are the people the people

875
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:28,240
in this room who have the knowledge and

876
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:30,160
the resources to make that happen

877
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:34,509
because you work for companies or

878
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:36,609
governments or platforms that have the

879
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:39,460
telemetry that let you see when these

880
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:42,940
kind of abuses are happening and it is

881
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:45,460
on you to speak up when you see this

882
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:47,800
kind of misuse when you see journalists

883
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:50,710
being targeted or when you see activists

884
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:52,240
being targeted because honestly nobody

885
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:56,140
else is going to do it

886
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:59,529
I there's a reason why these kinds of

887
00:42:56,140 --> 00:43:03,609
reports get published by EF f citizen

888
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:05,500
lab maybe the occasional University

889
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:07,480
you know once or twice you'll see you

890
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,890
something come out of like because first

891
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:11,050
you your CrowdStrike

892
00:43:08,890 --> 00:43:15,129
but for the most part not a lot of

893
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:15,990
people do this work and we need help

894
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:17,790
because

895
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:20,700
I can't do it alone it's extremely

896
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:22,200
tiring and honestly most of the people

897
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,710
in this room are probably better at it

898
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,480
than I am

899
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:29,550
I had to tweet this morning because ffs

900
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:33,270
virustotal a sort of professional

901
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:35,940
account it has expired and now we need

902
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:37,530
to pay our bills so now I need somebody

903
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:40,410
to provide me with with an

904
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:42,440
enterprise-level VT account ask me what

905
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:46,879
kind of fancy

906
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:51,540
Intel I'm doing with no virustotal

907
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:53,840
enterprise account not a whole lot so

908
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:56,190
this work is hard and we need your help

909
00:43:53,840 --> 00:44:01,650
the other point that I wanted to make is

910
00:43:56,190 --> 00:44:04,050
that what you do matters a lot of people

911
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:05,160
are coming here with their resumes and

912
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:06,710
they want somebody to review their

913
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:10,500
resumes I will be doing reserve a

914
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:14,820
tomorrow people are coming here looking

915
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:18,630
for jobs and the InfoSec industry pays

916
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:20,900
really well you have a very particular

917
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:22,950
set of skills

918
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:25,830
but the people who are willing to pay

919
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:27,569
you the most money for those skills do

920
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:29,490
not want you to rescue kittens from

921
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:31,530
trees if they're willing to pay you that

922
00:44:29,490 --> 00:44:33,990
much money they probably want you to do

923
00:44:31,530 --> 00:44:36,150
something bad and I want you to think

924
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:37,410
about the work that you do every day and

925
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:40,080
the choices that you make when you're

926
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:43,399
trying to decide which job you're going

927
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:46,620
to take you don't have to help

928
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:49,020
facilitate human rights abuses and in

929
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:55,140
fact if you do just imagine me standing

930
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:58,230
here judging you if that helps and if

931
00:44:55,140 --> 00:45:00,150
enough people get up and say we're not

932
00:44:58,230 --> 00:45:02,310
going to facilitate human rights abuses

933
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:05,130
we're not going to work for the Finn

934
00:45:02,310 --> 00:45:07,770
fishers and the hacking teams and the

935
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:10,200
gamma groups and the NSO groups and the

936
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:14,730
black cubes of the world then we can

937
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:18,240
really make a difference i and if we

938
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:19,950
take those jobs and then we say if if I

939
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:22,589
don't do it somebody else is going to do

940
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:26,669
it let it be somebody else

941
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:28,140
don't make human rights abuses easier

942
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:31,440
for governments

943
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:33,900
to carry out don't carry their water for

944
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,660
them don't do their work for them make

945
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:40,590
them work really hard to find somebody

946
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:44,190
to do their evil deeds because it's

947
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:48,480
really important that InfoSec have some

948
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:51,450
ethics it's really when we take computer

949
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:54,540
science classes before we even learn how

950
00:45:51,450 --> 00:45:56,730
to write hello world we should take an

951
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:58,020
ethics class and that's something that

952
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:59,610
doesn't happen in computer science

953
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:01,380
departments all over the world instead

954
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:03,750
we sort of pride ourselves on being the

955
00:46:01,380 --> 00:46:05,460
people who break the rules the people to

956
00:46:03,750 --> 00:46:10,470
whom laws don't particularly matter

957
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:13,020
we are the Mavericks of the world but

958
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:15,299
ethics are extremely important and you

959
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:18,560
are powerful in ways that I think you

960
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:21,630
don't necessarily appreciate right now

961
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:41,880
and we absolutely cannot do it without

962
00:46:21,630 --> 00:46:43,140
you thank you very much questions you

963
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:47,790
will be there at the black hat or DEF

964
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:51,569
CON EFS desk so last year we had ethics

965
00:46:47,790 --> 00:46:54,710
village in DEFCON I was not in the

966
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:54,710
ethics village because I was drinking

967
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:02,220
but you should have ethics absolutely

968
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:04,109
yeah I am I am very excited about the

969
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:07,049
advent of the ethics village and I've

970
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:11,190
been going to a DEFCON 4

971
00:47:07,050 --> 00:47:14,250
Oh God since 1999 so it was the dawn of

972
00:47:11,190 --> 00:47:20,700
time dinosaurs were roaming the Alexis

973
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:23,610
Park and and there I was if you have the

974
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:25,140
opportunity please come to DEFCON and if

975
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:29,540
you do happen to come to DEFCON every

976
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:32,160
year the FF does an ask AFF panel where

977
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:34,050
about half a dozen of us get up on stage

978
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:34,470
and you can ask us whatever you whatever

979
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:35,210
you want

980
00:47:34,470 --> 00:47:39,879
so

981
00:47:35,210 --> 00:47:45,200
like this only with lawyers so having

982
00:47:39,880 --> 00:47:47,089
ethics in place before we start learning

983
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:49,009
programming is a very powerful message

984
00:47:47,089 --> 00:47:52,040
that you have given so I being part of

985
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:54,290
nul community we look into it how we can

986
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:55,808
work on it okay and I will report you

987
00:47:54,290 --> 00:47:57,529
back when we meet in Def Con this year

988
00:47:55,809 --> 00:47:58,970
fantastic

989
00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:03,470
friends do you have any questions we

990
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:05,480
have seven more minutes I have answered

991
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:14,689
all the questions I'm just that good

992
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:17,030
yeah all right oh there are so many ways

993
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:19,190
in which you can contribute to uff so my

994
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:22,700
favorite way is to buy stickers and the

995
00:48:19,190 --> 00:48:26,089
t-shirts the cool t-shirts they have so

996

world we are a membership driven

998
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:33,410
organization the people who are our

999
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:35,780
members are the people who pay my rent

1000
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:40,129
and I think that's extremely important

1001
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:42,589
as does my landlord and one of the ways

1002
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:44,510
in which you can join us is you can just

1003

1006
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:52,009
important thing that uff does if you

1007

want to get really ambitious we will

1008

send you a hoodie which is extreme a

1009
00:48:55,670 --> 00:49:01,130
very basic piece of clothing that you

1010
00:48:58,309 --> 00:49:04,900

1011

hoodie we give you like it's required

blog posts about all of the issues that

1018
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:25,640
we think are important on the Internet

1019
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:30,440
you can also go to our Action Center

1020

where we have people fill out all kinds

1021
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:34,609
of requests to various people in

1022
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,710
government this is where we yell at

1023
00:49:34,609 --> 00:49:40,460
companies this is where we yell at the

1024
00:49:36,710 --> 00:49:42,020
FTC and and other people in power and

1025
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:45,060
sometimes yelling at people in power is

1026
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:48,080
the way to make activism happen so

1027
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:50,759
you two can be this this person so

1028
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:52,860
supporting AFF is not just about money

1029
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:56,580
there are all kinds of other things you

1030
00:49:52,860 --> 00:49:59,430
can do and I understand that not

1031
00:49:56,580 --> 00:50:00,480
everybody has tons and tons of money but

1032
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:02,370
the people who don't have tons and tons

1033
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,680
of money have at least a little bit of

1034
00:50:02,370 --> 00:50:05,910
time and if you have that time you can

1035
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:07,279
read our website and stay up to date on

1036
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:21,359
our issues

1037
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:22,800
any more questions yeah yeah why I'm

1038
00:50:21,360 --> 00:50:24,030
sure everybody in the room heard about

1039
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:28,500
what's happening with encryption in

1040
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:31,140
Australia yes right have you had any

1041
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:33,780
people talking to EFS about that people

1042
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:35,640
who work as developers in other

1043
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:39,990
countries and how should they deal with

1044
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:42,299
it yes so as a quick bit of background

1045
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:43,859
for what is happening with encryption

1046
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:48,590
all over the world usually this is an

1047
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:52,740
entire 40 45 minute long talk but the

1048
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:54,810
the to long don't read is that in the

1049
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:57,060
United States the FBI has been

1050
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:59,279
complaining about what it calls going

1051
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:00,720
dark much like this screen over here and

1052
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:03,210
they say that people are using

1053
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:05,240
end-to-end encryption messengers to send

1054
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:08,760
information to each other and their and

1055
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:11,609
because they cannot decrypt the contents

1056
00:51:08,760 --> 00:51:14,640
of these messages the the FBI is not

1057
00:51:11,610 --> 00:51:16,410
able to solve crimes you can tell that

1058
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:19,770
this is really genuine because clearly

1059
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:22,049
all criminal activity criminal finding

1060
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:25,710
but activity by the FBI has ground to a

1061
00:51:22,050 --> 00:51:27,030
halt over the years so every once in a

1062
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:29,520
while the American government says this

1063
00:51:27,030 --> 00:51:32,030
and then PFF has to rise up and kill

1064
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:34,740
this bad idea

1065
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:37,520
meanwhile other countries have also

1066
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:40,350
decided that this is a great idea so

1067
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:43,350
Russia has passed a law requiring

1068
00:51:40,350 --> 00:51:46,890
companies to to backdoor there and and

1069
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:48,750
commit encrypted communications but the

1070
00:51:46,890 --> 00:51:51,390
only way in which they can really exert

1071
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:52,950
pressure is with companies based in

1072
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:55,770
Russia and then it turns out that the

1073
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:58,098
number of companies offering end-to-end

1074
00:51:55,770 --> 00:52:01,779
encrypted communication services based

1075
00:51:58,099 --> 00:52:08,299
out of Russia is in the sort of zeros

1076
00:52:01,779 --> 00:52:10,039
surprise same for China but other

1077
00:52:08,299 --> 00:52:12,619
countries have decided to get in on the

1078
00:52:10,039 --> 00:52:16,670
game so a couple years ago the British

1079
00:52:12,619 --> 00:52:18,380
past the Investigatory Powers Act which

1080
00:52:16,670 --> 00:52:21,710
gives the British government the power

1081
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:23,839
to secretly order a company that does

1082
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:27,200
business in the UK that has I think more

1083
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:30,259
than thirty thousand British users to

1084
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:32,569
secretly backwards and and encrypted

1085
00:52:30,259 --> 00:52:33,769
services in order to allow them to spy

1086
00:52:32,569 --> 00:52:37,579
on somebody that they think has done

1087
00:52:33,769 --> 00:52:42,140
something bad I and the same thing has

1088
00:52:37,579 --> 00:52:43,460
recently passed in Australia and so now

1089
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:46,759
one of the things that we're really

1090
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:49,690
concerned about is that the Australian

1091
00:52:46,759 --> 00:52:52,220
and British governments are going to

1092
00:52:49,690 --> 00:52:53,569
these large companies that provide

1093
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:57,009
end-to-end encrypted services and

1094
00:52:53,569 --> 00:53:00,349
forcing them to secretly backdoor their

1095
00:52:57,009 --> 00:53:03,619
their products I and gagging them so

1096
00:53:00,349 --> 00:53:05,239
that we will never know about it this is

1097
00:53:03,619 --> 00:53:07,369
extremely worrisome this is actually one

1098
00:53:05,239 --> 00:53:09,920
of the reasons why my my colleague Anna

1099
00:53:07,369 --> 00:53:13,579
Cardozo recently left EF F and went to

1100
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:15,890
go work for Facebook which I will never

1101
00:53:13,579 --> 00:53:19,569
stop making fun of him about I and it's

1102
00:53:15,890 --> 00:53:22,670
largely because he's concerned that the

1103
00:53:19,569 --> 00:53:24,529
the British and Australian governments

1104
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:27,769
are going to exert this kind of pressure

1105
00:53:24,529 --> 00:53:30,410
on on whatsapp and whatsapp is used by

1106
00:53:27,769 --> 00:53:32,629
like two billion people so if you can

1107
00:53:30,410 --> 00:53:35,960
protect the integrity of whatsapp you

1108
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:38,210
can do a lot of good in the world this

1109
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:40,249
is also one of the reasons why I

1110
00:53:38,210 --> 00:53:42,319
encourage people to use signal and why

1111
00:53:40,249 --> 00:53:45,499
the existence of signal in the ecosystem

1112
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:47,960
is so important because signal is open

1113
00:53:45,499 --> 00:53:50,479
source and so you can actually check all

1114
00:53:47,960 --> 00:53:55,369
of the code I mean most of us won't and

1115
00:53:50,479 --> 00:53:58,879
most of us are not you know PhDs in

1116
00:53:55,369 --> 00:54:01,190
cryptography but but we could and that's

1117
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:03,019
the important thing so if there are any

1118
00:54:01,190 --> 00:54:06,499
changes they will immediately be

1119
00:54:03,019 --> 00:54:10,009
detected and there will be much gnashing

1120
00:54:06,499 --> 00:54:13,910
of teeth and tearing of hair

1121
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:15,350
is it does that cover enough of we've

1122
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:18,410
spent a lot of time thinking about this

1123
00:54:15,350 --> 00:54:20,540
and being very angry about it I wrote a

1124
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:33,589
bunch of things to the British and the

1125
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:36,740
Australian government well I would start

1126
00:54:33,590 --> 00:54:45,109
by pulling all of my servers and

1127
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:46,669
employees out of Australia one of the

1128
00:54:45,109 --> 00:54:48,290
ways in which I would push back on this

1129
00:54:46,670 --> 00:54:50,060
sort of thing and India's say well how

1130
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:52,310
do you feel about companies pulling all

1131
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:53,779
their people out of your country you

1132
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:55,880
want technology in your country

1133
00:54:53,780 --> 00:54:59,240
presumably because it's going to employ

1134
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:02,450
a bunch of Indians if you want servers

1135
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:05,629
if you want jobs you can't require

1136
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:08,180
people to secretly backdoor encryption

1137
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:10,130
because nobody will put their servers in

1138
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:11,299
your country and nobody will employ

1139
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:13,750
people in your country because they're

1140
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:13,750
not trustworthy

1141
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:26,950
anybody else so we have lost one minute

1142
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:26,950
very last question wants to do it yes

1143
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:36,170
ladies and gentlemen the Electronic

1144
00:55:32,869 --> 00:55:38,330
Frontier Foundation is hiring currently

1145

developers so lots of interesting stuff

1149
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:53,660
in the in the mix but if you keep an eye

1150
00:55:48,020 --> 00:55:55,220
out on our on the jobs page at WWE ffor

1151
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:57,049
you will see that we've always got like
