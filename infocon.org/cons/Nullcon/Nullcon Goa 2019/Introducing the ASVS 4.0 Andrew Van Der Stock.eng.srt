1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:10,290
okay folks obviously it's so that it's a

2
00:00:07,979 --> 00:00:12,120
session after lunchtime and so I'll try

3
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,639
to keep you entertained as we go through

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,290
the food coma together my name is Andrew

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:18,210
vana stock I am a senior principal

6
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:21,090
consultant at synopsis I look after the

7
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:23,490
managed services area which means that

8
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:26,220
from the point of view of technical

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,919
things so quality the checklists and

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:32,700
you'll see the reason why I check

11
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:35,790
I have been at most since 2002 and late

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:39,780
2002 I wasn't there at the very very

13
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:42,180
beginning but I know who was the reality

14
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,650
is is that I've done a lot of things for

15
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,690
hours over the years it's probably too

16
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:47,940
much to mention now if I got 45 minutes

17
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,099
the main ones of note is the I was top

18
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,220
ten we recently released the OS top ten

19
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:58,800
2017 and I'm going to convince you not

20
00:00:53,220 --> 00:01:00,030
to use it okay so let's get going so

21
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,489
what is the application security

22
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,790
verification standard unlike the OWASP

23
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:09,810
top 10 it's an actual standard you can

24
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:11,579
actually comply with it now being a

25
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,350
standard will actually mean that it's

26
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:15,839
one of those areas that we're trying to

27
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:17,999
move towards generally accepted security

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,810
practices those things that should

29
00:01:17,999 --> 00:01:24,030
become the norm not necessarily those

30
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:25,740
things that have been traditionally done

31
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,389
and we're going to talk about those as

32
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,089
we go through the different controls for

33
00:01:27,389 --> 00:01:33,149
example in authentication we're going to

34
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:36,450
talk about password rotation and my

35
00:01:33,149 --> 00:01:38,039
opinions on that so fundamentally as we

36
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:41,130
go through that you'll see that we've

37
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:42,409
actually adopted a lot of things the

38
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:44,189
size of the checklist is now

39
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:46,590
considerably bigger than it used to be

40
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:48,089
and so it's important for you to realize

41
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,039
you don't have to do the entire thing

42
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,109
you can pick and choose what you want

43
00:01:50,039 --> 00:01:55,009
okay so we've got some great things

44
00:01:52,109 --> 00:01:57,958
coming up it is community and it is

45
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:59,609
industry driven industry in that we

46
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:01,859
basically do like to hear from the

47
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:04,529
people who are actively using the ASVs

48
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:07,048
every day and in fact in the 2.0 release

49
00:02:04,529 --> 00:02:09,269
we found out that the one of the tax

50
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:12,870
officers from a European company country

51
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:14,730
was actually using the ASVs for all of

52
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,620
their application security efforts and

53
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:18,018
we extraordinaire

54
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,310
happy about that and in fact those folks

55
00:02:18,019 --> 00:02:21,709
have actually contributed things like

56
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:23,750
the Web Services chapter so this is an

57
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:25,970
example of where it was a bi-directional

58
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:28,160
feedback we gave them some checklists

59
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:30,650
they gave us some checklist back and it

60
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:34,190
made the entire thing better it's

61
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:37,489
completely open at github now I promised

62
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:41,590
that we would release the ASVs 4.0 on

63
00:02:37,489 --> 00:02:41,590
stage so let's go ahead and do that

64
00:02:50,880 --> 00:03:00,140
okay when this happens the ASVs will be

65
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,140
published on github okay

66
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:05,540
gotta know how to use github

67
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:20,100
okay once that's done ASVs

68
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:25,950
is launched so you can get it too

69
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:28,859
while we're doing this talk so now

70
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:30,989
you've seen the power of publishing in

71
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:32,490
the open and in fact for the last week

72
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:33,570
or so you could have seen a very close

73
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:35,190
to final version you could have

74
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,890
generated yourself you could have

75
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:39,630
started working with it yourself we do

76
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:41,130
rely upon people to review and whatnot

77
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,450
so we'll talk about that in a check what

78
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,640
does it actually look like it looks like

79
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:46,829
this this is just a sampling of controls

80
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,230
you can see there this is the beginning

81
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:53,040
of the authentication chapter and we

82
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:55,200
actually have some controls here such as

83
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,370
verified the user set passwords are at

84
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:02,579
least 12 characters in length now we did

85
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:04,620
try to align with NIST 863 and we've

86
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:07,710
done a lot in that area unfortunately

87
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,720
their advice was for 8 characters but 8

88
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:12,240
characters we can now run through all

89
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:18,000
eight character passwords in 2.5 hours

90
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:20,630
for ntlm so no known not 8 so if you're

91
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,710
doing single factor authentication is 12

92
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:24,240
fundamentally this is one of those areas

93
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,460
that we have to keep on moving and

94
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,350
pushing people forward we are a leading

95
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,810
edge standard version 2 was even

96
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:33,419
difficult for people to do so who's

97
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:36,900
involved my number one person involved

98
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:39,570
is you I want you to review I want you

99
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:41,489
to contribute I want you to think about

100
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:44,130
what it is if there's something that's

101
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:46,050
not able to be complied with if there is

102
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:50,159
something that is actually too difficult

103
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:53,040
to use on a regular basis submit a

104
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,700
ticket we'll get it fixed we're

105
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,220
committing now to doing point releases

106
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:02,430
maybe every three to six months to fix

107
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:04,380
up those little tiny bugs the next major

108
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:08,250
release will probably be in around 2 to

109
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:11,280
3 years time ok so this had to be

110
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:14,460
looking forward to 2022

111
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,049
and so we're pushing the envelope you'll

112
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,359
see things in here that you may not be

113
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:22,290
familiar with and that is okay because

114
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:24,870
by 2022 it will not be unfamiliar we've

115
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:26,750
had some amazing reviewers Ella Leung

116
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:29,970
asama

117
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:32,790
Rossi Sonam el-naggar Ron Perez Hana

118
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:35,430
Miko sandy Serge Bell Colin Jason

119
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:39,290
actually Adam Gordo these guys between

120
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:41,760
them submitted over 200 tickets and an

121
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:43,680
amazing amount of work went into some

122
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,380
very careful thought went into what they

123
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,410
wanted and in fact with Allah and Osama

124
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:51,540
we actually had replacement verification

125
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,980
text which was one a much better so this

126
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:55,740
is the power of that can mean that

127
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,780
community-driven spirit so think about

128
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,300
how many times do people here have to

129
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:05,190
comply with something like ISO 27000 and

130
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:07,860
- yeah you know that went through a

131
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:09,300
committee and the committee kept on

132
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,780
watering it down and down and down until

133
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,790
everyone agreed yeah we actually in the

134
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:17,309
ASVs we have conceptual integrity we

135
00:06:14,790 --> 00:06:19,620
want to be the best web app and web

136
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,310
service standard there is bar none no

137
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,530
excuses

138
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,700
we don't water things down sometimes

139
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,270
we're a little aggressive and that's

140
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:30,060
okay because we're open you can forecast

141
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:32,520
and you can make it your own so what's

142
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,410
new quite a lot we basically have

143
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:35,940
completely transferred into markdown

144
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:38,039
this is really good

145
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:40,680
not only does it help with translations

146
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:43,560
so say for example there's currently an

147
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,080
effort to translate this into Hindi once

148
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,900
that Hindi translation is done they can

149
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,580
then track any changes that we make we

150
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,770
might make one or two character changes

151
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:55,620
here and there we might make a paragraph

152
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:57,539
here or there with github we can

153
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:59,340
actually give them the complete list of

154
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:01,409
what changed since they last translated

155
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:03,330
and now and that will speed up their

156
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:08,039
translation effort by orders of

157
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:11,340
magnitude also because it's translatable

158
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:13,650
we will then find out from coming back

159
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:15,840
from translations was it hard to

160
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:17,429
translate and if it's hard to translate

161
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,349
it's probably difficult in English as

162
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:21,360
well and we can make it a simpler thing

163
00:07:19,349 --> 00:07:24,150
that's when it's really good

164
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,340
nice 863 I've got inside coming up on

165
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:28,318
that I won't talk about it now we also

166
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:30,750
have the Internet of Things preview

167
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,879
chapter this was going to be built into

168
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:35,639
the ASVs but we decided that our focus

169
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:39,080
had to be web apps and web services what

170
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,409
we want to do is create an ecosystems of

171
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:43,650
thing

172
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:46,770
verification standards that leverages us

173
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:49,258
as a base level and then taking out all

174
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:51,568
the duplicate controls and the part

175
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:54,060
that's interesting to them like mobile

176
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:57,020
or IOT will be a much smaller guide and

177
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:59,400
therefore we can actually leverage that

178
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:02,128
one of the other things that I'm just

179
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:04,258
going to mention about 863 we went

180
00:08:02,129 --> 00:08:07,669
another way to make it easy for people

181
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:11,819
who are doing ISO 27000 and to PCI DSS

182
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:15,659
3.2.1 and I all stop ten to comply with

183
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:18,539
us we don't have competing strategies in

184
00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:20,520
this state hundred s63 we are absolutely

185
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:22,830
aligned we're a little in excess of

186
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,409
where they are but the reality is is

187
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:29,128
that all the other ones are catching up

188
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:33,718
to NIST 863 an ISO 27000 and to the next

189
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:36,149
generation will catch up so we do deal

190
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:38,310
with modern web apps last 3.01

191
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:41,130
we did have support for responsive web

192
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:42,869
apps and some api's but it was difficult

193
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,850
for those applications to really

194
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,980
translate it through we now have full

195
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:49,470
support for service and responsive web

196
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:52,490
applications we also talked about the

197
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:54,449
idea that there is no server-side

198
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,680
architecture anymore it's really

199
00:08:54,449 --> 00:08:57,599
important to understand that we've gone

200
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:00,899
through and weeded out all of those

201
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,660
areas that assume that you own a server

202
00:09:00,899 --> 00:09:06,149
in a data center that's yours we've

203
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:08,100
taken that constraint it out okay you

204
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:13,850
still can make secure software in that

205
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:18,290
way we have completed the cwe mapping

206
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:21,000
cwe is a problem we are a controls based

207
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:23,519
standard these are the things we want

208
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:25,320
you to do the weaknesses in numeration

209
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,320
is that a list of everything that could

210
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:31,350
go bad but not really it's missing about

211
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,270
in our case roughly around 15 to 20

212
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:36,540
percent of the fun of the issues that we

213
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:39,060
have have no corresponding cwe and in

214
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,740
fact even this morning when I noticed

215
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:43,739
there was a mistake in one of these

216
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:46,290
chapters I had to go back and read that

217
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,180
there was two different cwe's both of

218
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:51,480
them were relevant i had to interpret

219
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:54,689
the differences between cwe 94 and CWA

220
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:59,490
one one six and in the end I went to CWA

221
00:09:54,690 --> 00:10:02,279
159 these are very closely overlapping

222
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:05,010
and it's no wonder we have troubles when

223
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:07,380
people align their tools to CWA and say

224
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:10,079
we want you to do see it of Yui well yes

225
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:13,709
we do cwe but it's our best guess as to

226
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:15,390
the best match hopefully by setting down

227
00:10:13,709 --> 00:10:17,910
a standard like this we can start to get

228
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:20,550
the tool vendors on board with our

229
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:21,810
desired mapping which means we may be

230
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,959
wrong but everyone's going to be the

231
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:27,660
wrong the same way so I would suggest

232
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,729
let's help CWA out it's a volunteer

233
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,709
driven thing you can submit new cwe's

234
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:34,079
and there's a process to get published

235
00:10:31,709 --> 00:10:37,349
we can help in both establishing new

236
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,790
cwe's but also helping in the editing do

237
00:10:37,350 --> 00:10:42,540
you reach out to our colleagues at mitre

238
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:44,040
and see what we can do for them what's

239
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:45,689
changed everything we renumber

240
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,699
completely if you have a previous

241
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:50,010
version for ASVs there is no one to one

242
00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:51,959
mapping and in fact finding the previous

243
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:54,149
items may be tricky because we reword it

244
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:56,160
a great deal of them the reason why we

245
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:58,470
had to do that is that we had gaps we

246
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,380
deliberately design gaps into one two or

247
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:03,269
three so that people who had pen tests

248
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:06,660
done in 2009 can compare them against

249
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:08,430
pen tests done in 2017 okay when we

250
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,829
retired controls we didn't reuse its

251
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:13,109
number the reality is is that we had so

252
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:15,420
many numbers that as soon as we realized

253
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:17,399
that we were hitting dock 50 in a couple

254
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:20,910
of the chapters and we previously told

255
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:22,769
people forecasts make your controls dot

256
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,238
50 in above we'll never get there well

257
00:11:22,769 --> 00:11:26,039
we got there is through

258
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:28,049
so we had to renumber in a different way

259
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:30,449
and once we started down that process it

260
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:32,639
made no sense whatsoever to keep the

261
00:11:30,449 --> 00:11:36,348
previous numbering so this gives us a

262
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:38,699
lot of headroom and you'll see from here

263
00:11:36,349 --> 00:11:41,459
it's three levels

264
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:45,209
so even it'll take us a long time to

265
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:50,098
exhaust all of those 640 K is enough for

266
00:11:45,209 --> 00:11:51,809
everyone right okay we deduct this means

267
00:11:50,099 --> 00:11:53,789
that in the past you might have been

268
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:56,819
able to use the API chapter and just the

269
00:11:53,789 --> 00:11:58,919
API chapter and that's yet no we've

270
00:11:56,819 --> 00:12:01,289
really gone to town and if it has the

271
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:03,629
same cwe number as something in another

272
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:05,279
section and they belong in that

273
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:07,739
different section it's where it's gone

274
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:09,720
so a lot of API Finn ocation is now in

275
00:12:07,739 --> 00:12:13,019
the authentication chapter you have to

276
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:16,079
use all of the chapters l1 is the new

277
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:18,239
minimum the our top 10 is the beginning

278
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,709
checklist for everybody it's where you

279
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:21,599
start your application security journey

280
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:24,029
as I've wrote in the foreword to the

281
00:12:21,599 --> 00:12:26,539
2007 edition it is an awareness piece

282
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:28,939
that is not a standard then PCI DSS

283
00:12:26,539 --> 00:12:31,679
immediately included us into the PCI DSS

284
00:12:28,939 --> 00:12:33,868
standard so you can sort of see where

285
00:12:31,679 --> 00:12:35,728
things start to go wrong it is not

286
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:36,899
sufficient you can still get hacked the

287
00:12:35,729 --> 00:12:38,249
breaches that we've had over the last

288
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:40,619
three or four years have been

289
00:12:38,249 --> 00:12:43,729
tremendously large and it is a failure

290
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:46,799
of the industry to help folks build

291
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:48,329
secure software we can't patch our way

292
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,728
out of this we need to build secure

293
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:52,199
software so level one we deliberately

294
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:55,529
decided to do this it was actually a

295
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:57,358
difficult decision because level one now

296
00:12:55,529 --> 00:12:59,459
has a hundred and sixty seven things in

297
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:01,769
it and so if you think from a pen test

298
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:04,559
list that has 167 things what do I do

299
00:13:01,769 --> 00:13:06,269
well time box your efforts the reality

300
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:07,769
is is that not all of them are equal you

301
00:13:06,269 --> 00:13:09,869
don't have to do all of them if you

302
00:13:07,769 --> 00:13:12,749
don't have JWT the JWT section does not

303
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:15,029
apply to you but level one is

304
00:13:12,749 --> 00:13:16,739
deliberately pen testable every single

305
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:17,789
one of those controls you can get in

306
00:13:16,739 --> 00:13:19,889
there and do a black box

307
00:13:17,789 --> 00:13:21,959
we highly recommend against doing

308
00:13:19,889 --> 00:13:24,779
penetration testing says the person who

309
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:27,029
looks after penetration testers a lot of

310
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:28,499
them we've got to get to a place where

311
00:13:27,029 --> 00:13:31,529
and I'd love to be able to do this

312
00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:33,959
hybrid code reviews essentially you do a

313
00:13:31,529 --> 00:13:35,450
pen test that's led by code you can then

314
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:36,800
concede the assumption

315
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:39,160
that are made in the code you can find

316
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,319
things you'd never find using SiC

317
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,060
automatic scanners I would like to get

318
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,620
to a place where automatic scanners

319
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,719
you're running them as part of your CI

320
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:50,660
CD process and therefore there is no

321
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:53,150
point in actually making level one any

322
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:56,240
less than what we have I would like to

323
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:59,120
see people if they have an SSR F problem

324
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:02,480
to be able to identify an SSR F problem

325
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,600
because it is in level one okay give

326
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,640
them the code let them find it give them

327
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,160
a non production database so they can

328
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,020
absolutely hammer the application and

329
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:15,199
get it done

330
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:19,280
hybrid reviews at least I've talked

331
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:21,380
about that we forget PCI DSS 6.5

332
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,360
compliance we've had to add back memory

333
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:24,590
controls such as buffer overflows and

334
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,750
integer overflows and all those

335
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:28,730
wonderful things about four or five of

336
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:31,160
them and what this means is that before

337
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:33,320
the ASVs was good for nine out of the

338
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,810
ten things in Section 6.5 we're now good

339
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,910
for all ten and so we're going to work

340
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:40,400
with PCI DSS I would really like them to

341
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:43,430
replace that section with a reference to

342
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:45,350
us and then for them to identify the

343
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:46,489
controls that they truly care about in

344
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:49,340
relation to the payments industry

345
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:53,000
because they are controls it's not a

346
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:54,770
weakness okay so that's the discussion

347
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,870
for the future that just released a new

348
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:58,490
guide we referenced it as a reference we

349
00:14:56,870 --> 00:15:00,920
don't it was released too late for us to

350
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:02,870
include any real references to it what's

351
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,270
gone we got rid of a bunch of less

352
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:06,370
impactful controls for example I went

353
00:15:05,270 --> 00:15:08,180
through the Google's

354
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:09,740
the Google has a vulnerability

355
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,959
management program that you can actually

356
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:14,000
submit bugs through bug bounties and get

357
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,200
paid you know one thousand three hundred

358
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,580
and thirty seven dollars if you find

359
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:19,730
something interesting or a lot of money

360
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:20,990
if you find a like sandbox bypass they

361
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,120
have a list of rules of things they

362
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:24,380
don't accept I went through that list

363
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,680
and I agreed with most of them so

364
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:29,420
eliminated them from the ISPs okay we no

365
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:32,420
longer look for things and headers that

366
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:34,910
you cannot get you hacked it's really

367
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:38,719
important that we actually did that make

368
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:40,250
for emphasis it up us since when okay v1

369
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,860
architecture got completely rewritten

370
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:45,740
all the things that we're architectural

371
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:46,750
related in the previous versions are now

372
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:49,020
in the architecture

373
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,950
and what this means is that these are

374
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,750
encompassing things that you have to

375
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,970
build him from scratch these are the

376
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:57,130
things that if you had to do it after

377
00:15:54,970 --> 00:15:59,290
the fact you were never going to do it

378
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:02,530
you're going to rewrite the software so

379
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:05,579
there's not many of them but it's an

380
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:07,870
important section the first item I think

381
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:09,400
now that I've published it you might

382
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:11,410
know what it beers what you're from the

383
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:16,150
first item of the secure security

384
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:18,250
architecture chapter is what's the basis

385
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:22,180
for producing secure software what do

386
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:26,470
you need to be able to do that you need

387
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:29,410
a secure SDLC item number one one point

388
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:31,740
one point one of the ASVs 4.0 is you

389
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:34,240
must have a nested a secure a still see

390
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:35,650
it's a prerequisite you cannot produce

391
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,260
secure software without it we've

392
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:41,100
demanded we don't care which one you use

393
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:43,120
just pick one and go for it we also

394
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:45,640
require threat modeling that's the

395
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,830
second control now these are level two

396
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:49,689
controls pen tests you can't do this as

397
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:51,760
a pen test it's a level two control you

398
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:54,250
need to work with the developers we also

399
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,870
require people to design and document

400
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:58,480
their decisions we don't necessarily

401
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:01,089
want you know big default sign up front

402
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,610
what we are expecting is as you build

403
00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:05,860
the software confluence or other wiki's

404
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:10,390
contain the information about your

405
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:13,599
product okay authentication I'll give

406
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:17,140
you a little story does anyone know how

407
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:19,569
password rotation came about I've told

408
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:22,740
the story a few times so apologies if

409
00:17:19,569 --> 00:17:25,659
you've heard it before in 1978 and 1979

410
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:29,100
two researchers by the name of Morris

411
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:32,590
and Kernighan you might know the names

412
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:35,110
used a pdp-8 at night time and on

413
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:38,139
weekends in single user mode to crack

414
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:40,750
dares unsalted passwords and they're

415
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:43,030
able to do it in 31 days for around 40%

416
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,470
of the passwords this is in the days

417
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:49,090
that you could actually have passwords

418
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:51,430
like ABC now they came up with an

419
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:54,159
arranger controls including using

420
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:57,260
one-way hashing and salting the

421
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,900
passwords mm-hmm

422
00:17:57,260 --> 00:18:02,270
okay that eventually came around it took

423
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:04,160
bsd what another nine or ten years

424
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:07,220
before it was part of the base operating

425
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,770
system but guess what was one of the

426
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:11,420
recommendations they put in there that

427
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:14,690
they just said does not work and you

428
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:16,370
should not do its rotate the passwords

429
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,490
and they said you know if you're going

430
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:20,379
to do it you have to do it every 30 days

431
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:23,570
for a pdp-8

432
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:25,670
you know my mobile phone is billions of

433
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:27,649
times faster than PDPA you cannot change

434
00:18:25,670 --> 00:18:30,140
your password fast enough and even that

435
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:32,510
the algorithm they use des they weren't

436
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:36,470
even aware of the shortcut that gets rid

437
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:38,270
of half of all dares challenges and if

438
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:40,190
they'd known that it would have taken

439
00:18:38,270 --> 00:18:41,990
them 15 days and then it would have

440
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:45,590
become obvious the password rotation

441
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:46,670
does not work and yet I bet how many

442
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:50,780
people here have to change their

443
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:54,110
password every 90 days oK we've got to

444
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:58,040
stop doing it if nist 800 s63 says you

445
00:18:54,110 --> 00:19:01,340
don't do it at all it's prohibited we

446
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:04,280
say it's prohibited as is password

447
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:06,970
complexity we substitute multi-factor

448
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:10,820
authentication and longer passwords

449
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:15,500
we also mandate that the application

450
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:17,810
must allow password managers I have 460

451
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,760
unique passwords they are all 20-plus

452
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:22,570
characters long and less the site does

453
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:25,610
not allow me to have like long passwords

454
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:27,409
we basically say that you're not

455
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:29,719
compliant with the ISPs if you don't

456
00:19:27,410 --> 00:19:33,890
have those basics because we know that

457
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:35,660
the Forbes article two days ago 74% of

458
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:37,850
all of the breaches in the last year

459
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:40,340
came from credentials that have been

460
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:44,600
published and credential stuffing is now

461
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:47,240
the major attack on most web apps okay

462
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:49,699
we can no longer afford to ignore the

463
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:51,260
reality that passwords day are done we

464
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:53,720
need to get to a place where you cannot

465
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:55,460
crack them you cannot recover them you

466
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,770
store them correctly and you have

467
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:59,000
multi-factor authentication but the

468
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:01,250
other ones that we have is we've

469
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,290
actually said that use Fido support NIST

470
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:06,260
has this as well we want to make sure

471
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:07,570
that if a if a person has a multi-factor

472
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,790
token and

473
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:12,189
possible to reuse that token reuse that

474
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:14,980
token there's I mean I have three on me

475
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:17,650
right now you know not Fido tokens but

476
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:19,600
tokens in general and then for example

477
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:25,090
on my phone which is around here

478
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:29,230
somewhere I'll find it later it has

479
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:31,419
eight or nine soft tokens there should

480
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:35,500
be a possibility of reusing the tokens

481
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:37,660
and without that possibility they

482
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:41,380
multi-factor becomes really untenable if

483
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:44,230
you have 460 tokens or 460 accounts it's

484
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:46,420
not going to work session management we

485
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:48,340
now deal with JWT we deal with all the

486
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:51,730
different versions of API authentication

487
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:54,639
including SEM L we have cookie based and

488
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:56,650
all the wonderful things we document a

489
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:59,080
Newton attack that's being actively used

490
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:01,300
out in the financial services land the

491
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:04,750
fight it is a half-open attack it uses a

492
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:08,560
pattern where when you start to reset a

493
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:11,530
password or you start to do the forget

494
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:14,889
username password it brings in the

495
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:17,110
complete user profile and then the clot

496
00:21:14,890 --> 00:21:20,380
the attacker force browsers to

497
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:22,030
authenticated functionality such as set

498
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:24,160
a password or set deep out their

499
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,420
questions and answers and because that's

500
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,930
actually used during the registration

501
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:32,440
process it may not verify that you are

502
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:35,290
logged in and so this actually happened

503
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:41,950
against two Canadian banks and one very

504
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:44,500
large credit agency and it works because

505
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:47,080
the pattern is the profile is loaded

506
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,210
from disk and this functionality allows

507
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,970
you to change that password unchanged

508
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:54,070
those questions and answers okay the

509
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:55,810
information is there so with the

510
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:57,550
attackers called this the half-open

511
00:21:55,810 --> 00:22:01,570
attack and that's what we've called it

512
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:04,629
as well access control by the way longer

513
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:06,460
timeouts up to 30 days ok it just

514
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:08,620
reflects the reality that if you're

515
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:12,280
using LinkedIn on your mobile phone the

516
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:13,510
the the days of shared computers are

517
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:16,240
gone

518
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:18,280
people do use their mobile phones

519
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,740
without to stay logged in forever so

520
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,690
every time that we did a code review

521
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:24,460
underneath ASVs 3.01

522
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:27,550
and you didn't walk them out in within

523
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:29,650
15 minutes you failed but that's not

524
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:32,950
realistic it needs to be per the risk

525
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:35,170
now the risk is very high it's still 15

526
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:37,570
minutes but at the low end of the scale

527
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:41,140
you can now pass with up to a 30-day

528
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:43,030
Berra token so after 30 days you should

529
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:45,310
ask for the password again and with

530
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:49,870
modern phones again and stand to worry

531
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:52,409
me about where mine is with modern

532
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:56,679
phones it is coming to the place where

533
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:58,090
it is you know you can reassign ik 8 in

534
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:01,570
a half a second just by using your

535
00:22:58,090 --> 00:23:03,760
thumbprint or using your face access

536
00:23:01,570 --> 00:23:05,740
control we deal with it it's not much

537
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,810
different now we just cover server with

538
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:09,700
some cloud access controls we've made it

539
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:11,350
really clear that access control is

540
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,600
about protecting data and we've got a

541
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:18,159
good section on data protection coming

542
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:21,310
up this got a huge revamp we've deduct

543
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:23,170
there's fewer items in overall but we

544
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:26,950
actually have added 8 extra funds

545
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:29,140
including SSR F D serialization xxe and

546
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:30,880
a few others now 301 did actually

547
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,710
mention xxe but didn't tell you how to

548
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:34,780
do it properly this time we actually

549
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:36,010
have separate items for it we also have

550
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:39,820
JavaScript injection

551
00:23:36,010 --> 00:23:41,920
so not just eval but also template

552
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:44,050
injection and all sorts of wonderful

553
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:46,240
things so if you're doing CSP bypasses

554
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:49,210
using angular or anything like that the

555
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:52,480
reality is we now have controls to help

556
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:55,360
you get there third cryptography the

557
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,570
main difference is that we actually ask

558
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:01,330
you to data classify you don't want to

559
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:03,460
encrypt everything algorithm agility

560
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:05,590
there is going to be a time when shaft 3

561
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,790
will probably be not good enough and

562
00:24:05,590 --> 00:24:08,949
we'll have to do something about it I

563
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:11,379
want you to be able to move secret

564
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:13,330
management we finally do acknowledge the

565
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:16,150
existence of hardware security modules

566
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:18,310
TPMS and others and in fact we would

567
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:20,560
like you to use ours key stores over and

568
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:22,240
above say for example the java key store

569
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:24,700
but java key stores still better than

570
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,200
clear text passwords and config files so

571
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:29,950
we want you to manage your secrets of

572
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:32,860
better error handling we no longer ask

573
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:34,600
you to report on stack traces please

574
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:36,490
stop doing that unless there's something

575
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,080
about a person in the stack trace it's

576
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:40,360
not important you're not going to get

577
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,340
hacked they might work out what we're in

578
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:44,560
the file system you are but it's not

579
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,360
gonna be good enough so it's about

580
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:48,040
reducing the time to detect breaches

581
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,899
it's about making sure that you've got

582
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,760
sufficient logging and auditing and

583
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:55,180
escalation in place to be able to reduce

584
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:58,570
that time last year's varus on had it

585
00:24:55,180 --> 00:25:00,130
it's still a tad over half a year I

586
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:03,189
believe it's gone down a little bit this

587
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:06,130
year but it's still way too long in half

588
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:08,140
a year you can extract a lot of data and

589
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:11,080
a lot of the really interesting breaches

590
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:14,050
are actors who don't release that

591
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:17,590
information so they're putting it out

592
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:19,990
there data protection now covers gdpr

593
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:21,820
it also covers things like the

594
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:23,320
Australian privacy principles and others

595
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:25,960
that have technical controls associated

596
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:28,330
with them we basically deal with the

597
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:30,820
concept of not just data disclosure but

598
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:33,850
unauthorized modification creation and

599
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:35,290
deletion because in the past we may not

600
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:37,480
have made that it sufficiently clear

601
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:41,290
that a it's about humans and B it's

602
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:43,210
basically around ensuring that for

603
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:45,850
example you cannot update someone's

604
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:49,440
medicines you cannot then for example

605
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:54,010
change someone's salary or force them to

606
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:55,990
retire if it's a HR system we need these

607
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:58,000
protections in there not just out of

608
00:25:55,990 --> 00:26:00,160
disclosure people think about privacy

609
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,560
breaches as this is this many records on

610
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,540
the internet but imagine if you're a

611
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:06,700
health insurer and someone's twiddled

612
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:08,500
with your data just ever so little and

613
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,780
you've got hundreds of millions of

614
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,940
records what could you trust you would

615
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:15,160
have to go back to a backup and actually

616
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,920
do a data cleanse could be months before

617
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,730
you're back on the job

618
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,710
communications security we've got a

619
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:22,410
complete rewrite we don't want

620
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:25,180
developers thinking about how to do

621
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:26,800
chain-like by letting the certificate

622
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:28,630
chain that's an operating system problem

623
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,460
if there's a problem with the

624
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:33,130
certificate handling in the operating

625
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:34,840
system that's not a developer issue we

626
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:36,580
don't want you to log that the

627
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:39,280
certificate was no good

628
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:43,330
we do want to go to a place where we

629
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:46,120
have everything TLS or encrypted the

630
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:48,189
days of the you know interior network

631
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,989
you can connect to it via telnet and the

632
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:52,000
database connection is unencrypted those

633
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:55,270
days have been done for years we are

634
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,800
making it part of the actual ASVs now we

635
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:59,139
want you to use modern configuration

636
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,820
builders so say for example if you are

637
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:02,980
doing TLS configuration we're not going

638
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:05,020
to give you what to do we're saying go

639
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:06,610
to somewhere like the mozilla SSL

640
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:09,430
configurator and build a good

641
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:12,310
configuration and then test it with SSL

642
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:16,930
labs ok if you can nee + out of that

643
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:19,179
your job done good work and you know in

644
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:21,010
Amazon if you're using the EOB just use

645
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:23,620
the latest profile that satisfies that

646
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:26,740
requirement okay so we don't ask

647
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:28,689
developers to do things they can't do in

648
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:30,730
malicious code we gave it a good solid

649
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:33,870
rework we want to basically get to a

650
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:37,450
place where things like privacy invading

651
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:39,129
libraries are taking care of that wasn't

652
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:41,470
part of the malicious code section

653
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:44,740
before and because it was level 3 in the

654
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:47,380
past people never did it we want people

655
00:27:44,740 --> 00:27:49,630
to start searching for backdoors time

656
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:52,980
bombs and permission invading libraries

657
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:55,450
are probably the most common that's an

658
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:59,080
amazing problem on the Android platform

659
00:27:55,450 --> 00:28:00,880
at the moment business logic

660
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,860
verification got a great deal of update

661
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,400
we really went to town on this one we

662
00:28:02,860 --> 00:28:07,510
wanted to make sure that the usual sorts

663
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:11,830
of things how many people's favorite

664
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:14,160
filmers office space ok I have the red

665
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:17,230
stapler that's how bad in tragic I am

666
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:19,530
office space has a salami attack built

667
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:23,500
into it that's the premise of the movie

668
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:25,000
so we deal with salami attacks we've

669
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,460
always dealt with a salami attack but

670
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,070
the reality is we want you to do as well

671
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:31,660
and so you've got to be able to do it in

672
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:33,280
step order you've got to be able to do

673
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,230
in a human time and there should be

674
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:37,149
business limits not just technical

675
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:39,280
limits like you can call this API 50

676
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:40,900
times what happens if you do 50

677
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,120
transactions are three million dollars

678
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:44,650
apiece you know that's no good it really

679
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,290
comes down to the combination of

680
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:48,720
velocity plus impact we want you to

681
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:53,158
think about those things

682
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:56,580
and finally about five or six years ago

683
00:28:53,159 --> 00:29:01,260
I came across the first NIST publication

684
00:28:56,580 --> 00:29:02,939
from 1976 it was classified for a time

685
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:06,330
because it taught people how to secure

686
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:11,159
software it had the equivalent of the OS

687
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:13,918
top ten in there in 1976 and 8 out of

688
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:19,260
the 11 things that are there are in the

689
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:21,210
OWASP top 10 okay one of the ones that

690
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:23,640
wasn't in the oils top 10 is race

691
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:26,039
conditions but what do we have today

692
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:29,159
that those guys didn't have back then

693
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:31,679
that they thought so far ahead they were

694
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:35,070
doing batch serially on mainframes with

695
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:37,860
tapes if they were doing a sort that was

696
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:39,720
basically tape to tape sorting you know

697
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:41,969
we're talking about that sort of a time

698
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:43,860
as very serial those guys thought about

699
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:46,980
distributed computing and race

700
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:49,049
conditions before it was a thing we now

701
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:51,870
have laptops like this one that have 8

702
00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:53,549
cores you know if you look at a modern

703
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:57,059
server you're looking at 70 something

704
00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:59,250
cause if you then put nodejs on it it

705
00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:01,500
pretends to be single threaded it's

706
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:03,299
absolutely not single threaded it's

707
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:05,039
really important that we know that Java

708
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:06,990
and some of our major frameworks are

709
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:08,908
multi-threaded by default and that we

710
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:10,919
take care of it we've put that back in

711
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:15,030
actually we put it in for the first time

712
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:16,770
that's going to be hard we talk about it

713
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:18,030
in terms of shared state we will work on

714
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:19,470
that in the future versions but

715
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:22,100
fundamentally if you've got shared state

716
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:25,230
and multi-threading you've got a problem

717
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:27,059
files and resources is the next one we

718
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:28,740
gave it a bit of a revamp we basically

719
00:30:27,059 --> 00:30:30,990
wanted to make it easier to comply with

720
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:33,840
too many times files and resources it

721
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:35,190
just mentioned L Fi and RFI and didn't

722
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,049
tell you what to do about those things

723
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:38,940
we now tell you what to do about them we

724
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:41,700
split them out a little bit we also

725
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:43,590
talked about SS RF in some detail we

726
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:45,720
also talked about dtt processing and

727
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:48,750
other things so it makes it a lot better

728
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:51,900
and is much easier to comply with from a

729
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:54,000
developer point of view API security

730
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:56,220
total revamp we threw the old one out we

731
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,679
got rid of a g2 and we basically made a

732
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,490
restful section a slope section a no

733
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:01,049
graph QL

734
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:03,000
in which we've also called web service

735
00:31:01,049 --> 00:31:06,418
data layers because graph QL will not be

736
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,970
the first or the last web service data

737
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:11,340
layer okay it's a very important

738
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:13,020
technology for those doing react but

739
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:15,178
there are other technologies other than

740
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:17,490
react and things like graph QL will

741
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:19,559
continue to come up and for those who've

742
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:22,520
not dealt with graph QL before think

743
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:25,549
about web based data based queries

744
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:28,289
you've basically at select star from

745
00:31:25,549 --> 00:31:30,149
built in from an API you can call and

746
00:31:28,289 --> 00:31:32,760
you can think about all the security

747
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:34,860
problems we've always had with that it's

748
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,270
back again and so what we need to do

749
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:40,229
here is actually get to a place where

750
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:41,908
graph QL is safe and the last chapter

751
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:44,640
that's in the ASVs

752
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:47,070
is configuration we've changed this

753
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:49,320
around so that it's got far fewer items

754
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:51,928
that make no difference and it's got far

755
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:53,850
more items that make a huge impact for

756
00:31:51,929 --> 00:31:56,880
example the first one is we want you to

757
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:58,980
have a repeatable build process we want

758
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,990
you to do the configuration as part of

759
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:04,500
your build that way you can deploy a

760
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:06,690
development system and a UAT system and

761
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:10,140
a versus B system and a production

762
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:11,580
system in a few seconds and it's secure

763
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:13,490
by default because it's the same

764
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:16,439
controls in each of those environments

765
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:18,330
we also talked about sandboxing we also

766
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:19,590
talked about dependency checks we want

767
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:20,850
you to use dependency checkers to

768
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:22,580
actually make sure that you don't go

769
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:24,600
live with vulnerable components and

770
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:26,760
lastly one of the things that's in bug

771
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,039
bounties it's a huge payout for lots of

772
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:31,710
folks right now is subdomain takeovers

773
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:34,379
we finally have a sectional subdomain

774
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:36,270
takeover so if you use cloud based

775
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,399
services and don't control the DNS

776
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:40,230
someone else can come in behind you and

777
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:43,500
take over that watch what comes through

778
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:46,919
and then potentially takeover systems I

779
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:49,380
have a friend who does that and well

780
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:51,570
anyway let's just say that one of the

781
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:53,490
programs he does is he a frequent flyer

782
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:54,720
program and every time he wants to fly

783
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:56,299
somewhere he hacks them a little bit

784
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,460
more with the subdomain takeover and

785
00:32:56,299 --> 00:33:00,899
gets a fair number of points and keeps

786
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:02,669
on doing it until he has actually got

787
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:06,570
enough points to fly where he wants to

788
00:33:02,669 --> 00:33:08,370
go so I'm it's a common thing in bug

789
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:10,750
bounties it's not very common in pen

790
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:14,419
testing I'd like you to get used to it

791
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:16,429
okay I mean how do I use it well there's

792
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:19,040
so many different ways when we start at

793
00:33:16,429 --> 00:33:21,080
the ASVs about ten years ago it was

794
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:23,270
originally the secure coding checklist

795
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:24,770
at aspect security plus some other

796
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:27,170
things that might be burski brought in

797
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:28,910
Mike and Jeff Williams and Dave Ricker's

798
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:31,160
they built this entire thing and they

799
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:33,320
donated it at the community they did

800
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:34,520
hold some things back such as the shared

801
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,919
memory staff and distributed computing

802
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,929
stuff because even back then aspect was

803
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:42,280
you know quite advanced you know fair

804
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:45,740
warning I did work for them at the time

805
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:47,270
since then we've gone past just secure

806
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:50,300
code review you can use it for pen

807
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:52,160
testing you can use it for agile you can

808
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,659
actually use it for constraints DevOps

809
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,420
you can actually use it as a benchmark

810
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:59,929
for your tools how many of the level one

811
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:02,059
can your tool detect yeah so you can now

812
00:33:59,929 --> 00:34:03,650
objectively measure that you can also

813
00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:05,570
use it for things like deployment

814
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:08,389
checklists and saying for example I have

815
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:11,360
I built a test or a hardening for this

816
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:12,770
thing and when you're doing planning

817
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,200
Sprint's how many people here have seen

818
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:19,399
ours cornucopia or the Microsoft

819
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:22,699
elevation of privilege game personally

820
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:27,489
none okay if you're in agile how many

821
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:30,980
people do agile work a few of you good

822
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:34,520
agile folks basically had this concept

823
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:36,139
if you ain't gonna need it now what that

824
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,879
meant to them is they ain't gonna need

825
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:39,080
documentation so stop doing that

826
00:34:37,879 --> 00:34:40,759
you ain't gonna need architecture

827
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,529
because we do it every sprint you ain't

828
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:44,840
gonna need what and you just wrote I

829
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:46,609
actually managed to catch up with one of

830
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:48,889
the guys who actually founded the agile

831
00:34:46,609 --> 00:34:50,449
manifesto and they're never many they

832
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:53,060
never meant to get rid of these things

833
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:54,379
because you are gonna need it but they

834
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:56,659
weren't very specific about what they

835
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:59,150
weren't gonna need and people just went

836
00:34:56,659 --> 00:35:01,430
too far so the enterprise architecture

837
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:04,820
function has disappeared in most agile

838
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:06,649
works workplaces and that's so just

839
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:08,060
that's a shame because I mean at the end

840
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:11,240
of the day if you have a single well

841
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:12,680
honed authentication piece everything

842
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:14,919
that uses that doesn't have to do with

843
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,940
dedication and it just works so

844
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:18,950
enterprise architecture can more than

845
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:22,130
pay for itself and it's sad that it's

846
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:25,970
gone with

847
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:31,460
prints frame-up sprint planning the idea

848
00:35:25,970 --> 00:35:33,259
is is that we can actually young threat

849
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:35,810
modeling should be there if it's not

850
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:37,130
it's one of those areas like I had a

851
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:40,520
limited number of things I can put on

852
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:43,460
the slide um it needs to be there you

853
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:46,550
can use the other this would you need to

854
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:48,950
follow consecutive practice yeah it's

855
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:52,270
the second item in the ice fears so it

856
00:35:48,950 --> 00:35:56,120
modeling is the second item okay cool

857
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:58,009
okay so there's two ways I have told you

858
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,480
that level one has a hundred and sixty

859
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:02,540
something controls and that may be way

860
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:05,150
too much for you grab it or kit delete

861
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:08,779
the things you don't care about make

862
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:11,780
your own version of level one if for

863
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:13,010
example you're a bank and you find the

864
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:14,720
things that are in level three that

865
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:17,600
apply to you but you don't want to do

866
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:19,399
level three Orca delete the things you

867
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:20,660
don't want out of level three and then

868
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:22,610
put the things that are still in level

869
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:24,589
three into level to make it your own

870
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:26,990
I want you to do that it's designed to

871
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:28,940
be customized any way you want the

872
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:30,589
actual PDF that I generated this morning

873
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,750
you can generate yourself you can make

874
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:34,250
your own version it's got a CSV

875
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:37,460
generator so for the people who have

876
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:39,590
tools you can now grab the CSV that

877
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:42,010
contains the exact text the exact thing

878
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:44,000
the exact cwe and import it directly

879
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:46,250
okay so you can make your own version

880
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,190
and then export it into your favorite

881
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:52,280
thing straight away deep standards have

882
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:54,260
no bounds use it the way you want you

883
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:57,410
may want to use it as by default I'm

884
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:59,900
happy for that too how to get involved

885
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:01,670
as an OS project we're open source we

886
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:03,830
want you to get involved at the very

887
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:05,270
least we need translations if you speak

888
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:07,190
a different language other than English

889
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:10,520
please contact us we have a process for

890
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:14,150
doing that it's very straightforward it

891
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:16,640
just takes a long time two to four weeks

892
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:18,800
worth of effort depending on how fast

893
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:21,609
you can type we need more case studies

894
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,680
if you actually use the ASVs we want to

895
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:26,540
put the case studies into the wiki and

896
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:28,509
keep them up to date how do people

897
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:31,430
actually use the ASVs in real life

898
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:32,750
create issues or if you notice something

899
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:33,899
and you want to fix it

900
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,670
create a pool

901
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,410
crest will evaluate it and the next time

902
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:40,590
we come out with a new version if we

903
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:43,859
merge it's there we absolutely accept

904
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:45,420
all contributions we can you get it well

905
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:48,510
you saw me deploy it before it's

906
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:50,040
available now on github after this talk

907
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:52,940
I'm going to go outside and I'm going to

908
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:55,950
put up a little wiki you can actually

909
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:57,180
follow us in the development we're not

910
00:37:55,950 --> 00:38:00,740
going to make any changes for a little

911
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:03,720
while because I personally need a break

912
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:06,120
but if you follow master master will

913
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:08,009
always be the latest version this

914
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:10,109
presentation by the way is also in

915
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:13,260
github if you want to give this talk at

916
00:38:10,110 --> 00:38:16,050
your workplace or at your OS chapter or

917
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:19,890
your knock on chapter whatever it is you

918
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:22,200
can give the same presentation thank you

919
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:23,670
I will take questions I believe I'm a

920
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:39,240
tad early but I've got five minutes for

921
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:42,950
questions and while we're doing that no

922
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,950
I heard a phone

923
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:46,389
[Music]

924
00:38:46,499 --> 00:38:52,209
pepper watch this you gotta love them

925
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:53,589
was there any questions no well I'm here
