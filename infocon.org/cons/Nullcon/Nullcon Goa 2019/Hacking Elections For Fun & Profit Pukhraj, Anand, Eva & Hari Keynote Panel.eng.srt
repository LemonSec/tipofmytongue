1
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:10,000
morning everyone I know you're hungover

2
00:00:06,069 --> 00:00:12,070
and all that so that Ernest is 10 and

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,589
this is like every hacker conference

4
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:16,480
every second day second day of every

5
00:00:14,589 --> 00:00:18,430
hacking conference so it's all normal

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,950
for me but I'm gonna start this

7
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:25,120
discussion on a very somber note and I

8
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:27,430
saw him note you know cyber analysts

9
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:31,660
like me who work in the government have

10
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:35,999
been creating this scenario in in our

11
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:39,249
minds for a decade you know as to how

12
00:00:35,999 --> 00:00:40,960
the South Asian flashpoint would

13
00:00:39,249 --> 00:00:43,179
manifest in the information battle space

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,570
we saw that now what he saw in the last

15
00:00:43,179 --> 00:00:47,489
week happening in the cross between

16
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:50,350
India and Pakistan

17
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:54,780
his was actually a war we are still at

18
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:59,710
war and this low-intensity

19
00:00:54,780 --> 00:01:02,769
below threshold conflict under the

20
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:04,300
tactical nuclear weapons umbrella is the

21
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:08,770
new norm of war now

22
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:11,100
so we at war right now but there is an

23
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:14,320
interesting angle to this conflict now

24
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,270
this skirmish and I'm going to talk

25
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,130
about it slightly controversial but I

26
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,658
opening as well it's relevant to the

27
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:23,890
discussion before I introduce the

28
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:25,509
esteemed panelists since this is about

29
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:28,240
information operations and information

30
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:31,380
warfare and I

31
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,969
I don't shy away from naming names

32
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,189
Pakistan actually had an upper hand when

33
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:37,270
it came to information operations or

34
00:01:36,189 --> 00:01:39,939
information warfare we call it

35
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:42,210
perception management and Pakistan

36
00:01:39,939 --> 00:01:45,960
actually had some structural advantages

37
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:49,719
when it came to perception management

38
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:52,359
you know we luckily our democracy and

39
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:54,100
democracy has chaos so our perception

40
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:56,350
management was being handled by Ministry

41
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,979
of External Affairs and theirs was

42
00:01:56,350 --> 00:02:01,960
handled by a army outlet called the ISP

43
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:05,439
our inter-services public relations

44
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:08,258
which I deem as an agency as lethal as

45
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,959
the inter-services intelligence and the

46
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:13,869
way the handle perception management is

47
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:17,230
in this conflict I'm it was pretty mind

48
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:20,620
going it's also a it's alarming because

49
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:23,768
is PR is PR exactly fifth dimension

50
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:26,260
warfare and they are doing it largely to

51
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:28,120
control their own populations by the way

52
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:30,549
at this point they already created the

53
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:33,310
narrative that we have on the war but

54
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:37,720
now imagine if they weaponize this

55
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:41,470
narrative and unleash it upon us that's

56
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:44,620
pure high-grade full spectrum

57
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:47,500
no-holds-barred information warfare and

58
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:48,760
we sort of are I don't know ready for

59
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,290
that I don't know about that so I've

60
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,450
already conveyed my concerns to the

61
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:53,829
national security establishment so

62
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,940
that's actually this is very relevant to

63
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:59,140
the discussion what is happening right

64
00:02:54,940 --> 00:03:00,189
now this information war going on now a

65
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:01,779
little bit about the premise of the

66
00:03:00,189 --> 00:03:03,489
discussion because notice was too short

67
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:05,890
you know we structured this presentation

68
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:09,849
just one month ago I'm so glad

69
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:11,859
pardon me less than one month and what

70
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:15,369
happened was that I was I was tracking

71
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:17,500
uh I mean I I actually discovered the

72
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:18,879
first foreign disinformation operation

73
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,769
targeting India it was an Iranian

74
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,679
operation and Iran exactly technically

75
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:25,870
over a lie but it's very interesting

76
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:28,060
it's very interesting what the Iranians

77
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:30,159
were doing you can check the whole

78
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,640
analysis at my blog but I'm gonna come

79
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,120
to the point

80
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,518
I was actually attribute I was able to

81
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:39,120
attribute the disinformation operation

82
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:41,409
to a specific arm of the Iranian state

83
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,700
and some officials of the Iranian

84
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:46,599
Ministry actually so this was pretty

85
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:48,310
phenomenal and the outcome of this is it

86
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:53,950
could have multiple outcomes in our

87
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:56,019
national security environment now that

88
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:57,609
brought me into a group called the MIS

89
00:03:56,019 --> 00:04:00,010
InfoSec group which is part of the

90
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:02,010
credibility coalition it's a global body

91
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:06,819
which fights this disinformation and

92
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:09,340
misinformation is information and info

93
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:11,980
SEC so we are trying to create tool tax

94
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:14,049
tactics and procedures for from

95
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,670
misinformation disinformation just like

96
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:17,350
we have them for cybersecurity like

97
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,870
mitre attack and all these frameworks

98
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:21,549
and as of now they're just half a dozen

99
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:23,500
people in that group I mean they're very

100
00:04:21,548 --> 00:04:25,450
few cyber threat intelligence analysts

101
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:27,520
who have that kind of understanding of

102
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:29,800
information warfare one of them is gruff

103
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,240
and there are a couple of people from

104
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,040
serving members of the US Special

105
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:35,530
Operations Command and some other

106
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,330
like-minded people if I may say so and

107
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:39,099
this half a dozen people so if you're

108
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:41,050
looking for panelists and we like you

109
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,970
know there's no one here you know it's

110
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,940
like a it's like a wasteland

111
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:48,310
Elliot's wasteland right so and I

112
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:50,230
invited a National Security Advisor a

113
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:52,420
former one and also a Chief of Army

114
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:54,040
Staff but notice was too short they

115
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,540
didn't come and that's good you know

116
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,280
because in any case they didn't have any

117
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,350
idea what information warfare especially

118
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,320
cyber enabled so that gives us ample

119
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:05,140
time to you know discuss and you know

120
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:07,360
let's not you know smooth the

121
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,070
dignitaries let's talk about stuff no so

122
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,169
that's good

123
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:13,090
okay I'm also by the way are not not

124
00:05:11,169 --> 00:05:14,590
only moderate and I'm also a panelist so

125
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,869
I'm gonna take my own five minutes as

126
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,549
well just be patient with me but I'm

127
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:20,890
gonna first introduce you to the

128
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:29,130
esteemed panelists here I'm gonna start

129
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:31,180
with the the wonderful lady Eva Eva is

130
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,800
she's a fixture in the cybersecurity

131
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,820
community I have been following on

132
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:40,060
Twitter for a long time she is uh she's

133
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:42,550
one of those few people who live at the

134
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:45,040
intersection of civil liberties and I

135
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:47,260
would I would call it cyber operations

136
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:51,310
but she is a hacker as well you know

137
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:54,430
it's a real mix of talent and she calls

138
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:56,530
herself outraged fairy and with a

139
00:05:54,430 --> 00:06:00,850
beautiful hairdo she looks like a fairy

140
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:03,190
as well and she comes from you know her

141
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:06,790
parents migrated from Latvia which was

142
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:08,320
in the Soviet Union she understands the

143
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:11,169
power of free speech and I think it's

144
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:13,750
it's evident from a disposition like I

145
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:15,310
say in a writing standard and a work at

146
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,710
the Electronic Frontier Foundation I

147
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:21,310
mean I'm one of those people who still

148
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,810
read John Perry Barlow comments with the

149
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:25,180
volume night if you haven't read the -

150
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:29,440
you if you read that so it's a it's an

151
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:33,060
amazing institution I'm gonna stop in

152
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,060
there another hero here

153
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:43,440
Hari Prasad Mamoru in 2010 he hacked an

154
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:45,169
EVM right here in alcohol and he got

155
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,789
into trouble I mean this is how

156
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:49,710
whistleblowers are unfortunately treated

157
00:06:47,789 --> 00:06:54,000
sometimes by the government and I think

158
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:55,620
he was under custody for some time which

159
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,240
is okay I mean that's how all the rebels

160
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:01,889
even Gandhi was in the custody for some

161
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:03,690
time which is okay so you know and he

162
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:05,550
probably had to flee to India if I'm

163
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,979
able to join the dots correctly it's

164
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:11,849
been a long time but he's a hacker and a

165
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:14,580
whistleblower and he got the Electronic

166
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:17,849
Frontier Foundation's 2010 Pioneer Award

167
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:21,240
which is like Oscars for our you know

168
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:22,770
Authority yeah our attack my mom I want

169
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:27,479
to thank the Academy that kind of thing

170
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:29,990
you know all right Anand II I call him

171
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:33,240
an information militant and trust me I

172
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:35,970
say it with all the you know you know

173
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:39,150
with when you know it's it's a it's a

174
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:42,180
you know I renovate him and I come from

175
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:45,750
a frontier town of neurons are in Punjab

176
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:48,810
and he comes from you know Tamil Nadu we

177
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:50,280
sort of are you know those minorities

178
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:53,400
living at the fringes of the mainstream

179
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,169
work society so we we respect our rebels

180
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,650
we recept respect of buggy's he's a

181
00:07:55,169 --> 00:08:00,330
buggy and he is the one who wastes an

182
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:03,090
information warfare campaign against a

183
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:05,340
lahar and made sure the other eventually

184
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:08,159
turned out you know it's loopholes were

185
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:11,039
exposed by the way I was the first cyber

186
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:14,699
security manager of other so we should

187
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:17,610
be basically screaming at happy punching

188
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:20,009
each other in the faces but you know I

189
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:22,590
abide by Voltaire's philosophy that you

190
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:25,169
know I'm a disagree with you but I would

191
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:30,679
defend to death the right you know you

192
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:34,319
right to free speech now all right now

193
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:36,110
now comes my five minutes of fame my

194
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,279
five minutes of exposition if you will

195
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:39,839
because I need to set the stage here

196
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:41,338
because you know this is a new thing for

197
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,169
the audience most of them come from

198
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:45,450
typical cyber threat intelligence

199
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:47,520
backgrounds so I need to apprise them

200
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:50,310
of a new attack surface and I'm gonna

201
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:53,600
talk in your lingo but this lingo would

202
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:57,089
fit into a new jargon a new taxonomy

203
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:00,390
bass Albert's he is a he's an

204
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:01,920
exploitation engineer par excellence he

205
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,240
is one of the probably one of the

206
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,060
greatest exploit engineers in the

207
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:07,440
industry works at immunity

208
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:10,199
he was sitting in the toilet one day and

209
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,700
he load a long essay on daily Dave and

210
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:14,190
he said you know what we have been

211
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:15,540
hacking logical attack surfaces physical

212
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:18,390
attack surfaces where the Russians

213
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,099
actually attack the brain they attack

214
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:22,020
the brains attack surface and they

215
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:24,080
basically made the whole population a

216
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:27,030
program with programmable entity and

217
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,100
this is a very important fact when

218
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:32,010
exploit engineers start talking about

219
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:34,100
what I call cognitive cyber offense we

220
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,819
are at the cusp of a revolution here in

221
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,650
exploitation by the way this is

222
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:39,120
exploitation this is not this is not

223
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,319
 you know like we lot of

224
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,090
philosophers come here talk about

225
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,560
thought leaders talk about cybersecurity

226
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,390
this is not that this is a hardcore

227
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,900
exploitation by the way this cyber

228
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:51,060
offense let me give you another example

229
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:52,800
you know they have been last they have

230
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,020
largely two schools of thought when came

231
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,180
to cyber offense one came from the US

232
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:59,130
and the Allied powers the five eyes and

233
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,079
they're like deny he create disrupt the

234
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:03,090
adversity you know that's how hacking

235
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,800
work and that's our dominant narrative

236
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:07,980
because we're doing pretty well through

237
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,520
this time but the throughout the ages

238
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:13,320
the 19th century hacking I mean if you

239
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,520
see if you also count non-technical

240
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:20,220
hacking is hacking was always about

241
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:22,829
depressing deceiving and manipulating

242
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,690
the adversity the brains Russia always

243
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:25,800
thought about it that way in fact I

244
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,150
think the only innovation which has

245
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:32,880
happened in cyber offense for the last

246
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:35,459
30 years is actually the joining of the

247
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,080
merging of two attack surfaces of cyber

248
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,060
attack surfaces and the brains attack

249
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:41,100
surfaces I think the real innovation

250
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,680
came from Russia they were actually able

251
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:46,920
to move an older domain of warfare of

252
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,140
cyberspace so this is the second school

253
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:50,699
of hacking which is not dominant so we

254
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,790
are seeing a huge revolution here it's a

255
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:56,190
huge power tussle and I think a new kind

256
00:10:53,790 --> 00:10:59,459
of exploitation is emerging

257
00:10:56,190 --> 00:11:00,300
all right I'm just gonna talk about a

258
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,550
few more things

259
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,899
now another exploitation engineer I'm

260
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:06,000
gonna talk about him at Tate

261
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:08,579
Matthew Tate used to work at GCHQ he was

262
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,319
the one of the again a very fine I think

263
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:11,819
he was a Windows Exploitation engineer

264
00:11:10,319 --> 00:11:15,120
you know what he does now he teaches at

265
00:11:11,819 --> 00:11:16,740
Law School why we need hackers in law

266
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,860
school because hackers are the arbiters

267
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:23,009
of power now and secondly he's also the

268
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:25,560
first person to actually burst begins he

269
00:11:23,009 --> 00:11:26,879
had he was like okay DNC had Democratic

270
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,768
National Convention hack is at the

271
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:30,120
information operation he was the first

272
00:11:28,769 --> 00:11:31,529
one to do that before even the US

273
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:34,439
government did that at least in the

274
00:11:31,529 --> 00:11:35,819
public and why our hackers exploitation

275
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:38,189
engineers by they were talking about

276
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:40,378
information operations because that is

277
00:11:38,189 --> 00:11:44,670
the next domain of warfare cognitive

278
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:45,870
cyber offense trust me now now I'm gonna

279
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:47,490
talk about little more technicalities

280
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:49,259
I'm gonna say I'm gonna define how do

281
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:52,439
how to exploit this attack surfaces what

282
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:57,060
you see there are attack surfaces of the

283
00:11:52,439 --> 00:11:59,219
brain map in attack tsunami and you can

284
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,589
almost see don't have to read the image

285
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,970
just imagine it there's SQL injection

286
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:05,130
there's a stack overflow there's a heap

287
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:07,949
overflow and all that kind of stuff you

288
00:12:05,130 --> 00:12:10,920
know what I don't I'm not joking this

289
00:12:07,949 --> 00:12:13,349
you can actually create a programmable

290
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,759
exploit which would trigger a certain

291
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:18,540
response in the brain we are at that

292
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:20,100
stage of exploitation right now so I'm

293
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:23,040
just gonna talk about a few examples how

294
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:32,790
it happens so you know I was this I'm

295
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:34,529
sorry my mic Steptoe going too long it's

296
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:36,630
just important that I said the context

297
00:12:34,529 --> 00:12:38,790
because it's it's very new to everyone

298
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:42,000
and new to me as well this half a dozen

299
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:44,069
people in this group so let me give you

300
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,689
four examples how it happens it happened

301
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:48,779
to you by the way you all be manipulated

302
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:49,769
at this point now information warriors

303
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:53,579
you know that there is a thing called

304
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:55,980
the Overton Window and see now largely

305
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:57,930
of a national narrative of national

306
00:12:55,980 --> 00:13:01,139
discourse it's kind it's like a

307
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:02,969
crowdsource thing we together define

308
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:05,880
what are the boundaries of a discourse

309
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,930
and this happens informally it's called

310
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,639
the whole Overton Window

311
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:09,599
it's like a boundary which we create

312
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,790
around our

313
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,009
our discussion then we say okay beyond

314
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,240
this window everything is this is you

315
00:13:14,009 --> 00:13:17,009
should not talk about this you know this

316
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,829
is offensive within that window

317
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:22,589
everything is okay now what the hackers

318
00:13:19,829 --> 00:13:25,469
are doing they exploiting this open

319
00:13:22,589 --> 00:13:27,060
window huh let me tell you how and you

320
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:29,399
know exploiting this Overton Window is

321
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:31,768
not simple what I do is you wanna you

322
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:33,389
wanna include an extreme narrative into

323
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:35,250
the mainstream discussion how do you do

324
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:39,389
that you don't start with simple

325
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:42,300
escalation you start with we call it

326
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:45,329
toward in the face you start with the

327
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:47,969
extreme position right away and what

328
00:13:45,329 --> 00:13:50,609
happens when you when you amplify it on

329
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:52,259
social media the narrative becomes

330
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:54,630
extreme narrative becomes mainstream now

331
00:13:52,259 --> 00:13:56,459
what has happened the Overton Window is

332
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:58,980
like let's say it's like a it's like a

333
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:59,849
hexagon or ahora or a sphere or or

334
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,500
something like that

335
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:03,779
suddenly the Overton Window would

336
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:06,000
stretch to the extreme narrative and

337
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:10,019
it'll become mainstream let me tell you

338
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,339
how it happened India we actually got we

339
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:13,740
actually faced cognitive cyber offense

340
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:16,439
by the way you know the words like

341
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:18,209
anti-national it's okay it doesn't see

342
00:14:16,439 --> 00:14:20,219
number one doesn't matter what a

343
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:21,449
political ideology is at this point I'm

344
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,850
talking about information about fear

345
00:14:21,449 --> 00:14:27,079
when you start with the position which

346
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:31,560
is so extreme that anyone is either

347
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:33,120
nationalist or an anti-national this is

348
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,189
this is the door in the face because

349
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,750
there is no is a hardcore binary either

350
00:14:35,189 --> 00:14:38,819
you're with us or without us all right

351
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,100
and then the media picks it up and

352
00:14:38,819 --> 00:14:42,389
there's a times not debate nation wants

353
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:44,819
to know who's standing national who's

354
00:14:42,389 --> 00:14:47,759
not and certainly the Overton Window has

355
00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:50,160
stretched and an extreme narrative has

356
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:54,170
become mainstream that is information

357
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,130
warfare 101 so this is how it plays out

358
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:57,719
fact-checking doesn't work by the way

359
00:14:56,130 --> 00:15:01,889
fact-checking doesn't work because as

360
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:03,899
MIT MIT media the Media Lab of social

361
00:15:01,889 --> 00:15:05,519
machine said lies travel faster than

362
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:07,529
truth it's not going to work and

363
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,819
secondly these intermediaries like

364
00:15:07,529 --> 00:15:11,670
Facebook and Twitter they're not going

365
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:13,500
to help us you know what because just

366
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,899
like in cybersecurity the false

367
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,300
positives are too high you know if you

368
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:20,040
block the false positives of to detect

369
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,439
disinformation in a machine learning

370
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,250
wave I think 10 to 20 percent so if you

371
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:24,900
block hundred thousand

372
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:27,840
pages half of many of them would be

373
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:30,810
legit legitimate and that means lawsuits

374
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:33,060
so I'm just gonna sum up and and give

375
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:36,329
pass on the mic debate on to other

376
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:38,790
people so one of the researchers part of

377
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:41,040
a group he's a cognitive scientist but

378
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:43,199
he was early in an engineer and he says

379
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:45,300
red team yo brain by the way it's very

380
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,860
difficult to be neutral its we all

381
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,930
biased in some way or the other

382
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:50,940
he gave an example you know he was at

383
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:52,469
this panel discussion on information

384
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:55,410
warfare and he passed on a chair

385
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:57,480
everyone are you biased and they're like

386
00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:00,449
here we we study information warfare how

387
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,920
could we borrow that's an implement

388
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:03,360
simplistic bias we all have it's very

389
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,240
difficult to get rid of her biases

390
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:08,430
reading my own brain and these attack

391
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,800
surfaces how they manifest they were two

392
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:15,839
philosophers or to a psychoanalyst

393
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:18,229
Kahneman and Tversky they realize that

394
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:22,560
almost every human response is

395
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:24,060
replicable reproducible and it can be

396
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,270
triggered by certain information in

397
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:29,640
facts that we process brexit weaponized

398
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:31,230
it breaks it was just about micro

399
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,360
targeting it was what we call in

400
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:35,460
mathematics dimension reduction so a

401
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,230
human personality you know there's on an

402
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:40,050
average they would beat around 2400

403
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:43,050
gigabytes of data on every person you

404
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:45,390
know in 2020 what we clear is we create

405
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:48,089
a a multi-dimensional model of you a

406
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:49,830
profile it's very easy to create it by

407
00:16:48,089 --> 00:16:51,780
the way I don't need him I don't even

408
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,940
need your social media I can actually

409
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,319
create your psychological profile just

410
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,970
by following your retina movement by the

411
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,860
way at this point it tells a lot about

412
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:01,170
how anxious you are on your attic you

413
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:04,020
are by the way I can clearly create a

414
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:06,540
nice multi-dimensional profile I'm gonna

415
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:07,889
then Ward it using math and mathematical

416
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:10,889
modeling into a two-dimensional matrix

417
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:12,689
and that's what breaks it did nobody

418
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:15,270
talked about it because micro-targeting

419
00:17:12,689 --> 00:17:19,170
is sexy and somehow you know dimensional

420
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:20,910
reduction is not sexy so we this is the

421
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:24,839
future of cyber offense and that's my

422
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:26,459
sort of opening statement and let me

423
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:30,810
tell you one more thing just one and

424
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:33,390
I'll you know our social structure

425
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:36,510
throughout life remains the same you

426
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:39,300
always have one best friend to friend

427
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:40,830
these two BFFs and whatever like you

428
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,419
know and you know and a couple of you

429
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:44,699
know people you don't like but you have

430
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,530
to tolerate them your social structure

431
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:48,090
remains the same someone told me you

432
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:49,980
know what you want to exploit Putin's

433
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:51,720
mind you know whom to target because he

434
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:55,260
probably always have one best friend if

435
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:58,290
he has one and stuff like that people

436
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,730
may change but your social structure

437
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:02,639
would always remain the same on that

438
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:07,290
note let's open the discussion for

439
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:08,670
cognitive cyber offense and it's gonna

440
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:10,290
be extemporize I'm not gonna you know

441
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:13,080
lead you into a discussion let me open

442
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:22,159
it discussions with Eva if you permit

443
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:25,980
and hey there so I am going to begin by

444
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:30,330
disagreeing with most of the premises

445
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:33,420
that our esteemed panelists has just

446
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:37,080
laid out the first is the information

447
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:40,050
warfare is not new and it is not all

448
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:42,000
powerful to begin with anyone who has

449
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:45,030
ever had a marketing or a sales job

450
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,760
knows what information warfare is it's

451
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:51,120
just trying to get people to do what you

452
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,860
want them to do and if you are a

453
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:57,360
government maybe you want them to vote

454
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:59,820
for brexit but if you are a seller of

455
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:03,179
soymilk you just want them to buy your

456
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:06,000
soymilk when working for the Electronic

457
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:08,640
Frontier Foundation one of my sort of

458
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,070
jobs a few years in was that I worked as

459
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,780
a professional activist and activism is

460
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:16,020
essentially just trying to sell

461
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:19,320
something that isn't gross my job was to

462
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:21,840
sell people on the idea that digital

463
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,179
civil liberties meant something and that

464
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,850
they meant enough that you should give

465
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:30,540
EF f money or buy our stickers and

466
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:31,590
t-shirts or write the letters that we

467
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:34,379
thought that you should write to your

468
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:37,350
government or to various companies that

469
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:41,910
is all information warfare it's not

470
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:45,990
magic it's just marketing furthermore it

471
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:48,660
is not consistent and it can actually be

472
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:49,990
really difficult to replicate the idea

473
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:52,390
that humans are the

474
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:54,190
programmable machines and that we no

475
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:58,240
longer have free will and that we no

476
00:19:54,190 --> 00:20:00,100
longer have power is because if

477
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:04,840
that was true it wouldn't have been that

478
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:08,919
hard to sell the British on brexit or

479
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:12,220
Americans on Trump or any number of

480
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:14,860
countries on ultra-nationalism the

481
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:17,530
notion that information warfare is

482
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:20,580
incredibly powerful that some other

483
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:22,990
being or a country or power is

484
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:26,889
responsible for what your country just

485
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:29,790
did or the decisions that your people

486
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:32,140
have just made is really tempting it's

487
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:34,800
comforting because you want to believe

488
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:36,970
that the people you know didn't do that

489
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,950
you don't want to believe that your

490
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:42,340
country has just done something stupid

491
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:45,480
that they've just bought a lemon that

492
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:47,800
they have just bought into some

493
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:50,620
political ideology that you find

494
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:54,550
horrifying that they have just voted for

495
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:56,350
there's some kind of decision like

496
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:59,409
brexit which is not going to be terribly

497
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:03,909
good for okay let's go with anybody even

498
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:06,970
Teresa may so it's really easy to shift

499
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:08,080
the blame on to other people one of the

500
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:10,990
things to really remember about

501
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:13,840
information warfare and again I'm going

502
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:17,530
to go back to an earlier point I I am

503
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:20,080
from the Soviet Union I grew up in the

504
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:23,470
USSR and I moved to the United States as

505
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,600
a child and one of the things that that

506
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,940
my parents did all through my childhood

507
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:29,889
for reasons that I absolutely did not

508
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:34,270
understand at the time was they

509
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:37,929
continued to subscribe to the government

510
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:38,830
the Soviet government paper all through

511
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:42,850
the 80s

512
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:45,820
Pravda and it was full of lies there was

513
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:48,010
absolutely no question this was a an

514
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:50,439
instrument of the government that that

515
00:21:48,010 --> 00:21:51,970
toed the party line I told you what the

516
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,490
Communist Party wanted you to believe

517
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:56,980
about what was at the time a crumbling

518
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:58,809
Soviet Union it was chock full of lies

519
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:01,240
and I asked my father many years later

520
00:21:58,809 --> 00:22:02,220
when it finally occurred to me to go why

521
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,640
were you

522
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:07,500
subscribing to Pravda and he said

523
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,350
because when I was growing up I thought

524
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,970
I was really smart and I thought that I

525
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:14,370
could see through all the lies that the

526
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:16,980
government told us and that I understood

527
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:20,428
the truth and so what I wanted to do was

528
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:23,490
to make sure that I had a countless sort

529
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:25,650
of an endless reminder that I can't see

530
00:22:23,490 --> 00:22:28,950
the truth and that I'm not as smart as I

531
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:32,880
think I am that guy was pretty actually

532
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:35,159
pretty bright and to this day I still go

533
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,960
out of my way to read and analyze

534
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:39,120
government propaganda for this very

535
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,669
reason because only reading things that

536
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,840
you agree with is kind of a waste of

537
00:22:41,669 --> 00:22:44,789
time I don't need to spend all of my

538
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,928
time patting myself on the back telling

539
00:22:44,789 --> 00:22:50,669
myself how great I am

540
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:53,190
I have Twitter for that so one other

541
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:55,789
point that I wanted to make was the

542
00:22:53,190 --> 00:23:00,780
information warfare can be very powerful

543
00:22:55,789 --> 00:23:04,590
but mostly as a tipping point when you

544
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:10,520
are already dealing with a sort of weak

545
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:14,340
or sick or unprepared target or society

546
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:16,710
then information warfare campaigns can

547
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:19,590
be very effective in tipping things over

548
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:22,470
so if you have a close election or a

549
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:24,120
close vote or something along those

550
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:26,220
lines then information warfare can

551
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:28,139
really make a big difference the Soviet

552
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:30,179
Union engaged in information warfare

553
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:33,510
against the United States for the

554
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:34,830
entirety of the Cold War and for the

555
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:37,679
most part the things that it did

556
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:40,470
including you know going to Hollywood

557
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:44,090
and trying to undermine democratic

558
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:47,820
values through through movies and

559
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:52,139
influencing artists and starting

560
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:56,399
magazines and influencing politics none

561
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:59,549
of that worked there are so many

562
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:02,309
different reports that came out after

563
00:23:59,549 --> 00:24:05,340
the fall of the USSR chronicling these

564
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:08,850
efforts and the increasing frustration

565
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:11,549
that that the catchers had that it

566
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:13,610
wasn't working and part of that was that

567
00:24:11,549 --> 00:24:16,730
democracy was actually pretty

568
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:20,360
and when democracy is strong then it's

569
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:23,000
very hard for information warfare to be

570
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:27,590
effective but when democracy is weak

571
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,780
when corruption is high when it is very

572
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:31,010
easy for a lie to get all the way around

573
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,879
the world before the truth can get its

574
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:36,710
pants on

575
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:38,299
to quote Mark Twain that's really when

576
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:41,210
it can be effective and that's when we

577
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:43,760
need to take it very seriously we don't

578
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:45,710
need to believe that you know it's neuro

579
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,830
linguistic programming voodoo that's

580
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:50,630
going to that's going to change the way

581
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:52,340
that we think from a great distance by

582
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:56,150
just tracking the movements of our eyes

583
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:58,510
I think that's that's hyperbolic but I

584
00:24:56,150 --> 00:25:01,700
think we do still need to be aware of

585
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:03,740
exactly how these works one of the

586
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:05,660
sources that I would really strongly

587
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:07,400
recommend people read if they're

588
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:10,760
interested in sort of how information

589
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:15,380
warfare has worked on Twitter is Zeynep

590
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:17,290
traffic see who is a professor at I

591
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:19,490
think the University of North Carolina

592
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:22,190
and she's really fabulous and she wrote

593
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:26,720
a book called Twitter and teargas about

594
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:29,150
sort of the days of of Twitter and sort

595
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,030
of the Arab Spring around 2012 and kind

596
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:33,200
of how all of that fell apart so that

597
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:35,120
would be some very useful further

598
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,350
reading there there's a part of me that

599
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,418
really can't like give up the mic

600
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:54,110
without giving everybody homework for

601
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:56,090
which I apologize in advance but I come

602
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:58,040
of course I come from on the other side

603
00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:00,168
of the fence my job is to of course be

604
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:03,290
you I come for the machinery of war so I

605
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:04,400
see it differently I love that there

606
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,928
disagreements but I also have

607
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,880
disagreements with her disagreements I'm

608
00:26:05,929 --> 00:26:09,860
gonna be very specific about that to the

609
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:12,559
point so there's a guy called Wing

610
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:14,510
Commander Keith there he is he's

611
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:17,418
actually a cognitive psychologist who's

612
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:19,520
a warrior as a warrior as well in the

613
00:26:17,419 --> 00:26:21,980
you in the British military and he's now

614
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:26,300
doing a program called the future of war

615
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:27,530
and he actually says in fact what she

616
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,600
counters that humans

617
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:31,490
woman brain zactly programmable entities

618
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,840
very input-output in to interfaces we

619
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:35,270
have been reduced to that unfortunately

620
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:37,220
so had this great discussion an argument

621
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:38,870
with grukk and he says you know this is

622
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,510
an older people a book in a new

623
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:43,010
battleground but the other reader

624
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:45,020
scientists or cognitive scientists are

625
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:47,960
believing that data-driven behavior

626
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:50,420
modeling because now we can go wide then

627
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:53,210
beep it creates a new domain because if

628
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:54,770
you see I means if you read TS Kern the

629
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:56,570
structure of scientific revolutions I

630
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:58,520
mean there's always precursor to our

631
00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:00,379
technology but then there's always a

632
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:02,210
breaking point when it becomes a new

633
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,950
technology in itself I'm gonna give you

634
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:08,420
just one example how it actually plays

635
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:11,540
out now I lost my train of thought

636
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:13,520
but especially about you know there's a

637
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:15,860
specific point yeah XenApp tough sake

638
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,889
I've read a book I don't think she is a

639
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:20,780
I want she's she I loved a book but I

640
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:23,480
don't think she understands the nature

641
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:25,370
of war or raising it from a

642
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:27,980
psychological perspective I mean she is

643
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:30,649
a it's a beautiful heart-rending book I

644
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:34,790
also read so Shana Zubov smokes on my

645
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:36,410
I'm a closeted bro but you know when it

646
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:38,629
comes to waging war it works a little

647
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:40,820
differently and I wanted to give you a

648
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:42,980
few examples but I just sort of you know

649
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:45,189
you know miss the point but let me give

650
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:48,080
me see if I can just you know this

651
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:49,550
counter her comment with something but

652
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,790
in any case you can go through Wing

653
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:53,840
Commander Keith Ayers presentation and

654
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:56,420
and see that actually we have become

655
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:58,189
programmable entities with specific into

656
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:01,310
input-output interfaces we actually are

657
00:27:58,190 --> 00:28:04,610
sort of algorithmic I mean see the whole

658
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:07,639
idea her idea about defending our

659
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:11,709
individual individuality or or free will

660
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:14,630
Atlee is is the Westons

661
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:15,770
you know notion of neoliberalism and

662
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:19,430
into the whole idea of Western

663
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:21,050
enlightenment and and it it may not work

664
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:22,850
scientifically you know there could be

665
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:31,190
contestations there so I'll just leave

666
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:33,139
it at that or not and yeah so most of my

667
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:37,000
experience and information warfare is

668
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:40,190
another okay and to put it very simply

669
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,320
two years ago I was mildly supportive of

670
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:42,909
the program

671
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:45,070
because of what I call as a taxpaying

672
00:28:42,909 --> 00:28:47,200
vulnerability right and I just explained

673
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:49,570
to it how many of you believe that your

674
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,200
tax dollars or tax rupees or wasted by

675
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:54,850
the government just rise up your hands

676
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,470
right have you actually understood

677
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:58,959
that's the most important manner ability

678
00:28:56,470 --> 00:29:01,690
that other used okay there's a let me

679
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,700
explain to that and it's important that

680
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:05,440
you understand the vulnerability because

681
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,850
almost all of us feel that our tax

682
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,879
rupees are being wasted on something

683
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:11,559
right and in India we have a so-called

684
00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:14,830
socialistic government or welfare

685
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:16,480
government and people believe that tax

686
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:18,460
dollars I'm giving which the government

687
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,679
is spending on welfare is basically a

688
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:22,389
waste and hence has to be managed

689
00:29:20,679 --> 00:29:24,429
properly there's nothing wrong about it

690
00:29:22,389 --> 00:29:25,959
right that's a that's a desire that you

691
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,549
have but there's also a deep

692
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:30,730
vulnerability so what the government

693
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:32,830
actually used 2 years back was the real

694
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:34,799
not an information war belt warfare

695
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:37,928
program funded by the World Bank

696
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:39,879
actively and abetted by a whole bunch of

697
00:29:37,929 --> 00:29:41,289
states including the state of under

698
00:29:39,879 --> 00:29:43,509
police in Telangana I will come back to

699
00:29:41,289 --> 00:29:44,830
that right right

700
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:47,080
including a state of andhra pradesh and

701
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:49,480
telangana which use the word billions

702
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:51,699
alright now how many of you really

703
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:53,289
believe that the word billion dollars

704
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,590
create a cognitive dissonance on your

705
00:29:53,289 --> 00:29:54,960
head

706
00:29:53,590 --> 00:30:01,779
do you really know how to count it I

707
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:06,340
mean as an example no you can yes ok so

708
00:30:01,779 --> 00:30:09,149
you may probably be dissonance it's just

709
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:11,289
attack surface I call it so basically

710
00:30:09,149 --> 00:30:13,229
when you are because of your upbringing

711
00:30:11,289 --> 00:30:15,100
because of a nature and nurture

712
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:17,049
depending on where you come from you

713
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:19,629
have fixed set of ideas which defines

714
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:23,408
you defines who you are like in this

715
00:30:19,629 --> 00:30:28,509
case came from the Soviet Union value is

716
00:30:23,409 --> 00:30:32,409
a free idea free speech and he has one

717
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:35,409
rule so when what what in what this

718
00:30:32,409 --> 00:30:37,149
information does is they specifically by

719
00:30:35,409 --> 00:30:40,090
profiling you they give you certain in

720
00:30:37,149 --> 00:30:42,129
from new in set of information which

721
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:43,418
which challenges your existing set of

722
00:30:42,129 --> 00:30:45,340
beliefs and you know what happens

723
00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:47,760
something very predictable because

724
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:49,350
that's my contestation

725
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,260
I believe that everything is predictable

726
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:53,399
in this phase of outcome of events you

727
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,960
know when you actually when you

728
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,310
countered with new information which is

729
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,870
conflicting with your worldview or

730
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:59,879
disposition on which your whole life is

731
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:01,860
based on let's say you cast your you

732
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,080
know social standing or everything you

733
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:06,030
know it triggers an emotional response

734
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,020
in you it doesn't trigger a logical

735
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:08,190
response in you it'd take us an

736
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:10,350
emotional response you like if this is

737
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:12,090
 man or this is great yeah I

738
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:14,520
hope this is great and that's where all

739
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:18,240
the whatsapp uncle's and all the echo

740
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:20,520
chambers come from so no okay yeah so so

741
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:22,410
what happens what happens in the case of

742
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:24,060
the billion dollars is that you were

743
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:27,000
told a very specific information about

744
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:30,810
the other program which is it saved 12

745
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,940
billion dollars okay I mean it was such

746
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:34,919
an important what they call its

747
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:37,440
extension of the wharton window because

748
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:39,060
you basically said you know what you

749
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,340
haven't hidden malleability my tax has

750
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:43,470
to work this damn program yeah sure it

751
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:46,169
collects biometrics fair enough it's

752
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:47,910
safe and safe whatever but when you're

753
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:50,340
told the specific number called twelve

754
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:51,660
billion dollars in here which is seventy

755
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:54,030
five thousand crores and a thousand

756
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:55,260
crores the mind boggles and and it

757
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:57,240
created an emotional response you know

758
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:59,190
safe air whatever maybe the government

759
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,570
is right and you moved on now here's the

760
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:02,550
most important thing I figured out two

761
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:04,770
years back when I looked at it because

762
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:07,710
of my past history of being a balance

763
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:09,360
sheet hacker before actually I mean

764
00:32:07,710 --> 00:32:10,470
hacker on the programming when I

765
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,209
actually looked through those numbers

766
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:15,420
the government put out and mind you this

767
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:17,310
is on LPG the gas savings it was written

768
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:25,340
by none other than the chief economic

769
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:28,980
adviser of India not Subramanyam

770
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:30,870
nagarajan Arvind Subramanian I mean

771
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:32,640
subrahmanyam it was written none other

772
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:34,800
than the chief economic adviser Arvind

773
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:36,630
Subramanyam and it was published in no

774
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,909
other place except New York Times the

775
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:39,570
damn thing basically said other saves

776
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:41,580
billions

777
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:42,600
yeah sure there were privacy problems

778
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,699
yeah sure whatever

779
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:47,699
but others save billions on LPG right

780
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:49,650
and guess what I actually went deep dive

781
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,330
all the way into multiple state

782
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:53,460
government budget sheets went all the

783
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:55,409
way down to the center I tracked every

784
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,610
single oil shipment in this country and

785
00:32:55,410 --> 00:33:00,840
you know what was the actual number I

786
00:32:56,610 --> 00:33:02,939
came up guess what after

787
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:05,629
the costs were taken the minimum loss

788
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:09,330
that we suffer is 1 billion dollars just

789
00:33:05,629 --> 00:33:11,279
on LPG itself right so what you

790
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:13,139
basically got is an information warfare

791
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:15,509
in your brain and the damn thing worked

792
00:33:13,139 --> 00:33:17,279
right I mean it's a classical example

793
00:33:15,509 --> 00:33:19,499
about the damn thing work even today

794
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:22,769
people believe in my family what's our

795
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:24,509
groups that well maybe it's not what

796
00:33:22,769 --> 00:33:26,309
twelve billion dollars but maybe it is

797
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:28,080
hundred crores but is it it not greater

798
00:33:26,309 --> 00:33:31,769
than zero I mean why are you against it

799
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,570
right so you can just you can see the

800
00:33:31,769 --> 00:33:35,940
molding pattern here then the pattern

801
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:38,129
got extended to guess what another

802
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:40,379
interesting problem of the middle class

803
00:33:38,129 --> 00:33:42,869
brain which I call it as the M in Riga

804
00:33:40,379 --> 00:33:44,549
program so we have a guaranteed work for

805
00:33:42,869 --> 00:33:46,168
the rural poor program called M in Riga

806
00:33:44,549 --> 00:33:47,759
the government basically wrote a

807
00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:49,470
wonderful I mean this time they didn't

808
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:52,049
even bother with chief economic adviser

809
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:55,139
New York Times in stuff like that they

810
00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:58,259
basically use local Z TV and whatsapp

811
00:33:55,139 --> 00:34:00,449
ropes right and they said well so much

812
00:33:58,259 --> 00:34:03,929
of goes so much of power so much of

813
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:06,809
subsidy savings they even got two guys

814
00:34:03,929 --> 00:34:08,339
from a forward Michigan State University

815
00:34:06,809 --> 00:34:09,569
some economists in Michigan State

816
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:12,509
University will go back and look at it

817
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:14,940
to write a wonderful article about how

818
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:17,510
biometrics saved America programs and

819
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:20,700
the pilot program was on under Pradesh

820
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:22,500
right and so if you look at it and if

821
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:25,109
you look at in general Andhra Pradesh

822
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:27,149
was what I call is a nerve center of the

823
00:34:25,109 --> 00:34:29,520
other mean disinformation campaigns

824
00:34:27,149 --> 00:34:31,348
right because of two interesting reasons

825
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:34,079
one is that most of the statistics are

826
00:34:31,349 --> 00:34:35,639
so made up right we just have one look

827
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,990
at it and you say it makes no sense but

828
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:38,940
the question is they were backing up on

829
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:40,290
the fact that who in this bloody idiotic

830
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:41,849
country call India would actually go

831
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:45,480
look into state government budget I mean

832
00:34:41,849 --> 00:34:47,069
how many of the people right how many

833
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:49,859
people even look at the damn credit card

834
00:34:47,069 --> 00:34:51,779
reports right so this is basically a

835
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:53,098
massive ulnar ability in the population

836
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:55,169
so you may call yourself a great

837
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:56,460
cybersecurity hacker who would write a

838
00:34:55,168 --> 00:34:59,009
whole bunch of reports on data security

839
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:00,450
another but are you really mad enough to

840
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:01,650
go and look at a state government budget

841
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:03,868
when you don't even look at a credit

842
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:05,369
card butter this is exploitation surface

843
00:35:03,869 --> 00:35:06,030
at a very different level and the damn

844
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:07,920
thing worked

845
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:10,290
believe me the damn thing worked right

846
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,150
and when I started writing about it

847
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:14,300
the first cognitive dissonance I face is

848
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:16,830
who the are you

849
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:18,840
right I mean you are I mean you're

850
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:21,779
arguing with New York Times author

851
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:23,790
I mean economists with pedigree of PhD

852
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:26,400
from Michigan and an chief economic

853
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:27,840
adviser who the hell are you so this is

854
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,330
cognitive attack surface in the sense

855
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:33,600
that it's not about the data it's about

856
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:35,460
the reputation of the person who's

857
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:38,660
saying the lie and believe me the first

858
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:41,730
time it worked right the second time

859
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:45,420
Arvind Subramanian himself a bliss a not

860
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:49,290
so apologetic recanted on Indian Express

861
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:52,200
but no not new of times right and it

862
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:56,400
basically made a statement which said it

863
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:58,890
is a probabilistic potential projection

864
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,780
blah blah blah blah but when article in

865
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:03,600
York Times said it's same I mean

866
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:05,520
remember the distinction about about how

867
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,830
it worked right and this is just an

868
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,940
example of what I call his cognitive

869
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:10,920
attack surface

870
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:12,840
I would also discuss next with my friend

871
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:15,630
whom I call friend because we work

872
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:17,820
collaborate on this he was a previous

873
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:20,310
BJP campaign analyst right called him

874
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:22,530
son cursing his job believe me and I

875
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:25,500
tell you does his job was to win Manipur

876
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:27,690
and the Northeast using a data collected

877
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:30,510
at a boating at a polling booth level

878
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:33,600
through which micro targeted messages

879
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:35,670
for each individual is sent right which

880
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:37,170
actually altered the outcome of the

881
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:40,380
entire northeast elections apart from

882
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:41,790
other factors so and so here's the

883
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:44,940
interesting part about India right which

884
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:48,630
is as a country we are a lot more

885
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:49,920
emotional right and we have unique

886
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:52,620
attack surfaces which we have to be

887
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:53,850
cognizant about and the Unitec attack

888
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,830
surfaces which you're cognizant about is

889
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:59,100
about caste and creed which a westerner

890
00:36:55,830 --> 00:37:01,140
probably can't understand right and the

891
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:04,020
other thing that we have in common with

892
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:06,870
the whole of the world is about what we

893
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:09,150
call is government belief environment

894
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:10,529
and the biggest belief the biggest

895
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:11,910
attack surface in India is most of the

896
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,480
population actually believe in the

897
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:14,069
government

898
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,270
I mean unlock in the West which had a

899
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:16,470
history of not believing in the

900
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:18,390
government so that's why the other

901
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:19,919
savings kind of stuff worked so what

902
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:21,529
what Shivam Shankar Singh I mean he

903
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:24,090
wrote a very wonderful book about called

904
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:25,520
how to win an Indian election I really

905
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:27,680
recommend you read it

906
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:29,210
you can really understand how they had

907
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,308
operator so the way we see if we could

908
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:34,819
not have that India population fall for

909
00:37:31,309 --> 00:37:37,000
grand narratives okay and so what he did

910
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:39,290
was they basically scraped off electoral

911
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,599
electoral list which are ready with

912
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:44,450
public and as part of the other project

913
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:45,710
there were multiple multiple databases

914
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:47,509
that was built with a state government

915
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:49,579
which had beneficiary data and stuff

916
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:51,829
like that and so you just basically pull

917
00:37:49,579 --> 00:37:52,970
the map and mix it up and as usual if

918
00:37:51,829 --> 00:37:54,490
you understand recent Converse

919
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:58,098
controversy by the Election Commission

920
00:37:54,490 --> 00:38:00,049
they made other in voter ID linking and

921
00:37:58,099 --> 00:38:03,260
a syrup service manner so they her

922
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:05,930
accurate profiles about this water in

923
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:08,230
this particular pulling both is this

924
00:38:05,930 --> 00:38:11,569
caste and he got these government

925
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:13,880
beneficiaries and maybe he was for the

926
00:38:11,569 --> 00:38:16,640
BJP maybe he was for the Congress maybe

927
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:18,559
he is swinging so what should be the

928
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:20,299
precise whatsapp message I should send

929
00:38:18,559 --> 00:38:22,849
him so that he ODS over or what's

930
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:24,890
against right this is micro-targeting

931
00:38:22,849 --> 00:38:27,589
beyond what even cam Regionalliga cannot

932
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:28,970
imagine and it worked okay and I know

933
00:38:27,589 --> 00:38:30,490
how it worked and here's the interesting

934
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:33,618
thing

935
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:37,669
yeah yeah I know how it worked

936
00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:39,140
I've actually seen the dashboards right

937
00:38:37,670 --> 00:38:40,700
I've actually seen the campaign

938
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:43,640
dashboard on to the political parties

939
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:46,040
and it is mind-blowing that some day it

940
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:48,290
will probably come out right and the

941
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:50,119
recent controversy on AP and Telangana

942
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:52,130
was also done by my friend again

943
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:55,670
shinhwa's Pro kodály who actually

944
00:38:52,130 --> 00:39:00,349
figured out that TDP had a wonderful

945
00:38:55,670 --> 00:39:03,700
application called Miss Ava right Ava

946
00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:07,040
means it is Ava Mitra right which

947
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:09,379
collected polling booth data and pulled

948
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,390
out data from the SRD heads and actually

949
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:13,010
created what we call as the panoramic

950
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:16,098
model I mean panel book model is

951
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:16,910
basically what Congress started at 1950s

952
00:39:16,099 --> 00:39:19,190
right

953
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:21,230
so it basically says there is a water

954
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:23,089
list every polling booth and you print

955
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:25,790
it on the pages every page is called as

956
00:39:23,089 --> 00:39:27,558
a panel right and you basically mark

957
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:29,270
down on every guy saying what is this

958
00:39:27,559 --> 00:39:31,369
predictions I mean is it like there's

959
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:32,690
this there's this you basically mark him

960
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,619
saying you will definitely vote for this

961
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:35,119
party will definitely vote for this

962
00:39:33,619 --> 00:39:37,520
party so political party basically

963
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:39,260
assigns the penumbra democracies or you

964
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,270
just do it on a page-by-page basis

965
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,620
and there is just no digitalized I mean

966
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:45,350
what we did in the paper in those days

967
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:47,120
is now digitalize and it works and just

968
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:49,370
like Eva said remember it's not about

969
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:51,560
influencing a large population it's

970
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:53,540
about just swinging a population there

971
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,370
is sufficient enough which will get you

972
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:57,529
the results so if you look at

973
00:39:55,370 --> 00:40:00,170
Shippensburg it talks about how he

974
00:39:57,530 --> 00:40:02,270
actually did it in the North entire

975
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:04,340
northeast so these aren't practitioners

976
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:05,780
I don't care much about theory maybe

977
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:08,120
we're operating on the theoretical space

978
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:10,430
or not like it's probably evolving but

979
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:12,650
what always comes is the results and

980
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:15,319
then the practice and then the theory

981
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:24,610
it's never the forward yeah

982
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:30,950
Thanks so seriously nervous to talk now

983
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:33,590
okay I was telling our moderator

984
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:36,200
panelists today that there are some

985
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:39,020
limitations which I may be able to spell

986
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:43,819
out them I may not be able to but yes

987
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:46,810
I want to talk a lot whatever is

988
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:53,920
possible let me try to express it out

989
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:58,130
first of all being a red team is easy

990
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:59,840
not a blue team you know so sitting on

991
00:40:58,130 --> 00:41:02,690
the other side I don't know how many are

992
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:05,360
there here in the blue team they know

993
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:08,830
what's the problem when you have to sit

994
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:13,580
on the hot seat and defend everything

995
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:15,850
and I do agree with the information

996
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:15,850
warfare

997
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:18,598
even we do

998
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:25,539
let me tell about myself I am I am not

999
00:41:22,779 --> 00:41:27,220
just the advisor of Technology to the

1000
00:41:25,539 --> 00:41:28,420
government of Andhra Pradesh especially

1001
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:36,129
to the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh

1002
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:38,559
I am also an advisor to the party so

1003
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:40,390
maybe you you may want to know certain

1004
00:41:38,559 --> 00:41:43,119
information see generally what happens

1005
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:45,220
is whenever something comes out we build

1006
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:50,980
our own stories and we think that that

1007
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:55,419
is true or maybe true like what Anand

1008
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:56,079
was saying about Miss Ava Elias Sarah

1009
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:59,079
Mitra

1010
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:03,309
it's actually Sarah Metra the

1011
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:08,200
information collected by Telugu Desam

1012
00:42:03,309 --> 00:42:10,390
Party is not from s RDH in fact it's

1013
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:13,029
much more powerful than Assadi HS RDH

1014
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:19,000
has nothing the information covered by

1015
00:42:13,029 --> 00:42:23,430
them is nothing you know see to win a

1016
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:26,349
war I want to tell you like generally

1017
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:30,069
when we feel that we are benevolent and

1018
00:42:26,349 --> 00:42:31,690
we try to wage war against somebody who

1019
00:42:30,069 --> 00:42:34,410
is a devil it's not that easy to win

1020
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:39,099
that's what I believe

1021
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:41,379
not maybe everybody believes always when

1022
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:43,029
we do something we don't do with an evil

1023
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:48,130
intention generally we do with a good

1024
00:42:43,029 --> 00:42:51,130
intention before 2014 there was a survey

1025
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:54,400
done by the Telugu Desam Party though

1026
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:56,829
through door the information collected

1027
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:00,819
from the people with their own will

1028
00:42:56,829 --> 00:43:06,460
where we collected a lot yes along with

1029
00:43:00,819 --> 00:43:09,279
that the odour list is always mapped on

1030
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:12,609
a periodic interval because it changes a

1031
00:43:09,279 --> 00:43:15,009
lot so as I said the information is not

1032
00:43:12,609 --> 00:43:18,460
from Assad eh in fact if Assad eh wants

1033
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:20,589
we have a batch database the better

1034
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:22,420
database with more economic profile

1035
00:43:20,589 --> 00:43:24,190
because that time when we were doing we

1036
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:26,109
were doing with the economic profile

1037
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:28,790
like trying to understand when a

1038
00:43:26,109 --> 00:43:30,620
government fellow I mean to say like

1039
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:32,180
somebody goes for a survey from the

1040
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:33,470
government side generally the

1041
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:36,589
information even from the citizen

1042
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:38,450
doesn't come right you know even a guy

1043
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:40,820
who has a car will try to say that he is

1044
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:43,009
he's running on something hundred rupee

1045
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:48,140
a day because he want to have all those

1046
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:50,060
benefits so let me come back from that

1047
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:51,950
because I just want to cover it up that

1048
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:55,340
Siva Mitra is not that bad

1049
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:59,810
save Amita has information and that

1050
00:43:55,340 --> 00:44:02,270
information is used for yes the election

1051
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:05,720
intelligence we just want to understand

1052
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:08,960
we just want to understand like whether

1053
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:11,620
they are being influenced by this kind

1054
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:16,610
of information that is happening in

1055
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:21,080
social media you can see like people are

1056
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:23,780
being navigated to a particular

1057
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:25,190
information to believe and in fact even

1058
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:26,990
check themselves whether they are

1059
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:30,380
correct or the information is correct

1060
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:32,529
and they will be in a confusion that's

1061
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:35,380
what today's politicians are using

1062
00:44:32,530 --> 00:44:40,010
convince them or confuse them

1063
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:42,710
so always like what happens is how do I

1064
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:44,960
confuse the person who doesn't vote for

1065
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:47,510
me and how do I convince a person who

1066
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:51,020
votes for me that's how things are

1067
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:53,270
happening in India today people are

1068
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:59,330
talking about election hacking and all

1069
00:44:53,270 --> 00:45:01,160
that's very small the the way it is

1070
00:44:59,330 --> 00:45:04,910
being hacked as through the minds of the

1071
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:09,940
people today yep it is through the minds

1072
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:14,589
of the people and let me come back

1073
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:16,539
200 possession of it is for you guys or

1074
00:45:14,589 --> 00:45:18,970
anybody working in information security

1075
00:45:16,539 --> 00:45:21,970
you need a subject to actually work upon

1076
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:26,020
and mr. Naidu is open enough to be the

1077
00:45:21,970 --> 00:45:27,399
guinea epic he always said that and you

1078
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:28,780
are able to talk about it because there

1079
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:30,910
is a government which is trying to do it

1080
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:34,119
and in fact the government itself has

1081
00:45:30,910 --> 00:45:35,980
now under the evil guidance of mr. Naidu

1082
00:45:34,119 --> 00:45:38,559
has a cybersecurity wing which is

1083
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:40,270
hacking left and right every day every

1084
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:42,400
department and sending the information

1085
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:45,990
to them and asking them to correct it

1086
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:49,119
it's not that easy to correct because

1087
00:45:45,990 --> 00:45:54,129
you are habituated to a way of living

1088
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:58,059
and you love to do so and you know what

1089
00:45:54,130 --> 00:46:01,150
the the theory that what people are the

1090
00:45:58,059 --> 00:46:03,720
department heads will will come to

1091
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:08,200
defend about their department they say

1092
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:10,839
the other department is also hacked they

1093
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:12,848
don't say that why I am hacked the other

1094
00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:16,690
department also hacked let him be strong

1095
00:46:12,849 --> 00:46:19,089
first right but actually to say it is

1096
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:21,549
very dangerous nowadays it is too

1097
00:46:19,089 --> 00:46:23,819
dangerous that the people who know can

1098
00:46:21,549 --> 00:46:26,529
dominate the people who doesn't know and

1099
00:46:23,819 --> 00:46:29,770
most of the people doesn't understand

1100
00:46:26,529 --> 00:46:31,180
the security part of it the rural

1101
00:46:29,770 --> 00:46:33,369
population doesn't understand the

1102
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:35,049
security part of it and the people who

1103
00:46:33,369 --> 00:46:40,410
know it are able to do it

1104
00:46:35,049 --> 00:46:47,940
and and if it comes to elections see I

1105
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:50,049
was always watching for an open hardware

1106
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:52,210
for the voting machines what we are

1107
00:46:50,049 --> 00:46:55,270
using the reason being like the more you

1108
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:56,980
trying to put it to the people they'll

1109
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:58,690
come up with lot of vulnerabilities not

1110
00:46:56,980 --> 00:47:01,660
one person or a group can able to find

1111
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:03,309
out everything it has to be open but

1112
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:05,770
somehow whatever be the reason the

1113
00:47:03,309 --> 00:47:09,430
Election Commission of India is even now

1114
00:47:05,770 --> 00:47:11,259
stubborn they they did to some extent

1115
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:12,788
but again in a closed manner they

1116
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:15,339
introduced the vpats

1117
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:18,279
but again says that I'll count only 1% I

1118
00:47:15,339 --> 00:47:20,500
don't know what is that 1% and which has

1119
00:47:18,279 --> 00:47:22,900
no validation in fact I mean to say even

1120
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:24,970
the the water verify

1121
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:27,940
paper audit trail which we actually

1122
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:30,279
fought for was not this one we actually

1123
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:33,160
fought for something where there is a

1124
00:47:30,279 --> 00:47:34,930
validation that a voter can say this is

1125
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:37,118
correct what I ordered or this is not

1126
00:47:34,930 --> 00:47:39,819
correct there is nothing like that in

1127
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:41,200
that it is just another display where

1128
00:47:39,819 --> 00:47:44,470
you have to see and you have elevate to

1129
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:47,200
drop it into the box and whatever

1130
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:50,189
surveys happen till date says that more

1131
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:55,210
than 80% doesn't even look at it today

1132
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:57,220
so the threat still prevails and it is

1133
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:59,020
not many people in the Election

1134
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:01,270
Commission says that we are different

1135
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:03,490
from other parts of the country other

1136
00:48:01,270 --> 00:48:05,579
parts of the world the machines are

1137
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:10,808
different they are not connected and all

1138
00:48:05,579 --> 00:48:16,210
but they simply forget that the origin

1139
00:48:10,809 --> 00:48:18,970
of this chip is not known or I mean to

1140
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:20,799
say like we have to make believe that

1141
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:24,848
the companies which are supplying these

1142
00:48:20,799 --> 00:48:27,700
ships are secure safe and do what only

1143
00:48:24,849 --> 00:48:32,170
we want which we can't check again we

1144
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:35,890
have to just trust and believe in

1145
00:48:32,170 --> 00:48:37,990
Elections Trust is not what you should

1146
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:39,339
accept it is verifiability and

1147
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:44,348
accountability that's what we always

1148
00:48:39,339 --> 00:48:47,710
fight for and that's what even our

1149
00:48:44,349 --> 00:48:50,349
leader mr. Naidu actually fights for it

1150
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:52,410
in fact he says like if you can't find a

1151
00:48:50,349 --> 00:48:55,299
solution let's go back to paper ballot

1152
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:58,868
it is not that like he is trying to

1153
00:48:55,299 --> 00:49:01,690
actually divert the attention of the

1154
00:48:58,869 --> 00:49:06,309
people know it is just he want to be the

1155
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:10,000
the target he want to be the target so

1156
00:49:06,309 --> 00:49:13,839
that people can can give attention to

1157
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:19,779
what is going on the information warfare

1158
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:22,630
and this kind of hacking can can really

1159
00:49:19,779 --> 00:49:24,579
show the results as if they are as per

1160
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:26,410
the sentiment but it is not that's what

1161
00:49:24,579 --> 00:49:29,440
it is only those swing words it's not

1162
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:31,980
required that you need to hack all the

1163
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,980
polling booths

1164
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,828
with the kind of information what every

1165
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:37,450
party is collecting see we came open

1166
00:49:35,829 --> 00:49:39,250
saying that we collected this

1167
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:40,779
information do you think that the other

1168
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:42,520
parties have are not having the

1169
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:45,910
information they have they don't come

1170
00:49:42,520 --> 00:49:48,250
out and they know very well that which

1171
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:50,589
polling booth has what percentage of

1172
00:49:48,250 --> 00:49:53,079
force that comes to us what doesn't come

1173
00:49:50,589 --> 00:49:55,450
to us then a simple computational

1174
00:49:53,079 --> 00:49:57,609
mathematics will give us where what is

1175
00:49:55,450 --> 00:50:00,129
the heat map and with the heat map we

1176
00:49:57,609 --> 00:50:02,440
have to work with the targets and when

1177
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:04,210
others is any way of working with that

1178
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:08,579
kind of intelligent tools do you think

1179
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:11,140
that we should the want to be fair

1180
00:50:08,579 --> 00:50:12,910
transparent work with only conventional

1181
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:14,259
tools where you go with your bow and

1182
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:18,480
arrows and the other guy is coming here

1183
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:18,480
bombarding you it's not possible and

1184
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:26,410
this is what I want to say and and so we

1185
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:27,730
have gone way past the lotted time so we

1186
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:28,990
may not be able to encourage quotient

1187
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:30,880
and also that's also a kind of

1188
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:33,790
information warfare on you because it's

1189
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:36,760
one-dimensional but I'm just gonna end

1190
00:50:33,790 --> 00:50:39,160
it on a very humble note you know we are

1191
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:40,750
still at war so you know the the

1192
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:44,859
undertones are slightly emotional if you

1193
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:47,020
will you know the way to defend

1194
00:50:44,859 --> 00:50:49,359
ourselves is so simple let me

1195
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:51,970
tell you that you know till mhf dolly

1196
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:55,020
came roaring the Himalayas were of a

1197
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:57,910
national our natural you know defense

1198
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:59,559
now you know I'm gonna quote the deputy

1199
00:50:57,910 --> 00:51:01,808
director of the National Security Agency

1200
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:03,609
Chris English you know guy who was

1201
00:51:01,809 --> 00:51:05,349
probably hacked the whole world and he

1202
00:51:03,609 --> 00:51:06,819
has some very nice advice on how to

1203
00:51:05,349 --> 00:51:09,460
defend ourselves on information warfare

1204
00:51:06,819 --> 00:51:12,160
and that is simple diversity beats

1205
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:14,140
audacity you know if you homogenize

1206
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:16,390
yourself as a society if you want to

1207
00:51:14,140 --> 00:51:19,990
become something which is one into

1208
00:51:16,390 --> 00:51:21,339
identity one thing one archetype you are

1209
00:51:19,990 --> 00:51:23,979
more prone to exploitation the more

1210
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:26,500
diverse you are more chaotic you are and

1211
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:29,440
that is what India is we are

1212
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:31,420
quite robust all right on that note all

1213
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:33,609
the best and let's hope the elections go

1214
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:36,130
all safely and in a big applause for the

1215
00:51:33,609 --> 00:51:39,179
audience and the end the panelist

1216
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:39,179
[Applause]
