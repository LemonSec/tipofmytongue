the discussion is Clash of the Titans

64
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,180
two of the most prominent and important

65
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:19,220
roles emerging in the security industry

66
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,019
the CP or the chief privacy officer or

67
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:25,819
the DP or coming up in different

68
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:27,890
versions or the C so we will discuss you

69
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:31,099
know what's the future will the roles

70
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:33,619
much we want take over the other will

71
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:36,560
the reporting be higher for many of you

72
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,549
who will earn more and that's advantage

73
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,370
they can see some smiles on that

74
00:02:37,549 --> 00:02:41,900
perspective what does one need to do to

75
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,840
get there in terms of Education

76
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:45,670
awareness how does one sell to a seesaw

77
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,519
ncpo

78
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:51,500
so with that let's start with Manish

79
00:02:48,519 --> 00:02:54,319
Manas you've been in the armed forces

80
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:56,780
and then our seesaw and also a part of a

81
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,130
DP or role and updated privacy what's

82
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,950
your perspective can get mics to all

83
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:04,099
peace here with the Rhodes merge do you

84
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:06,018
see the seesaw actually migrating to the

85
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:08,540
BPO as a value at an upscale to his

86
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:15,410
career or do you see them different

87
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:17,480
parts sure so thanks Burgess and you

88
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,370
know hi everybody

89
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:22,640
let me just start by saying that change

90
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:26,060
is the only constant and we have seen a

91
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,488
huge amount of change in transition in

92
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:31,609
the way security has been handling the

93
00:03:28,489 --> 00:03:33,170
last you know 20 odd years and I think

94
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:35,030
currently the burning question is should

95
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,708
as see so in fact I'd read an article on

96
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:40,280
LinkedIn should a seesaw should also be

97
00:03:36,709 --> 00:03:42,579
the data privacy officer unfortunately

98
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,600
the answer is not so straightforward and

99
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:46,940
the reason why I say this is that

100
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:49,608
different industries have got different

101
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:52,970
concerns I'm sure all of you are aware

102
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:55,280
and for those who are not in the

103
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:58,910
financial sector the banking sector now

104
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,500
the seaso is no longer part of the CIO

105
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:02,930
team in fact reports to the chief risk

106
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,209
officer and this is something which is

107
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:06,859
unique to the banking sector this is not

108
00:04:05,209 --> 00:04:08,030
something which is there and the model

109
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:12,079
followed elsewhere yep

110
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:14,569
so definitely there is a case for one

111
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:16,100
side says that you know

112
00:04:14,569 --> 00:04:18,108
probably the seesaw should be the data

113
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,209
privacy officer and I want that side or

114
00:04:18,108 --> 00:04:23,210
you know so I'm actually I would say in

115
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:25,130
the current context because I've been

116
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:27,380
handling gdpr for my organization and

117
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:29,090
yeah as a global company I'm not sure

118
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,159
how many are aware Airtel is operating

119
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:33,710
out of 14 countries in Africa as an

120
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:35,240
Indian company we are very proud to

121
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:37,250
share that and that was you are playing

122
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:41,180
a part of a DP or seesaw or CPS role

123
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:44,900
true but see it's a learning journey the

124
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:46,520
whole gdpr itself has been a hugely

125
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:48,979
learning curve even for European

126
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,120
companies GDP our current currently

127
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:51,590
today is a guideline it's not a

128
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:53,690
certification there is nothing called an

129
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:56,840
I SMS equivalent certification of GDP

130
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:58,910
are right now going forward when you

131
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,739
talk about data privacy there are

132
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,620
compliance and there are legal

133
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:07,460
connotations to that so the question

134
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:10,160
here is that should the seesaw be the

135
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:14,349
data privacy officer in my opinion today

136
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:17,810
perhaps there is or could be a bit of a

137
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:20,000
conflict conflict of interest or overlap

138
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:22,280
yeah ocean as a prospect in the morning

139
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,430
so perhaps it could be a separate entity

140
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:29,150
in the organization who is part of the

141
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:31,610
regulatory or the legal entity supported

142
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:32,719
by various functions sure from another

143
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,300
perspective in the morning and you said

144
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:39,979
one the seesaw looks at the customer or

145
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:43,430
the company go ahead so the way we look

146
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:45,590
at it the transferwise is that at the

147
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:48,349
moment I'm the seesaw and the DPI all

148
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,909
right that's very unusual so I agree

149
00:05:48,349 --> 00:05:52,219
there's there is definitely a conflict

150
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,919
and the lives of these in your book so

151
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:55,490
it has to it has to that conflict has to

152
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:59,000
be managed

153
00:05:55,490 --> 00:06:01,490
right so the issues are around finding

154
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,039
someone that scene that's got the the

155
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:07,220
technical knowledge and the experience

156
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:09,050
and the right mindset to do it it

157
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,610
depends very much on the culture of the

158
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:12,169
company that you're in and the nature of

159
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,820
the company and so I am in finance but

160
00:06:12,169 --> 00:06:18,289
FinTech rather than banking

161
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:20,750
and for us we currently have me as the

162
00:06:18,289 --> 00:06:23,690
seaso and dpo and i have to wear two

163
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:26,990
hats in as much as as the sea so my job

164
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:28,090
is to protect the company as the DPI my

165
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:31,700
job is to protect

166
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:33,679
so and and that can conflict potentially

167
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:35,930
it hasn't yet opens I can honestly say

168
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,780
but we've had to put various levels of

169
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:41,840
oversight in there so if I was to make a

170
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:43,460
decision that I make that might have a

171
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,630
material effect on customers or the

172
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,729
company from a security or privacy

173
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:49,100
perspective is also kind of

174
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:51,080
double-checked by other peers in the

175
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,150
organization thanks Shannon do group

176
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,560
agree with this that a seesaw looks at

177
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:58,640
the company while the sepals the

178
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:01,790
customer is that a pure play a low first

179
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:03,440
pair I actually don't agree completely

180
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,960
with the fact that there is a conflict

181
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,330
of interest between DPO and Cicero so

182
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,849
there is no conflict I think that

183
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:12,590
conflict of interest is a myth because

184
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:14,330
that would be always confusion of

185
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:17,719
interest in many roles but these rolls

186
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:19,099
are walked together with some combatant

187
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,860
in control and that is the third of all

188
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:23,540
of us do every day in and day out so I

189
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,670
would rather think that there are a lot

190
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:27,200
of synergies between these two roles not

191
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:29,270
a protection of Fisher and this I was

192
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,760
security role combining these two roles

193
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:33,260
of this issues should go and a spare to

194
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,390
become BPO is a different question

195
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:38,960
altogether because I would just take two

196
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:42,740
minutes time I know when this role see

197
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,330
so came into the the the all of us this

198
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:45,800
kind of conference we started talking

199
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:48,020
about whether there should be a role

200
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:50,060
called c8 years back Jamie's that work

201
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:51,289
that was 10 10 to Elias before 15 years

202
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:54,350
before I remember you guys in this room

203
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:56,870
2003 I was deported by this or Bank of

204
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:59,210
India for a year to us to study the

205
00:07:56,870 --> 00:08:01,220
security practices of US and UK and

206
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:04,669
compare that with the banking industry I

207
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:06,680
first time hurt in Toms he saw in US and

208
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:09,650
UK and recommended that there has to be

209
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:11,300
a CEO role in the country in India so so

210
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:12,770
that was people are telling C so C so

211
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,690
also the seesaw role came to the

212
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:16,849
existent this all of you relate to

213
00:08:14,690 --> 00:08:18,920
ourself and many people may not relate

214
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:21,140
up with them pretty young so if you

215
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:23,120
relate to yourself you will find that

216
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,409
there are guys they were strong they

217
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,320
were really fighting among each other

218
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:28,610
and they are not Titans those days

219
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:30,500
fighting with each other to become C so

220
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:32,690
who all are fighting some people from

221
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,250
the business some people from the IP

222
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:36,380
some people from the disc management

223
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:37,909
they all were trying to fight whether

224
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,939
that can become C so they were trying to

225
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:41,718
speak security language those days these

226
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,009
talking virus there

227
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:45,110
talking farewells and all sort of things

228
00:08:43,009 --> 00:08:47,300
now finally what happened who came and

229
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:50,569
who became caesar's some of the IT firms

230
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:52,579
some of the business books very

231
00:08:50,569 --> 00:08:54,229
perceptible the people from the services

232
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:56,180
like Manish Chandra they became very

233
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:57,470
efficient see shows they all came and

234
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:02,329
became this issue it's a compliment

235
00:08:57,470 --> 00:09:06,519
money so so so so really really that

236
00:09:02,329 --> 00:09:12,819
time III came I became see so Occidental

237
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:15,560
I was I always wanted to become a CRO

238
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:17,180
because I came from business I was in

239
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,969
banking I was knowing what his

240
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,769
operational risk but I was young and the

241
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,439
young was a synonym for technology and I

242
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:26,860
was talking technology and I was talking

243
00:09:23,439 --> 00:09:30,980
bank that interested in me in security

244
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:33,139
to become security person so this is how

245
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:36,019
the things happen not Buddha the work

246
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:38,329
that who becomes CP or move become C so

247
00:09:36,019 --> 00:09:42,410
it all depends on the knowledge base

248
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:43,579
what what a CP you need sir I sigh

249
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:46,519
seriously thing you should rather

250
00:09:43,579 --> 00:09:48,680
particle in knowing that knowledge if

251
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:50,300
you look at this madam you know look at

252
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:52,519
this madam you know that Caesar privacy

253
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,829
professor but soon they got up to you

254
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:56,149
why does the PRT say that and what's of

255
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:57,769
knowledge he looks in all every

256
00:09:56,149 --> 00:10:00,259
tournament is most important than really

257
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:03,110
are sparing thank you sir thank you I

258
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:04,550
agree with the guy in fact I was just

259
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,309
telling you that I believe you should

260
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:09,349
focus on knowledge and you know many

261
00:10:07,309 --> 00:10:11,360
titles everything will follow it's like

262
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:15,470
you know an idiot all right Laxmi PJ I

263
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,600
you know so I was a lot vvt-i you so

264
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:20,089
whatever happens on that yeah yeah so so

265
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,910
like the girl says he is the accidental

266
00:10:20,089 --> 00:10:25,670
see so I am frankly the accidental dpo

267
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:28,040
I'm a lawyer by training by profession

268
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:31,809
for so many years and then I moved on to

269
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:36,170
leading compliances and gdpr happen and

270
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:38,120
so we had to you know go out we are a

271
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:40,639
global company and we have a huge

272
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:43,009
presence in Europe so we had to ensure

273
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:48,019
that you know globally complies with GDP

274
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:50,000
are so compliance and the sea so to

275
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:51,980
office teamed up and you know got

276
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,380
ourselves killed we went for classes we

277
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,710
learn

278
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:57,420
and then we realize that there is

279
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:59,700
according to us clear conflict of

280
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:03,410
interest in the role of a seesaw and

281
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:06,300
that of the DPO especially because one

282
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:07,709
it is a law that says that period so you

283
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,079
know there is no argument if the

284
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:12,960
Philippines law says that the ID and

285
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:15,390
InfoSec cannot be the dbo and gdpr also

286
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:18,270
says that very clearly but if you look

287
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:21,420
at it deeper the reason for it is that

288
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:24,180
if there is a flaw in your you know a

289
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:27,719
security system and you have to report

290
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:29,849
it obviously if you are the owner of

291
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,470
that system you are going to have a

292
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:33,930
little hesitation and how you want to

293
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:36,360
report it right it is the DPO who has

294
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:39,150
tools take a step back and say i will

295
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,510
call the spade a spade and he is like a

296
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,160
lawyer

297
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:43,080
we are the officers of the court you

298
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,790
know if I am standing there before even

299
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,250
I am trying to defend a customer a

300
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:49,770
client of mine I have to you know be

301
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:52,530
true to the law we have to be true to

302
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:55,230
the data subjects as DPO so if there has

303
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:57,209
been a breach or there has been a risk I

304
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:58,800
need to be sure that you know the data I

305
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:01,020
have contained we have worked with the

306
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,990
seesaw contained the breach but we have

307
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:06,150
to report it as this you know to the

308
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:08,400
data authority supervisory authority and

309
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:10,829
given that it is important to keep these

310
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,630
two as two separate functions so they

311
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:16,050
are I mean you had a perspective where

312
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:19,140
he said the seesaw looks at the company

313
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:22,439
the CPO says the customer Lugar you said

314
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:24,180
is all about skills she agreed monies

315
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:26,910
give a perspective of the OLAP and the

316
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:28,530
CP or getting a new prominence you've

317
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:30,719
been a hardcore seesaw of a telco and

318
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:34,470
other places and you see no last lecture

319
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,930
at nelq on your perspective it's a lot

320
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:39,390
to give a perspective on and but to be

321
00:12:36,930 --> 00:12:41,329
frank I think I'm not the accidental

322
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:48,900
Zito let's

323
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:54,060
like tripping know the exponential parts

324
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:56,790
like Oh said kept now I'm Macedo so high

325
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:58,770
that said did not happen in my case and

326
00:12:56,790 --> 00:12:59,939
I actually think with all due respect it

327
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:02,790
doesn't have to be a constant of

328
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,680
interest between your CEO and your C so

329
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:06,870
it doesn't have to be I worked really

330
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:11,040
closely with my privacy officer I would

331
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:13,410
never want her job because we do

332
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,880
completely different things she takes it

333
00:13:13,410 --> 00:13:17,610
from a very legal aspect she does indeed

334
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,950
do the reporting but I this is not my

335
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:22,320
ambition and not my knowledge background

336
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:24,420
and I think it's better that she does

337
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,370
that because honestly I had to do the

338
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,790
GDP or administrative stuff that she did

339
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:31,410
I would kill myself so I don't think

340
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:39,329
that this shall we have you kill

341
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:41,790
yourself is depressing depressing I mean

342
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:43,980
you think it's pressing to do the admin

343
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:48,329
for GDP are you should have kids to do

344
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:51,600
that yeah okay outsourcing is not my

345
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:55,770
point is that and look I think that for

346
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,460
a CEO a good CEO compliance is not your

347
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:59,280
job

348
00:13:56,460 --> 00:14:02,100
compliance is my Mouse's job compliance

349
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:04,350
is the basic most minimum level I think

350
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:08,280
the lesson that you're going to be an

351
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:10,080
idle compliance manager that then go if

352
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,400
you really want to do security as a CEO

353
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,500
it's up there

354
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,480
you know compliance is down here your

355
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,710
security goal should be up there but so

356
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:19,080
you should say of course I'm going to

357
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:21,240
comply with all the other data but you

358
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:23,550
know you really need security in order

359
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:26,340
to guarantee that privacy aspect so make

360
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:28,170
sure you find a good CEO who enjoys

361
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,970
doing what they do as much as you enjoy

362
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:31,800
doing what you do and we're all good

363
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,230
thanks yeah do that yeah I agree with

364
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:35,270
that you said our branches

365
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:37,670
you're very good very very good points

366
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:40,970
but I must tell you something like it

367
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:45,410
will be more difficult for you to manage

368
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:47,270
a GPU who doesn't understand security ji

369
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:49,189
speaking I am talking to you

370
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:51,829
it'll be really more difficult for you

371
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:53,870
to manage the DPO or comply to ADP or

372
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:55,490
who doesn't understand security rather

373
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:57,260
than taking that role and managing

374
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,550
compliance for yourself it will be

375
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:01,310
really difficult to trust me it will be

376
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:03,650
really difficult to comply to certain

377
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:05,290
things from a person who dictates you

378
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:08,180
without understanding what is security

379
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:10,430
so maybe I wasn't clear but the CPO is a

380
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,780
fully independent function and has

381
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,780
nothing to do with me reports through

382
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:15,589
legal I report to the CEO so on the very

383
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,020
important point

384
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:19,760
right as he said the see saw was part

385
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:22,760
first part of IT we all grew up like

386
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:26,300
that then the bank said you should

387
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:28,040
report outside to CRO and CEO the CP

388
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:31,520
also started as part of General Counsel

389
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:33,500
reporting but now reports the board will

390
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:36,350
that be a seat at the table

391
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,970
now that was nice I decided that yes the

392
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,860
de Pio does have to have a reporting

393
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:42,620
lines of the board yeah they have to be

394
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:44,180
able to approach at least a subset of

395
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:46,790
the both directly in order to fulfill

396
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:48,800
several see-saw regulator see sir see so

397
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:53,740
should have a seat inside without doubt

398
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:57,880
dpi I think there's a lot of there's

399
00:15:53,740 --> 00:16:01,100
it's not about how high the same is is

400
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:03,020
it's about a lot of people looking at

401
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,330
dpi was purely a regulatory thing yeah

402
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:06,560
and he shouldn't be if he's purely a

403
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:09,050
regulate everything like you said is

404
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:10,969
that's not very ambitious yeah just just

405
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:13,819
fulfilling the regulation it's like that

406
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,860
should be your lowest goal yeah and and

407
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:18,050
but I think a lot of people were getting

408
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,670
into the privacy side a lot of people

409
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:21,020
getting into the privacy side because

410
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,560
they think it's an instance II as a

411
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,660
table

412
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:26,390
it's like instance senior position that

413
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:29,480
the DPO doesn't have to be like a

414
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:31,430
director level person it can be it can

415
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,020
be someone further down in terms of

416
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,920
seniority in the organization as long as

417
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:39,050
they have the knowledge and the

418
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:41,479
responsibility I have a contrary view

419
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:44,019
and who has a seat at the table it's

420
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,519
going why did you are you know aligned

421
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:46,989
business and you're adding so much of

422
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,059
value you will make it to the seat of

423
00:16:46,989 --> 00:16:50,980
the table whether you're a CPA or DPO

424
00:16:49,059 --> 00:16:53,889
compliance you know see so it doesn't

425
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:55,600
matter if you are being perceived by the

426
00:16:53,889 --> 00:16:58,269
senior management that you're adding

427
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,279
value you'll be there so it's for each

428
00:16:58,269 --> 00:17:02,739
person to you know make his way up there

429
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:04,809
absolutely then you know saying that a

430
00:17:02,739 --> 00:17:07,600
dpo or a C so gets a seat at the table

431
00:17:04,809 --> 00:17:10,059
yeah yeah and he can't be or Theroux it

432
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:11,559
people you have a voice Punisher let me

433
00:17:10,059 --> 00:17:13,148
throw some spanner in the words i all

434
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:15,609
right at room yeah absolutely

435
00:17:13,148 --> 00:17:17,619
at room do saucepan a buddy at this

436
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:19,750
whole discussion just hear me out yeah

437
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:22,479
so I think it's extremely important

438
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:24,309
first is people who have been given a

439
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,679
designated role and responsibility know

440
00:17:24,309 --> 00:17:28,059
their job that's the most thing about

441
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:33,159
you thing yeah they need to know their

442
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:35,529
job accidental or otherwise it doesn't

443
00:17:33,159 --> 00:17:38,559
matter you got the job

444
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:40,360
shape up or ship out everything will

445
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:44,590
come from the forces right whatever

446
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:47,350
and the second thing is that there are

447
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:50,918
overlaps in jobs so which means that

448
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:53,049
today you cannot have a company's

449
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:56,289
privacy officer not really understanding

450
00:17:53,049 --> 00:17:59,440
even the basics of IT security all right

451
00:17:56,289 --> 00:18:01,059
okay and they have to basically you know

452
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,960
you come from a legal background you

453
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:03,820
could come from a business background

454
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:07,779
but you simply have to get on with it

455
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:10,990
and learn as a see so I would hate to

456
00:18:07,779 --> 00:18:13,779
get into legal and other you know other

457
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:16,779
issues I am very happy doing that but I

458
00:18:13,779 --> 00:18:20,230
would still have to take the effort to

459
00:18:16,779 --> 00:18:21,880
learn what data you know a company

460
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:23,529
previously officer company is data

461
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:26,260
privacy officer is doing because all

462
00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:28,080
have to work in synergy and the last

463
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:30,429
point I basically want to make is that

464
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:33,610
the conflict I mean there are companies

465
00:18:30,429 --> 00:18:35,770
where the CIO the seaso the CRO

466
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:38,740
everything all rolls into one correct

467
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:40,779
there is one single entity right so is

468
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,639
that convenience is that or is it

469
00:18:40,779 --> 00:18:44,770
because sauced collinear in size

470
00:18:42,639 --> 00:18:47,559
whatever but that's not a good model

471
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:50,110
going forward as we as we experience

472
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:52,870
convergence more of um business see

473
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:55,090
there was a time versus when IT used to

474
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:56,120
support business the times have changed

475
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:59,570
folks

476
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:02,029
I did drives business Mikey doesn't

477
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:05,299
support the pikey drives business now so

478
00:19:02,029 --> 00:19:08,330
a disruption in IT that can have very

479
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:10,549
serious I've got three out there I might

480
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:12,929
to do if you can please we won a

481
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:15,969
perspective on this

482
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:15,969
[Music]

483
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:25,580
[Music]

484
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:27,139
we are perspective on this over valid

485
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:29,720
points but I think you missing the

486
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:31,309
bigger picture first of all and you are

487
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,890
talking about different disciplines with

488
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:35,750
whole areas of specialization most

489
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:37,490
organizations need a team to operate not

490
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,559
the individuals so that's the first

491
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:43,309
point so as a team you need a seat you

492
00:19:39,559 --> 00:19:45,230
need a CE so CPA CRO to actually work

493
00:19:43,309 --> 00:19:49,460
together to make them function so they

494
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:50,539
are a team the fact of the matter is

495
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:55,190
that the world is getting far more

496
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:56,840
complex okay to the CPS point you

497
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:59,360
actually your area of expertise should

498
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:01,158
be the interpretation of law okay very

499
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:02,899
often the complexities interpretation is

500
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:05,120
what makes the EC so not do fully

501
00:20:02,899 --> 00:20:07,639
understand missions of compliance is a

502
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,199
very gray area in many many areas this

503
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,120
is where the CSIS tend to struggle the

504
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,659
gray areas of legal interpretation is

505
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,799
not the strength of the seesaw okay

506
00:20:13,659 --> 00:20:18,350
Ceaser's on the other hand understand

507
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:20,240
the implementation which most of the CPS

508
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,709
don't so this is the other problem of

509
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,970
technical implementation and change

510
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:24,429
which is required so you actually can

511
00:20:22,970 --> 00:20:26,539
work together whether you like it or not

512
00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:29,929
the third piece of this puzzle is the

513
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:32,000
risk aspect the CRO role often these

514
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:33,740
issues require multi-faceted views on

515
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,630
what's going on yet and data privacy

516
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:37,250
implication often has both the security

517
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,809
and business implications they have to

518
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:40,399
come together so you actually have to

519
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:44,330
take all those facets together when you

520
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:46,370
look at it okay to your point it is true

521
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:47,928
technology has changed massively the

522
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,820
landscape in terms of how boards of

523
00:20:47,929 --> 00:20:51,799
looking at business in the old days

524
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:53,779
technology was a supporting mechanism

525
00:20:51,799 --> 00:20:55,279
enabler today technology is the drive of

526
00:20:53,779 --> 00:20:56,179
what business is doing as you seeing

527
00:20:55,279 --> 00:20:57,830
what's going with the digital

528
00:20:56,179 --> 00:20:59,840
transformation and what you're gonna

529
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:03,020
find is that most boards are playing

530
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:04,820
catch-up on both how to use technology

531
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,168
to drive business understanding the

532
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,428
implications of what it means from a

533
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:09,890
security perspective as well as from

534
00:21:07,429 --> 00:21:12,649
data privacy perspective you just watch

535
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:14,980
the recent historical events most boards

536
00:21:12,649 --> 00:21:18,139
are asking can we have a Facebook moment

537
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:21,890
okay and they asked about the CP o and

538
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:24,320
the C so how are you managing it yeah we

539
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:25,789
all my guests okay and there's probably

540
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,830
a few more in this ecosystem which is

541
00:21:25,789 --> 00:21:29,330
you guys have been raised but it should

542
00:21:27,830 --> 00:21:30,889
that should be in that conversation as

543
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:31,789
well but at least those three who do you

544
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:34,490
share the question which we haven't

545
00:21:31,789 --> 00:21:37,279
raised happy to get that Josh you can

546
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:39,470
also pass in Europe if you look at C so

547
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:40,760
CP and zero or what we call second line

548
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,230
of defense those of you can come from

549
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:44,029
banking understand what I'm saying

550
00:21:42,230 --> 00:21:46,190
okay the third line of defense is not

551
00:21:44,029 --> 00:21:47,539
represented in this discussion this

552
00:21:46,190 --> 00:21:50,000
depends on the strength of your third

553
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:52,220
line of defense okay that's most other

554
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,600
functions don't get this okay they

555
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:55,549
should because they are the third line

556
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,870
of defense they play the oversight role

557
00:21:55,549 --> 00:22:01,519
on both the C source CP o and CRO roles

558
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:04,250
but you only have a culture of that in

559
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:05,659
the financial services industry meaning

560
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,549
industries are starting to move in that

561
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:08,210
direction but they not be it literally

562
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:09,799
not there yet

563
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:12,230
financial services probably one that's

564
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:14,120
most advanced thanks Jo perspective the

565
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:15,500
third line of defense is what I think we

566
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,418
do have a third line of defense so the

567
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,950
waive it depends again on your industry

568
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:21,230
and the referee the level of regulation

569
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:22,940
as well as the level of maturity in

570
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:24,980
order to determine whether or not it's

571
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:27,070
there I'll just give you an example my

572
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:29,750
organization in the context of

573
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:32,450
telecommunications in Europe the way

574
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:34,909
that we have had organized is seizo and

575
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:35,990
tpo are responsible for both getting the

576
00:22:34,909 --> 00:22:36,980
legal translation of all the

577
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:38,750
requirements were supposed to do

578
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:40,490
implementing them correctly through the

579
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:42,200
company indeed that's the first line of

580
00:22:40,490 --> 00:22:45,200
defense role the second line of defense

581
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:47,600
is a corporate compliance and risk

582
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,639
management role they are absolutely

583
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,379
there the question is whether they're

584
00:22:49,639 --> 00:22:53,178
actually adding anything or just taking

585
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:55,370
the information we give them and putting

586
00:22:53,179 --> 00:22:56,630
it in a nice report there's arguments

587
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:58,158
there I actually think it's a little bit

588
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:00,080
of which they try to sell

589
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:01,850
everyone and say look at this is there

590
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,549
the right we have to our jobs because

591
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:06,230
literally they take our data put it in a

592
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:07,670
pretty powerpoint and then sell it back

593
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:10,820
as look what I found out

594
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:12,530
so is that familiar with others so and

595
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:14,240
then our third line of defense which I

596
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:16,310
actually think is more of a second line

597
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:18,290
because of purely their quality is our

598
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:20,320
audit team so our internal audit

599
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:23,629
combined with our external audit

600
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:28,159
actually do some of the checks and

601
00:23:23,630 --> 00:23:30,200
balances over the primary privacy as

602
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:33,380
well as security role and they actually

603
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,640
offer us the ability to do a check on

604
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,950
our implementation and our

605
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:40,370
interpretation of compliance and

606
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:42,890
everything else buddy does it happen

607
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:46,489
often in terms of Anita happens I mean

608
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:48,050
the first point second line third line

609
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:52,010
it but it was there in all the

610
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:54,320
industries in fact I don't have anything

611
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:57,260
to add to what she has told she has told

612
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,389
perfectly that all three roles what we

613
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:03,440
are talking the CPU are all this hero

614
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:05,870
role not zero they the seesaw role they

615
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,060
are on the first line of defense the CRO

616
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:10,429
is mostly on the second line of defense

617
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:12,980
and definitely the third line of defense

618
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:15,920
is our pure play as you dance guys this

619
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:18,380
audit guys so different point of view I

620
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,850
think if you know disagreement with

621
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,290
anything anybody has said and that was a

622
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:23,419
very valid point coming up retiring

623
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:25,670
every single good boots to the trees a

624
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:30,050
bit higher mica and which is the focus

625
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:32,810
the focus is on protecting data I think

626
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:33,980
the focus whose job is there yeah whose

627
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:36,860
job is there I think it's everybody's

628
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:38,630
song at the end of the day I brought it

629
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,129
out correctly and that's what you know I

630
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:42,830
was also at the end of the day it's

631
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:45,410
teamwork everybody has to do their bit

632
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:48,220
but then in a company they all have to

633
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:51,230
basically come together as a team to

634
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:52,610
understand the risks who put and you

635
00:24:51,230 --> 00:24:53,960
could be compliant and in fact she

636
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:55,760
brought it out very correctly you could

637
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:57,920
be compliant but you not need not

638
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,540
necessarily be sick which is why

639
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:02,270
cybersecurity needs to be where

640
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:05,120
compliance is a industry-specific

641
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:06,530
requirement right there are some basic

642
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,270
fundamental issues which everybody has

643
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:10,670
to do irrespective of you know let's say

644
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:13,160
my SMS but there are a lot of industry

645
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:15,380
segments compliance requirements for

646
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:17,090
various reasons but the point I'm trying

647
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,890
to make is you could be compliant but

648
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:20,370
you need not necessarily be secure

649
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:23,010
which is why ID security

650
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:25,260
is extremely odd but bottom line is you

651
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:27,990
have to protect the user the device and

652
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:30,679
the data the focus is on data and it

653
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:33,630
doesn't really matter what organization

654
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:35,789
what organization is specific to a

655
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:38,340
particular company I think one shouldn't

656
00:25:35,789 --> 00:25:39,900
drop the ball finally at the end of the

657
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:42,090
day there is a large amount of customer

658
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:43,669
data the world is converging the world

659
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:47,010
is moving towards a very highly

660
00:25:43,669 --> 00:25:53,480
digitized ecosystem and it's extremely

661
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:55,679
important to protect customer data like

662
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:58,610
the reality of what's happening in the

663
00:25:55,679 --> 00:26:00,960
ground so the GDP is coming a lot of

664
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:03,029
initiative in the data protection coming

665
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,679
and that is no formalized data

666
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:06,809
protection role which is defined in many

667
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:08,399
organizations somewhere it is given to

668
00:26:06,809 --> 00:26:10,320
seashore somewhere it is not given to

669
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:11,549
see show but what would happen if that

670
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,100
is something happens god forbid

671
00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:16,860
something happened whose name is right

672
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,840
so what would happen is definitely the

673
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:22,260
Caesars will be asked to explain that

674
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:25,199
why did this thing happen so sooner or

675
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:26,760
later it is always better to to log that

676
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,159
domain to understand what is happening

677
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:31,890
in data protection because Caesars role

678
00:26:29,159 --> 00:26:34,710
has become popular and it has become

679
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:36,870
very strategic and anything happening

680
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:38,850
happening to data see data security

681
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:41,279
really a privacy related thing or

682
00:26:38,850 --> 00:26:42,990
anything anything I am sure see so

683
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,980
cannot raise their hand telling that I

684
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:45,299
am NOT responsible

685
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:47,250
it is a privacy rule which is not

686
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:49,590
assigned to me that is what I don't know

687
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:51,630
it it is impossible to do that so that

688
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,168
is why who has that role that's a

689
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:53,610
different thing

690
00:26:52,169 --> 00:26:55,529
who has that gap that's a different

691
00:26:53,610 --> 00:26:58,500
thing I would personally think that all

692
00:26:55,529 --> 00:27:01,140
see source should definitely one of

693
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,299
their skill on the privacy side because

694
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,549
this is coming either coming to get that

695
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:07,529
cap or coming to actively collaborate

696
00:27:05,549 --> 00:27:09,899
with the privacy office or get your here

697
00:27:07,529 --> 00:27:11,669
so so when we are talking of you know

698
00:27:09,899 --> 00:27:14,189
bigger and bigger data which is a new

699
00:27:11,669 --> 00:27:16,710
oil so when you talk of big data there

700
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:19,440
are three you know sides it's like a

701
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:21,809
triangle one is transparency security

702
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,299
and privacy and it's very important to

703
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:26,760
balance all the three and these are

704
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:28,620
obviously not mutually independent but

705
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,669
they have to work together you know it

706
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,228
again comes back

707
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:33,269
this so if we will draw three circles

708
00:27:31,229 --> 00:27:35,009
then there will be one meeting

709
00:27:33,269 --> 00:27:36,989
intersection over there where you know

710
00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:39,269
the three of them and it's important to

711
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:41,489
balance them off you have to look at the

712
00:27:39,269 --> 00:27:43,049
rights of the data subject at the same

713
00:27:41,489 --> 00:27:45,779
time you need to look at how you want to

714
00:27:43,049 --> 00:27:48,749
protect your company and your data and

715
00:27:45,779 --> 00:27:50,279
to what extent we need transparency so

716
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:51,779
when we look at all of this together I

717
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:54,719
guess you know we all have to work

718
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:57,059
together and ensure that all these

719
00:27:54,719 --> 00:28:01,950
rights are balanced and that is you know

720
00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:10,769
where the queen will veto okay the

721
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:14,389
question all right go ahead yeah my name

722
00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:19,200
is because I'm at the Vodafone heading

723
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:21,718
yeah yeah I'm adding these cybersecurity

724
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:25,379
shared services in India for quota for

725
00:28:21,719 --> 00:28:27,329
globally I think it's a bit of a

726
00:28:25,379 --> 00:28:29,158
cultural shift that you see depending on

727
00:28:27,329 --> 00:28:31,499
which type of the company you end up in

728
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:33,359
so I've been in the industry for 20

729
00:28:31,499 --> 00:28:34,709
years to me I think now when you see

730
00:28:33,359 --> 00:28:38,428
there will be three sets of companies

731
00:28:34,709 --> 00:28:41,479
types one you know who just to basic

732
00:28:38,429 --> 00:28:45,139
check in the box regulatory compliance

733
00:28:41,479 --> 00:28:47,489
second who do regulatory compliance and

734
00:28:45,139 --> 00:28:50,399
you know they have increasing sense of

735
00:28:47,489 --> 00:28:53,190
security so they do security as well but

736
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:56,369
the third one which is if you've got a

737
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:58,169
preached right if you've really really

738
00:28:56,369 --> 00:29:01,049
got breached whether you made it public

739
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:03,379
you didn't you don't know but and you

740
00:29:01,049 --> 00:29:06,989
would see the focus of the organization

741
00:29:03,379 --> 00:29:09,718
shift significantly from compliance to

742
00:29:06,989 --> 00:29:12,619
hot or cyber security if you're in the

743
00:29:09,719 --> 00:29:16,169
third one right so to me I think it's

744
00:29:12,619 --> 00:29:18,779
coexistence but who's got a bigger

745
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:21,869
circle in the intersection and I think

746
00:29:18,779 --> 00:29:23,399
that shift is when they're talking about

747
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:24,329
the culture of the organization yeah

748
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:27,629
it's a nice

749
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:29,820
that's fundamentals all of the questions

750
00:29:27,629 --> 00:29:32,879
that we mentioned up a Jedi is is the

751
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:36,329
culture so I was Santa purchase earlier

752
00:29:32,879 --> 00:29:38,549
if if I had been asked to be bossy so

753
00:29:36,329 --> 00:29:40,469
and dpo at any of my previous roles any

754
00:29:38,549 --> 00:29:42,610
job any company I worked for before Hara

755
00:29:40,469 --> 00:29:45,370
said no and why is that

756
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:47,620
any reason I say yes to doing it in

757
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:54,729
Turin tears laughs interims Mike when

758
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:56,409
I'm hiring by the way 15 rate the only

759
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,640
reason I agreed to take on the DPI role

760
00:29:56,410 --> 00:30:00,130
while we got through the preparations

761
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,450
for gdpr and everything was because of

762
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:03,220
the culture of the organization the

763
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:05,520
organization is extremely customer

764
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:08,950
focused extremely transparency focused

765
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,780
and also being a FinTech it's also

766
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:12,700
massively security focused because if we

767
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:14,678
have a security incident at the stage of

768
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:17,290
development of our organization now is

769
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:19,660
game over I mean it would literally end

770
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:20,950
our business overnight just because of

771
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,809
the nature of the organization and

772
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:26,140
maturity of the organization's gear more

773
00:30:22,809 --> 00:30:27,490
money Sivaji sauce is it seesaw snake on

774
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:30,130
the line or cpos neck on the line

775
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:33,220
finally all of them what would not be

776
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:35,260
sacked or would what be sacked no nice

777
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:36,400
to test two questions who would be

778
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:44,799
sacked and who would go to prison

779
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:46,450
there's two different points so what I

780
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:48,400
want to say is when the company does

781
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:52,000
well in security

782
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:54,880
it's the businesses success we all agree

783
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,770
when they do great yeah business the

784
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:58,630
business learned how to figure out

785
00:30:56,770 --> 00:31:01,960
security properly when the company

786
00:30:58,630 --> 00:31:04,600
fuck's up then we all know whose fault

787
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,340
it is whose fault is it the CISOs falls

788
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:09,340
right get the Caesar the hell out of

789
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:11,678
here so the clue is I know by the way

790
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:14,678
the Vodafone Seto and I've been to your

791
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,870
G sock and everything and and yours he's

792
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:18,640
awesome she's really cool but I can tell

793
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:20,620
you that if there is like a really

794
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:22,929
serious breach then we all know that

795
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:25,899
she's out in five seconds you know what

796
00:31:22,929 --> 00:31:29,440
see so stands for career is so over oh

797
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:31,660
yeah I want to stick her with that

798
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,820
anyone who can make a sticker with that

799
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:35,350
and you wouldn't get I really would like

800
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,760
to see you sick who's gonna make the

801
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:40,000
sticker I think we should have this

802
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:44,220
sticker or a t-shirt a sticker or a

803
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,220
t-shirt I think this is a goal yeah okay

804
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:53,140
Gustavo sue person who's making the line

805
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:55,960
I mean I love that but I don't very

806
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:58,990
scary cool so the only thing which says

807
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:01,900
I want to play is like it's a look at

808
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:06,120
70% of the organizations they have very

809
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:09,760
fluid privacy role so it all depends on

810
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:12,939
the convenience and who is Kara for - OH

811
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:16,930
- Jen so because then you can afford to

812
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:22,420
go to jail I like that it should be a

813
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:24,940
special premium insurance always always

814
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:26,830
today see so I have realized it because

815
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:29,500
if that is anything happen which is

816
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:30,850
anything get it to data and only that in

817
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,500
my body will play Mike and Mike they're

818
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:35,760
not that somebody would blame us we

819
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:35,760
think that it is our responsibility

820
00:32:39,570 --> 00:32:45,389
there is fraud or something you know

821
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:45,390
mattified intent I think that should be

822
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:51,760
obvious to jail but by the way on a

823
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:54,190
serious note on the Indian law that's

824
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,590
been provisioned Mike's on the gdpr

825
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:59,170
it's a fine it's a very serious fine in

826
00:32:56,590 --> 00:33:01,330
the Indian data privacy draft law there

827
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:03,280
is a punitive measure which can

828
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:04,540
translate into something like two years

829
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:10,030
or thing three at the point there's

830
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:12,399
quite a few slides rule a statutory rule

831
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:19,180
and that is a sort of immunity the DPO

832
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:20,830
is not the person because you're not the

833
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:24,400
one who's implementing it but you are

834
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:26,470
supposed to be enough we had this

835
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,610
discussion when when we were looking at

836
00:33:26,470 --> 00:33:29,530
how we were gonna handle this whole

837
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:32,830
thing I had a very long discussion with

838
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:35,560
the CEO and made it quite clear to him

839
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:37,419
that if it hits the fan it's him that

840
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:40,030
goes to jail you know

841
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:42,450
the HP case it was to see you who took

842
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:44,860
the brand you know let us assume okay

843
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:46,960
interesting comments but ultimately this

844
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:48,459
comes back to company law if you look at

845
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,660
whose fight usually duty it is to

846
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,980
actually ensure that all of this is

847
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,559
actually going in the right direction is

848
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:55,840
actually the board's okay typically the

849
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:56,830
board if it's done is job properties

850
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,110
probably delegated the authority

851
00:33:56,830 --> 00:34:01,720
promptly to whoever whether that be the

852
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:03,969
CPO except for and I've been in this

853
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:07,690
position where statute so I actually

854
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:10,780
saying hunter Bob has the CP o chin in

855
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:13,389
Europe was actually changing in this

856
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:14,200
data that direction however but I think

857
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:17,200
you guys are missing the big picture

858
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:19,178
here the focus is being if effectively

859
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,589
focused on the data actually the bigger

860
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:22,960
risk is not the data is actually the

861
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:24,820
reputation what's happening is the shift

862
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,199
is been moving from the focus on the

863
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:28,450
data protection aspects to the

864
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:30,668
reputation loss aspects those are the

865
00:34:28,449 --> 00:34:32,168
bigger hits fines are catching up

866
00:34:30,668 --> 00:34:34,089
yes we're now starting to have two five

867
00:34:32,168 --> 00:34:35,408
percent of turnover as a catch up to

868
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:35,679
what has been happening in last fifteen

869
00:34:35,409 --> 00:34:37,840
years

870
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,940
but what really hits business is the

871
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:42,159
most is the loss of reputation and

872
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:43,929
that's where the business has to step in

873
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,700
and really understand because usually

874
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:48,159
way to your point where things really

875
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:50,618
get screwed up it's when the business

876
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:52,810
the CP on seesaw don't actually stand up

877
00:34:50,619 --> 00:34:55,780
to business scenarios which actually go

878
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:58,270
against the ethical use of data okay

879
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:00,430
that's where the problem really starts

880
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:01,840
and it's not a CPA or Caesar

881
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,950
conversation it's actually a board

882
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:06,970
discussion which is not happening

883
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:08,529
alright so what you starting to see what

884
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:12,040
I starting to see is discussions at

885
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:13,720
board level rather but as a combination

886
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,460
of three things yes all the meeting a

887
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,839
minimal compliance requirements yes from

888
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:19,750
a data privacy yes we have all the

889
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:21,850
mechanisms that law requires us fine are

890
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:23,560
we meeting all the security requirements

891
00:35:21,850 --> 00:35:26,680
that are requirement yes we have all of

892
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:28,240
that okay but what are we doing to

893
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:30,250
actually anticipate what's gonna hit us

894
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:32,529
from a reputational perspective he's

895
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:34,750
currently the biggest gap and that's we

896
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:36,790
border this this scariest because they

897
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:40,270
have no idea how to respond they keep

898
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:42,550
asking in facebook was compliant with

899
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:44,230
laws yes correct they had all the

900
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:46,330
security measures in place the latest

901
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:47,650
security they got hammered on the

902
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:49,660
business side when I started to lose

903
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:50,370
Yahoo Yahoo as well

904
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,930
Yahoo

905
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:56,109
[Music]

906
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:58,029
Equifax Yahoo did not have their

907
00:35:56,110 --> 00:36:00,160
security on order that is not true

908
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:03,430
before Verizon bought Yahoo they were

909
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,200
breached because of actual huge misses

910
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:06,399
is security security so they did not

911
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:09,129
have it okay I agree

912
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:12,250
Yahoo had yahoo wasn't wasn't wasn't was

913
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:14,920
more of a inadequate security in place

914
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:16,780
as against in inappropriate data sharing

915
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:19,119
but the point I'm trying to make is that

916
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:21,670
it doesn't really matter you could share

917
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:23,380
data inappropriately or you could lose

918
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:25,030
data because of a technical glitch it

919
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:26,619
will impact your brand and they see I do

920
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:27,550
which most of these discussions happen

921
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:29,410
up in court

922
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:31,900
around the discussion of Duque whether

923
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:34,240
due care has been taken with regards to

924
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:35,950
both their security and their privacy so

925
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,118
in the court of law this discussion gets

926
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:38,290
very interesting but usually most

927
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:40,480
corporates get away with the fact that

928
00:36:38,290 --> 00:36:42,100
can demonstrate that they've taken some

929
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:43,930
level of Duque in terms of what they

930
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:46,060
were doing the thing that they can't

931
00:36:43,930 --> 00:36:47,680
protect themselves against is the

932
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:49,119
reputational damage this is not just

933
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,799
about the data it's about the reputation

934
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:53,170
and that's where boards are actually

935
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,050
most concerned about I think that

936
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:59,140
actually is like the growth cycle of a

937
00:36:56,050 --> 00:37:01,060
company you find that in the early days

938
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:02,350
reputation is really important to the

939
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,730
board reputation is everything because

940
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:04,960
you're in that growth phase and if you

941
00:37:03,730 --> 00:37:07,630
lose your reputation you're not going to

942
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,490
grow and then you reach that point like

943
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:11,320
a plateau where you're growing nicely

944
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:14,259
and like maybe you're heading towards

945
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:16,420
IPO and then still reputation is great

946
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:18,160
but then you go post IPO and then it's

947
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:20,940
all about the shareholders it's all

948
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:23,200
about making the money whatever sort of

949
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:25,270
funky vision you may have had might go

950
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,279
out the window and that's where I think

951
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:30,609
some companies start to wane on that

952
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,960
reputational risk and keeping that front

953
00:37:30,609 --> 00:37:33,369
and center in front of the board is very

954
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:37,900
much a joint thing as you say whether

955
00:37:33,369 --> 00:37:40,359
the CR OS c so DPI that's and that's a

956
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:42,010
discussion that is very hard to keep at

957
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:45,250
the top table once you in a position

958
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:47,260
where it's like shareholders they they

959
00:37:45,250 --> 00:37:48,700
want to see the numbers they don't want

960
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,990
to see the detail and they don't

961
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,520
understand that that is a detail that

962
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:52,990
can get lost easily

963
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:54,430
I flipped gears and I was talking to a

964
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:56,200
few people last night and asked them

965
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:58,899
what would you I want to remove from the

966
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,970
panel and many of the people out here

967
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:02,830
may not become a seesaw or a CPU a few

968
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:05,109
of them may become a seesaw but two

969
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:07,970
questions has asked who owns more

970
00:38:05,109 --> 00:38:10,279
hahahaha your views I think you said DP

971
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:11,959
was the hottest thing so tell something

972
00:38:10,279 --> 00:38:14,059
which said who are the more futures I

973
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:16,160
think I must tell think of the young

974
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:19,359
people was hitting you should you guys

975
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:22,399
would have come to the front benches so

976
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:25,609
so who thought yon moron who is yelling

977
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:27,289
more if we're really concentrating on

978
00:38:25,609 --> 00:38:27,529
that you will miss the forest for the

979
00:38:27,289 --> 00:38:29,809
trees

980
00:38:27,529 --> 00:38:32,059
absolutely you'll I still remember the

981
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:35,000
quote of a land border they are still

982
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:37,309
exhausted and captain he told one

983
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:39,170
sentence that concentrate on drones and

984
00:38:37,309 --> 00:38:40,730
US Mint will follow so if you

985
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:43,369
concentrate on investment Rhonda will

986
00:38:40,730 --> 00:38:46,910
never follow so you only concentrate on

987
00:38:43,369 --> 00:38:48,170
the scale today skill today with this

988
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:49,910
skill which you are really hearing

989
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:52,730
hybrids before nobody was knowing that

990
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:55,190
that can be a skill so what's the result

991
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:57,260
you got it what skills the skills is

992
00:38:55,190 --> 00:39:00,680
like know what usable for you people's

993
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:03,980
guilty skills of machine learning skills

994
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:06,259
of artificial intelligence skills of

995
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:09,259
privacy requirement compressed AC so I

996
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:11,329
don't agree with her madam that she so

997
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:13,579
cannot tell that it is compliance it's

998
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:16,190
run not mine role fifty percent of C so

999
00:39:13,579 --> 00:39:17,720
storage compliance only fifty percent an

1000
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:19,369
accomplice doesn't mean only let the

1001
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,500
regulatory and legal confluence there

1002
00:39:19,369 --> 00:39:23,180
are lot of components in might security

1003
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:27,289
policy adherence to regular the policy

1004
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:29,210
is a compliance requirement yeah I think

1005
00:39:27,289 --> 00:39:31,730
as a viewpoint on that so no I don't

1006
00:39:29,210 --> 00:39:34,190
have a new point and corrected yes I

1007
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:35,960
have a simple question so I agree more

1008
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:37,670
than with all due regard to all of you

1009
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:38,930
but each enter who has a question that

1010
00:39:37,670 --> 00:39:40,130
you know ultimately it's a loss of

1011
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:41,629
credibility for the organisation

1012
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:44,750
reputation we have a loss of reputation

1013
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:47,539
so why don't we have some kind of a

1014
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:50,599
uniform platform or uniform thought

1015
00:39:47,539 --> 00:39:53,440
process where C so and dpo should have

1016
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:56,390
the equal accountability and the major

1017
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,890
responsibility lies with the CRO I mean

1018
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:59,750
something like that otherwise this

1019
00:39:57,890 --> 00:40:01,819
debate is not going to end I mean no we

1020
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:03,049
will continue debate over the years also

1021
00:40:01,819 --> 00:40:04,880
who is going to be more powerful who's

1022
00:40:03,049 --> 00:40:07,520
going to be key decision maker and was

1023
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,980
that more powerful I think I

1024
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:11,900
I think let's rise above that answering

1025
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:16,579
to your first question and particularly

1026
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:18,289
the 101 is more absolutely I think you

1027
00:40:16,579 --> 00:40:22,069
should pursue what you feel passionate

1028
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:24,740
about and then do a bloody good job of

1029
00:40:22,069 --> 00:40:27,079
it it doesn't matter whether it is a

1030
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:30,589
seesaw job or the CRO it's got nothing

1031
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:33,200
to do with damn IT do pursue you want to

1032
00:40:30,589 --> 00:40:35,808
pursue art pursue art pursue your dreams

1033
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,399
pursue your passion and you know at

1034
00:40:35,809 --> 00:40:39,440
times like steaks you all directions

1035
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,270
which are out of your control pursue

1036
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:43,160
your passion and success will chase you

1037
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:45,200
that's the only point just to answer a

1038
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,640
gentleman's question just just to answer

1039
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,828
it just to add something whatever you

1040
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:52,490
are told you have rightly told rightly

1041
00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:55,549
ask the question sir in fact if you look

1042
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:57,799
at the largest bank of this country with

1043
00:40:55,549 --> 00:40:59,599
the largest bank in this country HDS

1044
00:40:57,799 --> 00:41:02,270
State Bank of India with the CEO of

1045
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:03,770
Third Bank of India is there any role

1046
00:41:02,270 --> 00:41:05,809
called CRO instead Bank of India the

1047
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:09,020
managing director is nominated as these

1048
00:41:05,809 --> 00:41:10,700
designated as the CRO the managing

1049
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:12,349
director of Bank of India is always

1050
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,740
designated as this year of tech Bank of

1051
00:41:12,349 --> 00:41:15,020
India

1052
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:17,000
so CRO is responsible both for the

1053
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:18,440
privacy security and all sort of things

1054
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,390
which is related to this

1055
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:22,220
that's what exactly equal yeah so that's

1056
00:41:20,390 --> 00:41:24,589
applicant for the larger organization

1057
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:26,629
mr. Tiwari just said that you know there

1058
00:41:24,589 --> 00:41:29,359
are smaller I think you said that there

1059
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:30,890
are smaller organisation so one person

1060
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:33,589
is playing multiple roles like he's

1061
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:35,960
playing the CRO cease or one man ami

1062
00:41:33,589 --> 00:41:37,220
one-man-army right or one woman nah yeah

1063
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,990
but for the larger organization the

1064
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:42,109
example what is a lighter note you are

1065
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:44,359
mentioning that the BPO and guys in five

1066
00:41:42,109 --> 00:41:47,509
years experience in London there's a hot

1067
00:41:44,359 --> 00:41:48,619
job yeah you say who's gonna burn the

1068
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:50,000
mouse that the guard is gonna run the

1069
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:52,279
mouse is the goddess in a much demand

1070
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:53,480
and the problem is is I agree with you

1071
00:41:52,279 --> 00:41:54,890
totally you do it you're passionate

1072
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,200
about if you're gonna chase the money

1073
00:41:54,890 --> 00:41:58,520
you're gonna do a lousy job because if

1074
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:01,160
you you're worried about is the money

1075
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:03,589
and not a passion of the job then yeah

1076
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:07,308
you you might be adequate for a while

1077
00:42:03,589 --> 00:42:09,170
and then you whine and you yeah it's not

1078
00:42:07,309 --> 00:42:12,529
a way today at the moment the hot

1079
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:14,000
property in in London is dpi everyone

1080
00:42:12,529 --> 00:42:15,109
wants to be a dpi because that's where

1081
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:17,210
all the big numbers are at the moment

1082
00:42:15,109 --> 00:42:19,920
because everyone has to have a deep Iago

1083
00:42:17,210 --> 00:42:23,160
oh GDP I've got a higher at a PR

1084
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:25,680
and so so right now do you guys but late

1085
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:27,839
5 10 years ago it was exactly the same

1086
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,410
we see size 5 there was that were

1087
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:32,609
talking I'd follow entry-level DPO in UK

1088
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:35,220
it won't be anything it can be I mean

1089
00:42:32,609 --> 00:42:36,598
you look at if you just Google for dpi

1090
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:39,149
rolls in in London now you'll see

1091
00:42:36,599 --> 00:42:41,789
everything from 50,000 to 200,000 pounds

1092
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:42,779
for an entry-level when I own a faint

1093
00:42:41,789 --> 00:42:45,000
really evolved she's gonna be like

1094
00:42:42,779 --> 00:42:47,010
buddies but the others give you or 2 5

1095
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,190
10 years experience yeah the other thing

1096
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:53,640
is the probably 70,000 something like

1097
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:55,500
that but it's but it depends on it

1098
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,970
depends on so many variables though it's

1099
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:58,440
not just how experienced you are or

1100
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:59,519
anything depends on the industry it

1101
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:02,369
depends on the size of the company

1102
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:03,959
depends on are you gonna be on your own

1103
00:43:02,369 --> 00:43:06,960
you're gonna be managing a team of 25

1104
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:08,369
you know it's there's so so many

1105
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:09,779
variables you can't just put a number on

1106
00:43:08,369 --> 00:43:11,670
it so what will give that profile the

1107
00:43:09,779 --> 00:43:17,250
pipe here and what will be that profile

1108
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:18,990
in terms of just doing the 5 years

1109
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:20,730
experience what was I alone in five

1110
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:28,618
years to become eligible forever the

1111
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:30,299
furture works actively in privacy say so

1112
00:43:28,619 --> 00:43:33,200
in the UK we had the title Protection

1113
00:43:30,299 --> 00:43:36,180
Act 1990 I is the the previous

1114
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:38,009
legislation totally different to GDP are

1115
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,899
but the difference is if you were

1116
00:43:38,009 --> 00:43:43,019
working in that arena ten years ago or

1117
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:43,920
five years ago then you've spent five

1118
00:43:43,019 --> 00:43:46,000
years ago you've spent your entire

1119
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:49,540
career basically preparing for GDP are

1120
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,540
[Laughter]

1121
00:43:49,730 --> 00:43:54,720
no I you know I think it's look I I

1122
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:56,759
agree with the sentiment of do what you

1123
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,500
love figure it out later

1124
00:43:56,759 --> 00:44:01,650
what you need to earn to do your thing

1125
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:04,319
but you know the I think the salaries a

1126
00:44:01,650 --> 00:44:07,769
little bit lower in the EU but that's

1127
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:09,299
because we don't have brexit so don't

1128
00:44:07,769 --> 00:44:10,819
worry a senator he's gonna crash big

1129
00:44:09,299 --> 00:44:23,779
time

1130
00:44:10,819 --> 00:44:27,450
so yeah software exept Excel is a crash

1131
00:44:23,779 --> 00:44:28,740
all right hi I had a slightly contrary

1132
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:31,439
and view pine and bear with me on this

1133
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:33,720
right on the reputation with impact on

1134
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:38,609
reputation now I'll give you two

1135
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:40,919
examples one is Equifax the share price

1136
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:43,589
of Equifax has clawed back most of the

1137
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:45,650
losses that it had taken you know back

1138
00:44:43,589 --> 00:44:50,190
when the breach was reported initially

1139
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:51,960
second is Amato in India that is another

1140
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:54,509
company which God breached which had a

1141
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:55,859
reputation loss so to speak but I I

1142
00:44:54,509 --> 00:44:59,009
don't think anybody is talking about

1143
00:44:55,859 --> 00:45:00,990
reputation loss right now so is the my

1144
00:44:59,009 --> 00:45:03,960
question is is the impact of your own

1145
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:06,390
reputation overstated now it depends on

1146
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:08,490
the this if the company can absorb that

1147
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:11,009
hey that's fine if it's a young company

1148
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:13,470
that's like still in the growth stage

1149
00:45:11,009 --> 00:45:15,900
then is every likelihood you won't

1150
00:45:13,470 --> 00:45:17,759
survive that impacts where is like these

1151
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:19,380
becomes I mean look at target targets

1152
00:45:17,759 --> 00:45:22,619
share price is higher than ever I think

1153
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:24,109
you know they they they were like they

1154
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:30,299
were the original big massive breach

1155
00:45:24,109 --> 00:45:32,670
that okay now Rodell can I answer your

1156
00:45:30,299 --> 00:45:35,038
questions like look at the wake effects

1157
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:37,799
man is the breach if they actually

1158
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:39,989
change transform the adversity in

1159
00:45:37,799 --> 00:45:42,119
Twitter advantage so look at the way

1160
00:45:39,989 --> 00:45:43,890
this you okay man bored and told

1161
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:45,839
everybody that is we are priests and

1162
00:45:43,890 --> 00:45:47,759
this is what we are going to pick up to

1163
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:50,308
make sure that we don't get such kind of

1164
00:45:47,759 --> 00:45:51,690
incident again the kind of measures

1165
00:45:50,309 --> 00:45:53,609
which are they have taken is the example

1166
00:45:51,690 --> 00:45:55,049
array we want quote that this is the

1167
00:45:53,609 --> 00:45:56,880
kind of measure which signature

1168
00:45:55,049 --> 00:45:59,369
companies who take that has gone in

1169
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:02,579
favor of them and that the share price

1170
00:45:59,369 --> 00:46:04,650
has gone up and they have done well even

1171
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:08,190
in the case of India right RSA look at

1172
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:10,529
RSA today the RSA breach happened it

1173
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:13,259
actually everybody thought that the

1174
00:46:10,529 --> 00:46:15,269
company is gone and then they have again

1175
00:46:13,259 --> 00:46:17,400
I was a customer of RSA I got to bear

1176
00:46:15,269 --> 00:46:19,379
later from this you of RSA telling that

1177
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:20,880
hey who you are breached and we have

1178
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:23,099
acquired this company to take care of

1179
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:24,190
such things such a beautiful letter this

1180
00:46:23,099 --> 00:46:26,589
you heard himself

1181
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:28,539
so this is this is the way I think once

1182
00:46:26,589 --> 00:46:30,759
repetition loss is not always reputation

1183
00:46:28,539 --> 00:46:34,180
loss you have to come over there the

1184
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:36,460
question when is your vacation

1185
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:41,740
kantham IQR and at least one day and one

1186
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:44,230
you last two and then I suppose so who

1187
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:58,390
should hack you avoided security

1188
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:59,369
researcher or any PD sponsor what was

1189
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:02,558
your question again

1190
00:46:59,369 --> 00:47:06,940
should hack you who stole my food

1191
00:47:02,559 --> 00:47:09,780
hackers what needs to be done is it that

1192
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:11,710
responsible disclosure Collier is

1193
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:13,420
absolutely nobody should have cusps I

1194
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:15,789
would anybody occurs for responsible

1195
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:17,079
disclosure should there be a compliant

1196
00:47:15,789 --> 00:47:18,970
base for organization should be an

1197
00:47:17,079 --> 00:47:21,660
compliant with a Naga a responsible

1198
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:24,279
disclosure platform something like that

1199
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:26,589
that is about the transparency piece

1200
00:47:24,280 --> 00:47:28,270
right so there are two angles of

1201
00:47:26,589 --> 00:47:30,578
transparency one is certain things that

1202
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:32,859
you anyway need to be disclosing and be

1203
00:47:30,579 --> 00:47:35,109
transparent about your use of data

1204
00:47:32,859 --> 00:47:37,359
etcetera and if there has been a breach

1205
00:47:35,109 --> 00:47:40,270
again there is a responsibility to

1206
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:42,848
disclose it so and then immediately you

1207
00:47:40,270 --> 00:47:44,740
have to also take steps to mitigate and

1208
00:47:42,849 --> 00:47:45,339
also disclose what are the steps you

1209
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:47,649
have taken

1210
00:47:45,339 --> 00:47:49,509
how are you ensuring that something like

1211
00:47:47,650 --> 00:47:51,039
that does not happen again so all of

1212
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:53,650
that is part of your transparency

1213
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:56,440
requirements what is more important in

1214
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:58,240
terms of getting breached by a black hat

1215
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:01,180
hacker encountering an organization on a

1216
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:03,640
ransom prospective or a sustainable the

1217
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:05,259
white hat security researcher who's you

1218
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,910
already know the answer to that one

1219
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:08,770
you're asking the question for the

1220
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:13,990
obvious answer what do you think is

1221
00:48:08,770 --> 00:48:16,299
worse or better depends where you live

1222
00:48:13,990 --> 00:48:18,788
for the first right so look here's the

1223
00:48:16,299 --> 00:48:21,369
deal I think the bottom line is if you

1224
00:48:18,789 --> 00:48:22,930
are attacking an organization that does

1225
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:24,599
have responsible disclosure policy or

1226
00:48:22,930 --> 00:48:28,180
does the bug bounty for a very specific

1227
00:48:24,599 --> 00:48:29,770
cordoned off domain go for it if you're

1228
00:48:28,180 --> 00:48:32,500
a black hat hacker then you know still

1229
00:48:29,770 --> 00:48:34,270
that like none of that matters to you at

1230
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:36,540
all you're gonna do what you're gonna do

1231
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:39,509
I think the responsibility of the CEO

1232
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:41,310
to prepare for every eventualities and

1233
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:43,590
to do appropriate threat modeling and

1234
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:46,620
understand when that looks like has an

1235
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:48,450
impact but just one sudden one thing

1236
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:51,200
like I don't want to say so many things

1237
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:53,609
on that because it'll or in a different

1238
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:55,470
tangent all together so so let me tell

1239
00:48:53,610 --> 00:48:59,700
you one thing like the corner these days

1240
00:48:55,470 --> 00:49:01,500
of individual hackers today there are

1241
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:03,359
companies respectable complaints they

1242
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:06,540
are aggregating the hackers and selling

1243
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:07,890
that services about goaty services also

1244
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:10,620
subscribe to that kind of a bug bounty

1245
00:49:07,890 --> 00:49:12,390
services and then get our thing assessed

1246
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:14,670
by security researchers which we have

1247
00:49:12,390 --> 00:49:16,770
been doing also presented and so but

1248
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:18,210
it's individual is coming it's dangerous

1249
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:19,740
for both that individual and for all

1250
00:49:18,210 --> 00:49:21,150
souls actually it's worse than that it's

1251
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,930
organized crime now which is also

1252
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:23,790
getting into it

1253
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:25,350
come on Joyce kept talking about her

1254
00:49:23,790 --> 00:49:27,720
motivation organized crime is now

1255
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:28,980
getting so last 30 seconds if I

1256

[Music]

1260
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:59,009
some day how many 12 years as far to be

1261
00:49:56,610 --> 00:50:01,800
a seesaw CPU if I call after you're

1262
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:07,680
confused question should they about

1263
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:09,270
yourself a black background okay

1264
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,339
let me use it everybody talk about the

1265
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:14,210
background so what I should should you

1266
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:14,210
be a CPA or Cecil

1267
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:23,400
if I want to hire you I want to pull all

1268
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:25,860
components okay can I can I give you an

1269
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:29,040
honest answer to that see gone are the

1270
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:31,440
days where the sea so you had sea sores

1271
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,910
and with you respect could come from any

1272
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,130
background and it still happens in

1273
00:50:32,910 --> 00:50:38,009
companies seesaws a highly technical job

1274
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:41,190
you better know your nuts and bolts so

1275
00:50:38,010 --> 00:50:44,210
you need to have and my background right

1276
00:50:41,190 --> 00:50:47,340
I've come up the nuts and bolts me right

1277
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:49,320
so you need to be technical as simple as

1278
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:51,060
that and you need to grow your knowledge

1279
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:53,970
because this is a very fast changing

1280
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:56,279
fast moving environment at the age of 40

1281
00:50:53,970 --> 00:50:57,720
45 50 50 nobody is expecting you to sit

1282
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:00,270
down and do this but you need here

1283
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:04,169
update they are okay I agree with that

1284
00:51:00,270 --> 00:51:07,200
but the point is you need to but you

1285
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:10,230
need to know the nuts and bolts so

1286
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:12,240
technical along the way you need to pick

1287
00:51:10,230 --> 00:51:15,360
up other skills and it is not just

1288
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:17,729
compliance its man management it is you

1289
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:20,220
know it is administration it is

1290
00:51:17,730 --> 00:51:23,580
compliance its regulation be legal

1291
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:25,410
perhaps how's the nomination oh sorry

1292
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:27,810
imagination is a big part of this so

00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:30,029
imagination creativity and it like meta

1294
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:31,470

I doing here income tax department data

1312
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:59,790
I want to understand who's the CC so or

1313
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:01,920
the DPO or the CRO with such kind of

1314
00:52:59,790 --> 00:53:04,680
data also when I'm hearing about

1315
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:06,390
reputational risk who takes the

1316
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:08,009
reputational risk when it comes to the

1317
00:53:06,390 --> 00:53:12,240
government when it comes to government

1318
00:53:08,010 --> 00:53:14,880
data that is going to be losing has been

1319
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:17,399
no statutory requirement which is why

1320
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,680
people have been appointing DPOs many

1321
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:22,079
companies did not have a formality to

1322
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:24,500
your structure it was it has mostly been

1323
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:26,730
part of you know information security a

1324
00:53:24,500 --> 00:53:29,190
couple of companies like Infosys

1325
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:31,650
have a very huge privacy organization

1326
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:34,890
and they have a mix of technical and

1327
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:36,420
legal team that does that I don't know

1328
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:38,970
if the government departments are having

1329
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:41,010
a separate DPO it will be there you know

1330
00:53:38,970 --> 00:53:43,578
whoever is the CEO of that organization

1331
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:47,280
who's responsible for all of this and

1332
00:53:43,579 --> 00:53:49,140
reputation risk is not going to impact

1333
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,089
them technically like people will make

1334
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:52,529
noise people will scream complain but do

1335
00:53:51,089 --> 00:53:55,470
you item Utley will have to comply if

1336
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:57,690
you have to complain right so that is a

1337
00:53:55,470 --> 00:54:00,808
different story as against the corporate

1338
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:03,599
take you know compliance or you know

1339
00:54:00,809 --> 00:54:06,329
reputation requirement because we have a

1340
00:54:03,599 --> 00:54:07,950
Supreme Court judgement on the other but

1341
00:54:06,329 --> 00:54:09,660
you still have other going to be linked

1342
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:11,970
to your pan and that's a very funny

1343
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:14,640
thing is that if you try to fill a form

1344
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:16,410
on the income tax website if I just put

1345
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:20,730
the pan I get all the details of the

1346
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:23,279
person including his other number so let

1347
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:25,349
me let me just start and see we are not

1348
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:27,780
here I don't think anybody here is

1349
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:30,240
competent enough to really give any

1350
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:31,210
comment that who is the CEO on who is

1351
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,939
the

1352
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:35,470
with the named person who is supposed to

1353
00:54:33,940 --> 00:54:37,420
take care of this I don't think we can

1354
00:54:35,470 --> 00:54:39,640
there is a seesaw another by the way so

1355
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:41,650
that could be a seesaw or about the

1356
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:43,900
repetition what you told reputation of

1357
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:45,670
simple income tax or repetition of the

1358
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:49,540
country is lies with the Parliament of

1359
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:51,849
the country okay so with that that means

1360
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:53,200
you have a ceasing times over 30 seconds

1361
00:54:51,849 --> 00:54:54,970
one each of two all and then I'll

1362
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:58,839
summarize your last views on this

1363
00:54:54,970 --> 00:55:02,160
subject CPU or C so future do what you

1364
00:54:58,839 --> 00:55:04,808
want your will go out do what you want

1365
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:06,430
pursue your passion I mean you want to

1366
00:55:04,809 --> 00:55:08,619
become a beach bum do it but do it with

1367
00:55:06,430 --> 00:55:11,049
passion I mean and don't chase success

1368
00:55:08,619 --> 00:55:13,420
success will chase you but if you if you

1369
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:15,640
aspire to be a seesaw then you know

1370
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:19,599
understand the skills required and do a

1371
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:21,730
damn good job of it that's it yes I just

1372
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:24,069
actually wanted to share very briefly

1373
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:24,700
the story of how my organization work

1374
00:55:24,069 --> 00:55:26,490
around this

1375
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:28,990
we had an information security

1376
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:31,720
organization and they were also handling

1377
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:33,939
privacy and then when gdpr happened you

1378
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:35,230
know we had to comply and we looked at a

1379
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:37,990
lot of things so you know I mentioned

1380
00:55:35,230 --> 00:55:39,790
before I had to upskill and me and the

1381
00:55:37,990 --> 00:55:41,529
seaso together went for training

1382
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:43,480
we both are you know now served over

1383
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:45,849
accidentally or by offices now we had to

1384
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:47,740
write all right so my becoming the DPO

1385
00:55:45,849 --> 00:55:52,900
finally was because we realized that the

1386
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:55,419
seaso can't do it so part of my role its

1387
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:58,299
I have a much larger role otherwise but

1388
00:55:55,420 --> 00:55:59,380
the point I was saying is that we work

1389
00:55:58,299 --> 00:56:02,799
together very much

1390
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:04,630
we both are you know fipc she and me and

1391
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:08,290
we keep working together so if you want

1392
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:10,750
to be as you move up it's very important

1393
00:56:08,290 --> 00:56:12,819
to be able to take a you know 360-degree

1394
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:14,619
picture view of everything and be able

1395
00:56:12,819 --> 00:56:16,869
to step back and not get you know

1396
00:56:14,619 --> 00:56:18,730
personally influenced and bias so body

1397
00:56:16,869 --> 00:56:20,890
of knowledge is always something that's

1398
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:23,829
going to help you it's important to keep

1399
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:26,618
learning studying and you know absorb

1400
00:56:23,829 --> 00:56:28,059
all of that and then take a very

1401
00:56:26,619 --> 00:56:30,640
calculated decision which is in the

1402
00:56:28,059 --> 00:56:32,619
interest of the company and the data

1403
00:56:30,640 --> 00:56:34,629
subjects as you're working you know so

1404
00:56:32,619 --> 00:56:36,940
that is what is important and it's not

1405
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:38,490
about one being more powerful than the

1406
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:40,330
other it's about who does a good job

1407
00:56:38,490 --> 00:56:44,689
[Music]

1408
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:50,870
live well laugh often and encrypt

1409
00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:54,710
everything so my one word is perpetually

1410
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:56,779
be in school so upskilling and cross

1411
00:56:54,710 --> 00:56:58,880
killing is necessary for a seesaw to

1412
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:01,940
even sustain a JC shoe forget about

1413
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:04,910
becoming a cpu or a CRO so technical

1414
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:06,530
skill is very important but over concern

1415
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:08,839
technical technical skill will not lead

1416
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:10,340
to anything it will only remain you to

1417
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:12,020
become a continued become messy so

1418
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:13,580
you'll never grow so you have to really

1419
00:57:12,020 --> 00:57:18,620
upscale and cross skill in various other

1420
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:20,480
domains yeah a mess for the last yeah so

1421
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:22,640
I certainly agree with what everybody

1422
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,320
said that but one thing everybody's

1423
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,190
saying I want to be a seesaw on a bser

1424
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:28,340
are you see

1425
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:29,630
CP oh whatever you got to remember soon

1426
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:31,580
as you get that see in front of your

1427
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:35,030
name you don't get to do much of the fun

1428
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:35,480
stuff anymore so be careful what you

1429
00:57:35,030 --> 00:57:36,980
wish for

1430
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:40,580
I can see who you are doing with that

1431
00:57:36,980 --> 00:57:41,660
right yeah okay so create discussion

1432
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:45,759
I'll just summarize on the lighter

1433
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:48,589
moment which I have captured live well

1434
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:52,010
live well laugh often encrypt everything

1435
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:54,260
else I am an accidental BPO and gdpr

1436
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:56,540
happen young was synonymous with

1437
00:57:54,260 --> 00:57:58,670
technology and I became a see so

1438
00:57:56,540 --> 00:58:01,850
accidentally though third days when

1439
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:04,730
Titans was not all Titans first time

1440
00:58:01,850 --> 00:58:06,799
hurt the seesaw in 2003 conflict of

1441
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:12,110
interest is a myth look for synergy

1442
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:14,240
still got he says that study get

1443
00:58:12,110 --> 00:58:17,750
knowledge Laxmi PCIe is what you

1444
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:19,939
mentioned so wealth will follow you true

1445
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:22,190
for the time for the data subjects again

1446
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:23,750
what you mentioned hoops I tripped and I

1447
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:25,970
was he so I said you're not done that

1448
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:30,050
way does not have to be a conflict of

1449
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:31,819
interest GDP our work is depressing and

1450
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:33,800
so it's compliance and compliance is not

1451
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:37,790
part of our seasonal job and the gotcha

1452
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:40,610
did not agree with that do you think a

1453
00:58:37,790 --> 00:58:41,750
data sort of a respective progress and

1454
00:58:40,610 --> 00:58:45,170
it shows its mind

1455
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:46,520
so whose job is it anyway missing the

1456
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:49,250
boots for the trees you could be

1457
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:52,610
compliant but not secure as what Manish

1458
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:53,120
mentioned user device data but

1459
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:55,160
ultimately

1460
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:57,620
protect the forms reputation we

1461
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:59,390
mentioned that don't drop the ball

1462
00:58:57,620 --> 00:59:03,200
Cecil role has become more and more

1463
00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:04,850
popular you mentioned the triangle

1464
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,140
between transparency privacy and

1465
00:59:04,850 --> 00:59:08,509
security and the three overlapping

1466
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:11,330
functions rights of data subjects

1467
00:59:08,510 --> 00:59:14,000
company could do well its security does

1468
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:16,130
not have to always roll of a seesaw you

1469
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:18,620
all seesaw is awesome you mentioned see

1470
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:22,030
so I like seesaw courier is so over I

1471
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:25,029
