1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:11,290
thank you some seven years ago in the

2
00:00:08,138 --> 00:00:14,169
winter of 2012 I got a phone call from

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:17,230
this guy with a strong Indian accent who

4
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:19,930
introduced himself as Clinton and Glinda

5
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:22,060
said it he had seen in my IP address was

6
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:25,660
infected with a virus something like

7
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:31,140
that and it sounds really scary okay

8
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:33,910
thank you okay I'll start again so some

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:37,149
seven years ago in the winter of 2012 I

10
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:39,428
got a phone call from this guy called

11
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:41,999
who introduced himself as Clinton and he

12
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:45,159
spoke with us from Indian accents and

13
00:00:41,999 --> 00:00:47,499
Clinton my IP address was having a virus

14
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:49,929
or something like that and it's really

15
00:00:47,499 --> 00:00:52,539
scary and he told me to run some

16
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:54,460
commands on Windows and that opened the

17
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:56,920
Event Viewer and I got this view and a

18
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:59,949
lot of errors and yeah that did sound

19
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:01,089
scary and it did sound like he knew what

20
00:00:59,949 --> 00:01:02,349
he was talking about yeah now what

21
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:05,260
Clinton didn't know is that I was

22
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,790
working in IT security and I I knew

23
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:08,920
actually was talking nonsense and that

24
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,240
these errors in the Event Viewer are

25
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,759
really scary

26
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,439
now the Clinton also didn't know is that

27
00:01:12,759 --> 00:01:17,710
actually I've been looking into this

28
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:19,630
kind of scams for some time because

29
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:23,350
living in England at a time and they

30
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:25,539
were quite quite prevalence and I'd

31
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:28,298
actually be able to give a talk about it

32
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:29,860
the next month so while Clinton was

33
00:01:28,299 --> 00:01:31,680
doing his thing I was into taking

34
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:35,409
screenshots and Clinton was essentially

35
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:38,579
doing my presentation for me so what he

36
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:40,899
did was you know he set up he made me

37
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:43,419
open up a remote desktop software

38
00:01:40,899 --> 00:01:46,869
activity could connect to my my PC we

39
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:49,149
just course virtual machine he ran some

40
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:52,299
scare where to like that kinda lots of

41
00:01:49,149 --> 00:01:55,030
errors my my PC lots of unprotected

42
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:58,119
things and that he he quote-unquote

43
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:59,679
convinced me to pay and he convinced me

44
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:05,289
to pay eighty nine pounds which is about

45
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:06,939
eight thousand rupees and for some

46
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:09,100
reason I tricked him into believing it I

47
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:11,379
paid I use a random credit card number

48
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,090
that kind of passed his check so I could

49
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:15,799
even see what happened after that he ran

50
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:19,640
some cheap free tools like this

51
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:25,040
fragmentation and free McAfee tool for

52
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:27,799
supposed to be 89 pounds so hello

53
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:32,000
welcome to my talk my focus on the state

54
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,590
of mower the the talk is a global

55
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,200
pockets about the state of mower around

56
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,910
the world and and what's happening but

57
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:40,100
I'm using a few examples that are

58
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:44,120
somehow related to India or in

59
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:46,220
subcontinent I'm not qualified to to

60
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:49,610
talk about more specifically targeting

61
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:52,340
India but there is a lot more where that

62
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:54,500
that's somehow relevant to India or

63
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,420
examples that are relevant to India and

64
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,480
so that explains the second part of my

65
00:02:56,420 --> 00:03:02,500
talk and speaking of the Indian

66
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:05,840
subcontinent this is where the first

67
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:08,210
ms-dos computer virus was written by

68
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,220
these two gentlemen from neighboring

69
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:15,800
country called Pakistan they wrote it in

70
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,840
1986 and on the 25th anniversary Mikko

71
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:21,260
HIPAA and from f-secure he went to visit

72
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,420
them and there's a very nice video of

73
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,940
his visit to this to these guys but the

74
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,200
first virus is called brain and if you

75
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,000
never watched it and you would want to

76
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,920
know a little bit of history like like

77
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:36,770
Adam deceptiveness talk you definitely

78
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:38,980
go and watch this video service me I'm

79
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:42,170
my thing

80
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:44,209
whenever I'm sitting in a conference

81
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:45,799
listening to talks I always impressed by

82
00:03:44,209 --> 00:03:48,140
how clever everyone is and I think I'm

83
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:52,190
not because why everyone so clever I'm

84
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:54,440
not so I think we should face this

85
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:56,510
impostor syndrome head-on so there's all

86
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:59,090
sorts of things that I I think I can't

87
00:03:56,510 --> 00:04:00,019
do and I just want to make two things

88
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,550
clear though and I think that's

89
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:04,040
important they said I'm not to refer to

90
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:06,820
engineer this is not my own research I'm

91
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,780
using research work done by others

92
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:11,870
people have spoken to people that have

93
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:16,459
published things and I'll credits all

94
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:19,190
the slides where elephants and also not

95
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:20,870
someone who defends more she's more in

96
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,400
the real world in that I don't work at a

97
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:26,450
company defending them against smaller

98
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,870
attacks and I'm I'm Dutch I have a Dutch

99
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:29,280
passport I work for

100
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,680
I represent the UK company Air Farce

101
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:37,130
peloton and actually live in Greece at

102
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:39,870
the moment so I'm I'm European basically

103
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:43,130
so this first the first example I always

104
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:45,479
started with these foam supports camps

105
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,590
they're not really malware but I think I

106
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:49,409
stole some lessons we can learn from

107
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:51,448
them and one of the tops of generating

108
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:52,800
is effective because I said okay this

109
00:04:51,449 --> 00:04:55,110
was known since this thing about even

110
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,690
fewer and it was nonsense but at the

111
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,979
same time if you're if you don't know

112
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:01,080
very much about the Buddhist it sounded

113
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:02,940
quite credible and ok the language he

114
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,159
was using was a bit silly about IP

115
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,780
addresses ending viruses but in general

116
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,720
you know people are aware there's a big

117
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:12,869
mower problem I can see what people fall

118
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,850
for that and that's also this scam

119
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:17,100
worked for economic reasons because I

120
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:20,250
looked into that and how did the people

121
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,949
calling me they make a few thousand

122
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:26,010
dollars a year maximum so it's not a

123
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:27,930
very profitable scam and it only works

124
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:30,419
because of an economic imbalance between

125
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,340
India and and the West two countries

126
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:35,400
they were targeting so these things we

127
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:38,400
shouldn't ignore I mean the imbalance is

128
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,500
unfair but it is there and that's why it

129
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:43,888
makes economic sense for to make people

130
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,570
from India call

131
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:52,550
call people in England and other

132
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:54,960
countries so another example this is a

133
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:56,190
pie chart from as particular campaign

134
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,620
from necklace and I do if you can read

135
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,539
it but the green bit is a it's the

136
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:03,870
number of email sent from India which is

137
00:06:00,539 --> 00:06:05,580
a little more than a quarter of of

138
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:07,740
emails from a particular spam campaign

139
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:11,039
from a few years ago or sent from India

140
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:13,710
now it's not surprising that India ends

141
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,900
up high in any botnets pie chart like

142
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:17,820
this because India is the second largest

143
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,789
country on Earth it also has the second

144
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,260
largest in the population and unlike

145
00:06:20,789 --> 00:06:23,669
China which is the number one it doesn't

146
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:26,610
have a big firewall around the country

147
00:06:23,669 --> 00:06:27,539
so you expect India to end up high but

148
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:29,970
if you look at the other countries that

149
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:33,000
are there you see Vietnam Mexico Iran

150
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:35,610
Pakistan Indonesia but you don't see the

151
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,140
u.s. which is the third largest internet

152
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:40,590
country you don't see other very lucky

153
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:45,440
in that countries like Germany the UK

154
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:47,789
France and there's a reason for that

155
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,460
Mako's is a botnet that is has been

156
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:51,780
active since about 2012 and it's still

157
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,270
active there was a someone wrote a

158
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:56,369
research post about it yesterday it has

159
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:59,640
not actively spread for seven for

160
00:06:56,370 --> 00:07:02,220
several years so four or five years now

161
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:04,260
try to imagine what this means I mean

162
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,000
look we're all IT professionals we

163
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:10,320
probably have bought a new computer in

164
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,880
the last few years this meant buying a

165
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,290
new computer means that you get rid of

166
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,530
or you could rid of any more infection

167
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:17,940
but if you if your PC is in fact it with

168
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:20,729
macros that means you've been using it

169
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:23,490
for many years it probably runs Windows

170
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:24,960
XP it might run an unlicensed version of

171
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,600
Windows XP it probably doesn't run any

172
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:38,760
security software

173
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:41,430
so yeah the necklace is yet and

174
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,500
negatives in fact has infected all the

175
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:46,830
devices and and it's not representative

176
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,150
for the kind of advance more that the

177
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,099
target is Windows 10 or something like

178
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:51,840
that

179
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:54,930
here's an example of all the spam that I

180
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:57,650
caught at Makris and when I looked at

181
00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:02,640
this in our little lab I saw about

182
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:05,039
35,000 emails in our lap of this time

183
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,510
combined and that's a fairly large

184
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,100
number that means that millions and

185
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:11,219
millions of emails of this kind have

186
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:19,290
been sent it's it's a pump-and-dump scan

187
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:21,540
so obscure cryptocurrency a dump botnet

188
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:23,430
it's a botnet where were size matters it

189
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:26,000
has a lot of infections and yet they're

190
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:28,800
mostly in comfort like India and Vietnam

191
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,690
but it's huge I don't know how big it is

192
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,130
at the moment but I think it was at some

193
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:35,700
board it's had more than a million

194
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:37,799
infections and these are very things

195
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:40,560
like spamming like sending leaders

196
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:42,750
effects like mining cryptocurrencies

197
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:46,229
like using it for a proxy Network these

198
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:48,270
are for for things that were size

199
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:50,100
matters you know this is the kind of Bob

200
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:52,520
metal things things that only make sense

201
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,390
if you have a botnet of a good size

202
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,920
interestingly did this

203
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:59,189
article that was posted yesterday about

204
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,800
micro spies CenturyLink mentions these

205
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,510
four things as things that necklace is

206
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,160
actively doing at the moment or has

207
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:08,130
capable of doing it has modules for

208
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:10,410
these things so yeah these are four

209
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:16,590
things that that that large dump about

210
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:18,719
nerds but even the nekaris which is you

211
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,280
know it's a botnet mostly old infections

212
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,650
you can imagine like a very small

213
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:25,500
company that hasn't had the money to buy

214
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:28,170
a new PC for about a decade still being

215
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,150
infected with nekaris II the people

216
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,319
behind nekaris and there's some reason

217
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:32,670
to believe they're Russian and there's

218
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,850
some reason to believe that not the

219
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:36,930
people who recently wrote the who were

220
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:40,260
originally behind it

221
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:45,000
so the people behind makers realize that

222
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:46,500
some of the infections they have they

223
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,240
might might actually be a bit more

224
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:53,190
valuable they may have infections that

225
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:56,360
on machines that do francette are

226
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:58,470
involved in financial transactions so

227
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:59,480
last year Trend Micro or the blogpost

228
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:02,490
about

229
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,670
nekaris operators pushing a rack like a

230
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:08,460
remote access tool to certain machines

231
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:12,000
on it's almost bought mats that's a

232
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:13,950
certain criteria such as the nephew

233
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,200
named the meth user included earth-like

234
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:21,750
Bank so what lessons learned dumb

235
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,230
botnets like nekaris like many of the

236
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:27,150
IOT botnets like with Mirai they focus

237
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:28,770
on quantity rather than rather than

238
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:31,590
quality this is sorry I should have

239
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:33,120
fixed that size matters too damn sighs

240
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:37,020
more than done quality matters to them

241
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,420
and in typical infections are yeah Kula

242
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,520
secure devices in that this case it's

243
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:44,520
old and often unlicensed Windows

244
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,980
versions in in other places is IOT

245
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:49,710
devices which is probably the most

246
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:51,600
low-hanging fruit at the moment but even

247
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,060
dumb botnets as we saw have and smart

248
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,440
parts

249
00:10:53,060 --> 00:11:00,800
so let's look at another piece of

250
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,750
malware but emote that this is from the

251
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,400
Hindu business line which is a Indian

252
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:08,720
news business website and they quoted

253
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:12,199
Sanjay Cathcart enough Sanjay is here

254
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:13,580
he runs quick he liver India a great guy

255
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:17,960
and a nice

256
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:19,280
it's a antivirus company and he said you

257
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,470
know they detected five how to spam

258
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:24,410
emails every day carrying throne is like

259
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:26,570
knickers and Android versus one and a

260
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:29,510
half lakh which is if you're not from

261
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:31,160
India you can do a dramatic very quick

262
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:33,590
it's one of the fifty thousands which

263
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,339
basically means five thousand times 30

264
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:39,800
days in a month so it's the same number

265
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:42,110
now remember that I saw a single nekross

266
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:45,380
campaign sending thirty five thousand

267
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:49,010
emails just to me is to my little lab so

268
00:11:45,380 --> 00:11:51,890
imagine the difference in or look at the

269
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:53,450
difference in scale between necros and

270
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:57,699
100 email that in the other email that

271
00:11:53,450 --> 00:12:00,620
is much smaller in scale but much larger

272
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:03,440
but is more effective for various

273
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,270
reasons so let's look at history of

274
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,780
Imhotep it was first discovered and

275
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:12,470
probably written in 2014 as a banking

276
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:14,089
Trojan you know it's obvious why more

277
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:16,480
we're targeting online bank transactions

278
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:20,950
make sense you can ensue money you can

279
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:23,900
send for transfer to different accounts

280
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:26,300
evolved teams if it has changed I think

281
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:29,900
from from 2017 to a mall where

282
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:31,339
downloader this is you probably can't

283
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:35,270
read that and that's right

284
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:38,240
this is from a blocks from Cryptologic

285
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:40,430
who explained how in a particular case

286
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:44,600
and they saw necker's download another

287
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:46,760
more cool trick both which is probably

288
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:49,310
almost on par with networks where that

289
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,240
when it comes to advanced and trick but

290
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,900
then download it

291
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:57,020
ryuko which is some advanced ransomware

292
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:59,360
which is used in targeted attacks and

293
00:12:57,020 --> 00:13:01,579
this this blog post was about the case

294
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,170
against some us printing presses which

295
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:05,780
meant that some US newspapers like the

296
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:06,769
LA Times couldn't be published for a few

297
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:08,480
days

298
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:10,309
or at least one day because of this this

299
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,889
runs Burdick they started with a simple

300
00:13:10,309 --> 00:13:17,238
ordinary malware downloader code nekaris

301
00:13:14,889 --> 00:13:19,610
and if you've never seen nekaris this is

302
00:13:17,239 --> 00:13:23,569
an example of a of a spam email the

303
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:26,119
tentmakers and I've removed the email

304
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:29,449
addresses but it looks credible you know

305
00:13:26,119 --> 00:13:34,100
it's not this this over the top pump and

306
00:13:29,449 --> 00:13:38,660
dump scam me more but that's the nekros

307
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:40,069
and it's it's a simple we all get these

308
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:41,420
kind of emails every day with the fax

309
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:43,790
ones and public without the tax

310
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:45,079
medicines with links and under the hood

311
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:48,199
there are also lots of ways in which

312
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:50,660
even that is quite quite clever and and

313
00:13:48,199 --> 00:13:53,779
typically what for email that and for

314
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:55,850
many other modern more families what you

315
00:13:53,779 --> 00:13:57,410
need to do is you get a word document

316
00:13:55,850 --> 00:14:00,649
either in a link or in the taxi media

317
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:01,969
open it you've been told in one way or

318
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:03,279
another that you need to enable macros

319
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:05,749
for something that happens for the

320
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:07,160
encryption to be decoded offer it will

321
00:14:05,749 --> 00:14:11,899
be made compatible with your current

322
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:13,639
version of word a little bit history for

323
00:14:11,899 --> 00:14:15,319
those who don't remember or for those

324
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:19,790
who don't know

325
00:14:15,319 --> 00:14:21,529
in the 1990s Microsoft Office had

326
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:23,719
enabled macros which is a way to run

327
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:26,209
code inside office documents and I was

328
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:28,639
running by default so surprise surprise

329
00:14:26,209 --> 00:14:32,569
there were a lot of macro worms and

330
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:34,069
viruses things like I think Melissa and

331
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:35,269
it basically work like that yeah you

332
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:37,490
have an email with it you open the

333
00:14:35,269 --> 00:14:41,420
attachment the attachment run macros we

334
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:44,089
Bailey use your email address to expect

335
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:47,899
the the thing further so you got a warm

336
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:50,329
this was before the cybercrime era so

337
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:52,610
there wasn't really like a financial

338
00:14:50,329 --> 00:14:55,399
components often there but it still it

339
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:58,610
did serious damage so Microsoft wisely

340
00:14:55,399 --> 00:15:01,249
decided in the early 2000s to disable

341
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:04,339
execution of macros by default and that

342
00:15:01,249 --> 00:15:05,720
really stopped this issue and then some

343
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:07,160
five years ago I think it started in

344
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,709
2014 2013

345
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,689
poor all's design more authors were

346
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:14,018
wondering what if we just asked people

347
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:16,579
to enable macros good at work and

348
00:15:14,019 --> 00:15:18,769
surprise surprise it works and it worked

349
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:20,420
that still works is used in emote at as

350
00:15:18,769 --> 00:15:24,579
well as in money

351
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:27,769
even more targets at once more campaigns

352
00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:31,010
so lessons learned from image that's

353
00:15:27,769 --> 00:15:32,709
download is are imported I'll say a bit

354
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:34,700
more about it in the next example

355
00:15:32,709 --> 00:15:36,469
mass-market more aware because a motet

356
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:40,100
is not they're not targeted attacks

357
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:41,899
emote that is sent to generally smaller

358
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,300
groups of people make trying to avoid

359
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:46,220
things like spam craps on honey pots but

360
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,839
other than that there's no they're not

361
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:50,930
targeting specific people it's still

362
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,730
mass markets but it's prioritizing and I

363
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:54,109
made another mistake and I always mess

364
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:56,810
up these words when I write them down a

365
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:58,779
prioritizes quality of a quality not as

366
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:00,800
I wrote it here apologize

367
00:15:58,779 --> 00:16:03,050
so it's engineering we seen it before

368
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,540
that works and and when I say social

369
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:07,430
engineering works I don't mean to blame

370
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,980
the user I think it works because the

371
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:12,829
user does something that makes total

372
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:14,269
sense you think why the sum would

373
00:16:12,829 --> 00:16:16,339
someone enabled macros now I don't know

374
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:18,800
if you ever downloaded PDF of the

375
00:16:16,339 --> 00:16:21,529
internet and open it an acrobat reader

376
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:25,339
and then try to print it you need to

377
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:27,620
enable some kind of thing Acrobat or

378
00:16:25,339 --> 00:16:29,779
Adobe Reader tells you to to do

379
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:31,550
something which looks very similar to an

380
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:33,579
egg with macros the thing is in this

381
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:37,310
case it's fine it's a security measure

382
00:16:33,579 --> 00:16:39,859
but in in the case of word macros it

383
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:42,170
isn't fine

384
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,540
and finally and that's what we're

385
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:45,920
talking about in in my next example

386
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:48,560
techniques that imitate uses are barely

387
00:16:45,920 --> 00:17:01,160
distinguishable from those used by apt

388
00:16:48,560 --> 00:17:04,549
groups so um it's an example from a

389
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:08,240
report by symmetry ax from pick 2 or 3

390
00:17:04,549 --> 00:17:11,599
years ago it's about four years ago

391
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:14,780
maybe I know it's it's about a more apt

392
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:18,230
group called patchwork and what symmetry

393
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:23,599
is my process in this quote and in the

394
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:27,199
report in general is that the the target

395
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:28,820
of this of the smaller group as well as

396
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,280
the time zone in which the developers

397
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:33,049
seem to operate basically suggests it's

398
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,220
India behind this now I should make two

399
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:36,929
things clear

400
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:39,059
firstly I'm not making a moral judgement

401
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:40,649
on the weather in the or any other

402
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:42,779
country because any other countries

403
00:17:40,649 --> 00:17:44,779
doing this most countries are engaged in

404
00:17:42,779 --> 00:17:47,399
this kind of thing should be writing

405
00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:48,960
espionage campaigns to be engaged in

406
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:51,959
espionage campaigns like like that's

407
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:55,110
work is an example and secondly I make

408
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:58,020
it clear in the ass as much a victim as

409
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:59,879
a perpetrator of these attacks and maybe

410
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:02,250
a third point because I've seen and this

411
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:06,809
probably not so surprising in this

412
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:09,120
audience but I've seen Americans haven't

413
00:18:06,809 --> 00:18:12,029
dismiss if we talk about oh yeah is apts

414
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,620
from from Iran North Korea China and

415
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:14,929
Russia and oh yes India and Pakistan

416
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:17,549
they're only attacking each other

417
00:18:14,929 --> 00:18:19,260
India and Pakistan and other countries

418
00:18:17,549 --> 00:18:24,299
in this region they're they're part of

419
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:26,490
the global scene so to say geopolitics

420
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:31,980
affects globally there's a good reason

421
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:34,289
to assume India's also spying on on

422
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:41,220
China on Saudi Arabia prob'ly on Western

423
00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:43,379
countries in the vice versa so apt it's

424
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,500
become kind of cool to say what an apt

425
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:49,679
attack out of us is very very advanced

426
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:51,299
so I'd like to use this definition ATR

427
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:54,450
persistent threats that are advanced

428
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:56,100
enough and even James Bond is just

429
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:58,590
trying if a doors actually blocked

430
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:02,178
before he does some fancy stuff to open

431
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:04,289
it so if these are advanced enough

432
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:06,120
persistent threats and persistent in the

433
00:19:04,289 --> 00:19:09,570
sense that they really mean target a

434
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:11,250
specific person a Pacific entity so

435
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:12,330
another report on packs work there's

436
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:17,399
been quite a but a lot written about

437
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:18,480
this it's this if you look at the

438
00:19:17,399 --> 00:19:20,489
document name it you can see the

439
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:24,539
probably targets China or something

440
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:27,419
ready to China the malicious RTF

441
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:33,390
documents exploits vulnerability codes

442
00:19:27,419 --> 00:19:35,870
CV 2017 eight five seven zero and drop

443
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:39,059
something called quasar rat now

444
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:41,489
velocities report was from the spring

445
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:42,330
referred to malware used in the spring

446
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:46,010
of 2018

447
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:47,340
it was exploiting a vulnerability faxed

448
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:49,379
in the

449
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:52,379
before you know if you just apply

450
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:55,350
Microsoft taxes every month as you

451
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:57,270
should you won't get you won't have a

452
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:58,530
problem with the small work group you

453
00:19:57,270 --> 00:20:01,530
know this is a nation-state actor

454
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:05,879
probably this is the people targets are

455
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:08,490
of geopolitical interest so yeah you

456
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:09,390
would expect them from Marva at this

457
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:10,320
point that they would just apply

458
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,120
practice all the time

459
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,820
but yeah it's more complicated than that

460
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,879
and this is quite a record was spreading

461
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:19,590
it's not some kind of advanced tool it's

462
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:25,770
it's an open source remote access tool

463
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:27,389
and you can find them on github this

464
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:29,700
came out early this weekend thought it

465
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:32,820
was nice to include there's another apt

466
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:35,100
group probably also Indian it's called

467
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,510
bitter this is from Palo Alto Networks

468
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:40,320
and one of the first ones to write about

469
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:42,600
this but have an update so between

470
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:46,320
November 2018 and January of this year

471
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:48,780
they were exploiting another

472
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:51,629
vulnerability in the equation editor CV

473
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:54,810
2017 some something which means it was

474
00:20:51,630 --> 00:21:00,440
faxed late in 2017 so these machines

475
00:20:54,810 --> 00:21:00,440
hadn't faxed office for more than a year

476
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:06,600
so let's look at emote adverse effects

477
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:09,740
work and you notice that what happens is

478
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:12,870
very similar there's an email is sent

479
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:15,030
then the sum over is downloaded such as

480
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:17,550
email death such is the first dialog

481
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:22,410
from from packs work and then there's a

482
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:25,050
final payload that that's the real

483
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:28,080
purpose of them our now that there's two

484
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:29,610
differences here Imhotep as I said it's

485
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,490
no Parker that's emote at first this

486
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:34,800
tragedy who would can infect and then it

487
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,630
decides depending on the auto target

488
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:40,290
what payload is interesting for them hey

489
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:44,550
there's a high-value target I might want

490
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:48,649
to use a financial trojan or espionage

491
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:51,720
tool or some high-value ransomware

492
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:53,220
whereas packs work and many ATT

493
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:56,520
campaigns like black box work

494
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:58,230
they first select the targets and then

495
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,850
the the final preload today they've

496
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:03,180
already have it ready

497
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:05,429
but apart from that apart from the

498
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,870
operational differences technically its

499
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:11,400
work more less the same and it's all

500
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:12,899
favorites around this is downloader now

501
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,330
I know many of you are into

502
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:17,310
vulnerability research and and the holy

503
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:19,530
grail of vulnerability research is

504
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:23,290
getting code execution on on a machine

505
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:24,500
on a connected coffee maker on whatever

506
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:26,610
[Music]

507
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,590
now this is not about vulnerabilities

508
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:30,689
but actually what a downloaded us a

509
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:32,100
mower download it gives you code

510
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:33,630
execution on the machine you could do

511
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,850
anything you want if you have this

512
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:42,240
that's the holy grail of malware this is

513
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:45,330
why downloads are so important and I

514
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,280
should say the final payload in it

515
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:49,139
doesn't always have to be like more in a

516
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,230
traditional sense so always a PE file

517
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:53,940
sometimes it's just some PowerShell code

518
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:58,560
that's run sometimes might even be like

519
00:22:53,940 --> 00:23:01,530
a reverse as is HDL that's open and I

520
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:04,139
find this from Jessica Payne works for

521
00:23:01,530 --> 00:23:07,020
Microsoft's very helpful tweets

522
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:09,750
basically if you're worried about apt

523
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:11,910
attacks make sure you can defend against

524
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:16,500
emo tests because that probably makes

525
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:18,870
you make you able to defend against IPD

526
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,760
attacks and the thing is you know we

527
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:22,500
think if you look at the mode that we

528
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,180
think out of course you can defend

529
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:27,450
against a mode that because it's you

530
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:29,670
know just don't don't click macros maybe

531
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:33,570
disable macros throughout your

532
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:36,480
enterprise emote that is email data

533
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:39,659
factions live in many large 4500

534
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,540
companies which means that malicious

535
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:46,980
authors have code execution within large

536
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:49,230
fortune 500 fortune 500 companies so

537
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:52,290
what have you learned about our

538
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:54,150
patchwork and naivety groups and they're

539
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:56,010
not that different from the more

540
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:58,620
advanced komoti more like emote that

541
00:23:56,010 --> 00:24:01,740
like straight quad

542
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:02,850
an exploit scalable humans like people

543
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,620
who can be tricked into explaining

544
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:07,320
macros and again not making a value

545
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:09,090
judgment here and bad systems like

546
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,639
people who haven't updated their word

547
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:13,169
for for about a year because in practice

548
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,530
you know I know we know it's important

549
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:16,830
but if

550
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:18,480
don't really know it's important updates

551
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:20,010
always stop by the time when you don't

552
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,200
want it and it is easy to destroy them

553
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:27,090
off and funny it's all about the

554
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:30,740
downloader so let's take another step

555
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:34,439
and look at some Pegasus Pegasus is

556
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:38,670
mobile more at a target of iOS and I

557
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:41,070
think also Android it's written it's

558
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:44,640
available commercially its swords to

559
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:46,710
government's and written by an Israeli

560
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:49,440
company called MSO group and if you

561
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:50,880
haven't haven't heard of another group I

562
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,740
would recommend that you do some

563
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:58,260
research because that's some quite

564
00:24:52,740 --> 00:25:00,950
intriguing stories one of the pegasus

565
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:04,560
groups one of the nation-state actors

566
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:06,180
most targeting countries in this region

567
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:09,030
such as India Pakistan and Bangladesh

568
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:12,500
and a few others I have no idea who this

569
00:25:09,030 --> 00:25:14,879
particular actor is but an Esso group

570
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:17,220
claims it only sells to nation-states

571
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:19,290
and he thinks you may think oh that

572
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:22,530
that's ok then you make sure that

573
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:26,389
there's no evil criminals using it one

574
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:30,000
person who was targeted by a by Pegasus

575
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:32,480
honest iPhone is a human rights lawyer

576
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:36,740
from the United Arab Emirates called

577
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:39,210
ahmed mansour he is currently in prison

578
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,980
for ten years for speaking out against

579
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:43,860
these governments and he's likely being

580
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:46,710
tortured and they spied on him through

581
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:50,429
his through through this malware almost

582
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:54,600
on his iPhone so they may say I say we

583
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:56,430
only sell to two governments but within

584
00:25:54,600 --> 00:26:01,679
that with that constraint they don't

585
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:03,720
seem to have many ethical concerns but

586
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,330
Pegasus is really advanced in this

587
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:09,060
attack this is back against Hamas or I

588
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:11,850
just mentioned three zero day

589
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:14,460
vulnerabilities and iOS were used to

590
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:17,340
change now I don't know if you follow

591
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:21,000
the security news a bit the prices of

592
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:25,139
exploits and zero definitely stay off to

593
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:27,030
make the news for iOS you can easily

594
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,950
sell your ex

595
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:33,080
for hundreds of thousands of dollars if

596
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:39,180
not more so this is really expensive

597
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:43,770
more so zero dates are used in some

598
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:45,270
target attacks however and then should

599
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:46,950
also say surveys are used probably a

600
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,780
little bit more than we realize because

601
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:53,220
a lot of these attacks never make the

602
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:55,500
news for various reasons however zero

603
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:57,950
days for most attackers are very bad

604
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,570
provides very bad return on investments

605
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:03,330
there they're very expensive as I just

606
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:05,340
saw you as it just mentions about

607
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:07,439
Pegasus you have to pay hundreds of

608
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:11,520
thousands of dollars to write an attack

609
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:13,140
and a zero day is burned as soon as as

610
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:15,780
soon as the attack is discovered because

611
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:20,580
the affected company that is so far

612
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:23,730
straight away whereas if you if you use

613
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:25,740
like a no export on an old version of

614
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:27,150
officers are still widely used that you

615
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,560
don't have this problem and the worst of

616
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:31,470
happen is that your target may back to

617
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:33,090
office but Microsoft cons that's obvious

618
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:37,230
for everyone because if they could they

619
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:39,510
would do that and defending against zero

620
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:41,490
days is also often poor return on

621
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:43,129
investment so my name 0 days are have

622
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:48,480
long been a bit of a height and

623
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:50,220
companies sell all sorts of software to

624
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,930
prevent you against it now I think

625
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:55,140
mitigating against these attacks is not

626
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:56,490
necessarily a bad idea but force missed

627
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:58,020
before for smaller companies and

628
00:27:56,490 --> 00:28:00,810
organizations that are not the specific

629
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:04,139
targets it may be wise to just accept

630
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:06,659
like okay we're small if someone is

631
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:08,340
willing to spend hundreds of thousands

632
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:10,530
of dollars to attack us maybe we can't

633
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:13,409
attack against us and it's the same if

634
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:16,620
you run a small business here in India

635
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:20,130
then yes you look you're you're safe you

636
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:22,020
you lock your doors but you're not gonna

637
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:24,270
spend any money protecting against

638
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:27,120
someone with three armed armored cars

639
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:29,490
outside your office you just assume that

640
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:32,030
that's a risky so unlikely and the cost

641
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:34,980
of defending against it are so high that

642
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:37,820
there's not worth it but there are cases

643
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:40,110
such as people like journalists

644
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:41,309
high-profile politicians people high in

645
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:45,918
business

646
00:28:41,309 --> 00:28:48,539
some civil liberty activists for whom

647
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,059
defending against zero days is something

648
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:53,279
that I need to do and probably less

649
00:28:51,059 --> 00:28:56,370
using technical measures than about

650
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:58,980
using certain operational measures like

651
00:28:56,370 --> 00:29:01,649
separation of devices using a very

652
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:06,600
primitive phone to contact your contacts

653
00:29:01,649 --> 00:29:08,189
etc at the final example I don't know

654
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:11,070
how much yeah I think it's reasonable to

655
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:12,899
read it's it's but something called

656
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:15,860
stall core where that's not one piece of

657
00:29:12,899 --> 00:29:20,189
malware that that's a mower family or

658
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:22,110
many pieces of related mower and this

659
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:27,090
neat article is from the economic times

660
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:28,740
Indian business site and it refers to a

661
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:31,918
talk given at this conference one year

662
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:34,649
ago by Eva galperin from the FF who I

663
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:40,350
believe is speaking not next door but in

664
00:29:34,649 --> 00:29:43,949
some room at this moment and stalker

665
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:47,370
where is commercially available spyware

666
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:51,630
saw two individuals and it's it's used

667
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:54,178
all right it's sold it's sometimes sold

668
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:55,409
but Eid that you can make to always make

669
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:57,769
sure where your children are or where

670
00:29:55,409 --> 00:30:00,990
your employees are but it's also used

671
00:29:57,769 --> 00:30:03,750
marketed to respire your partner on this

672
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:05,909
box if you suspect them from cheating

673
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:08,460
now there are all sorts of other cool

674
00:30:05,909 --> 00:30:10,760
things to say about people's expecting

675
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:14,909
their partners cheating and rather than

676
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:18,600
discussing this using spyware but this

677
00:30:14,909 --> 00:30:21,179
kind of stalker is used in many abusive

678
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:27,510
relationships with often very serious

679
00:30:21,179 --> 00:30:29,870
consequences including physical violence

680
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,870
and worse

681
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:35,700
and the thing about abusive

682
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:37,830
relationships is that they're abusive

683
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:40,020
that that's that's true but they're also

684
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:44,070
relationship these are people that are

685
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:45,900
still together for some reason or they

686
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:49,110
may have split up but they may still

687
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:51,600
share a house or may still have shared

688
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:54,540
control over children so they may often

689
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,429
be in the same place from purely

690
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:59,040
technical point of view how this malware

691
00:30:56,430 --> 00:31:01,080
works is that the the attacker has

692
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:03,000
physical access to the victims phone

693
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:06,990
some of them desktop but usually phone

694
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:10,370
and can install the mower and if you

695
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:14,460
have physical access to a device well

696
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:15,989
all bets are off at the same time that's

697
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,460
not something that we tend to think

698
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:19,890
about we don't threat mobile for that we

699
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:24,240
don't threat model for an attack where

700
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:25,950
the the mower author sometimes hits on

701
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,840
the on the victims of the targets chair

702
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:30,570
and then has the same access on that

703
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,340
computer on the phone so it is really

704
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:35,100
hard to defend against but I also think

705
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,659
that as a community we should consider

706
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:42,120
this threat seriously and try to find

707
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:43,500
ways to how we can fight this so I think

708
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,939
that this one important lesson here is

709
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:48,090
that just because something is outside a

710
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:49,950
standard model it doesn't mean it can't

711
00:31:48,090 --> 00:31:52,559
cause serious damage and I think the

712
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:54,809
damage caused by stalker where about

713
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:59,309
partners and abusive relationship who

714
00:31:54,809 --> 00:32:02,160
suddenly know often know where the other

715
00:31:59,309 --> 00:32:04,080
person is and use that to scare them hey

716
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:07,200
I know you were talking to your friend

717
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:12,059
yesterday the damage is probably more

718
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,830
severe than most ordinary mower so I've

719
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:16,710
used six examples now and I want to talk

720
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:19,500
a little bit about something else I want

721
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:22,020
to discuss how do I do this that that

722
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:23,990
that devices or that the combination of

723
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:27,030
the vines and the vines owner and get

724
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:28,080
infected with malware so introducing

725
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:29,850
something which are called amour

726
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:34,500
wearability chart and I'm making up that

727
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:37,350
word and to explain what I mean is that

728
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:40,050
sorry heesu device on this chart and

729
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:41,820
think of a device as the device in its

730
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:43,139
current state with the packages that are

731
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:45,240
or are not applied and also

732
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:48,150
the owner and the owner what what I do

733
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:49,920
encounter and I basically there are two

734
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:52,260
caps one that's a that's a vulnerability

735
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:55,920
gap in that the device is vulnerable

736
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:57,690
maybe known vulnerabilities may be easy

737
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,260
to find unknown ones may be hard to find

738
00:32:57,690 --> 00:33:05,030
unknown ones so there's a gap between

739
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:07,590
that can be exploited but that's also

740
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:11,430
what I call a social engineering gap and

741
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:13,500
that means how easy it is to install

742
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:15,900
malware assuming you can be tricked how

743
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:18,360
easy it is to actually install more so

744
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:19,710
I'll look at some examples and I'm that

745
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:21,659
makes it absolutely clear this is not

746
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:23,880
hard science I'm just trying to

747
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:25,920
illustrate it so we understand latest

748
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:29,400
version of Windows pretty secure

749
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:31,980
operating system it's very high up but

750
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:35,610
yeah it's not perfect every month

751
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:37,080
Microsoft security patches some of which

752
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:40,110
has already been exploited in the walls

753
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,939
others hadn't been that but are still

754
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:45,659
pretty serious and if you don't apply

755
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:47,550
them then it drops down in the chart but

756
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,990
also it is something it's a device in

757
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:50,460
which you can install software which

758
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:52,800
means you can install more work either

759
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:55,440
by being tricked in it or by being

760
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:57,240
tricked to enable a macro which then run

761
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,270
some code and this code can install more

762
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:04,230
I mean you can run code on a Windows

763
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:06,270
thing when it's 10 device now let's

764
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:07,650
place Linux there now I don't want to go

765
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:09,960
into discussion whether Linux is more

766
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:11,550
secure than Windows I think it really

767
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:16,168
depends but say an average Linux desktop

768
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:17,850
computer is let's let's assume it's more

769
00:34:16,168 --> 00:34:21,179
or less equally secure than Windows 10

770
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:22,679
and however on Linux

771
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:23,909
that's kind of the nice thing about it

772
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:26,580
you know I'm a Linux user I've been

773
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:28,620
Linux user for I think 17 years and

774
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:31,290
before it's some UNIX for a few years so

775
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:33,270
I love Linux I it's my operating system

776
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:35,690
of choice and I love it because you can

777
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:41,489
do so many things but at the same time

778
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:43,679
from a moral point of view that's that's

779
00:34:41,489 --> 00:34:47,908
bad I mean I think it would be pretty

780
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:50,460
disaster if everyone waits to - boom -

781
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:51,929
if everyone did the Windows 10 PC and

782
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:54,659
switch the Ubuntu or something like that

783
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:55,840
because at the moment there are barely

784
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,310
any attack

785
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:58,810
targeting living death because so food

786
00:34:57,310 --> 00:35:02,380
people uses and those who use it are

787
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:04,540
probably very bad very good that not

788
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:08,110
being so engineered into installing

789
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:09,279
malware but assume that or you've tried

790
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:13,090
to think what it's like if all your

791
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:15,670
family members are running Ubuntu and if

792
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:17,650
they could all be be tricked into

793
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:19,900
running some code from from Stack

794
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:26,920
Exchange or worse just to fix something

795
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:28,630
I mean Linux labs so um IOT an average

796
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:31,150
IOT device we now know that horribly

797
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:33,340
it's your default passwords but not

798
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:35,680
there's a huge vulnerability gap at the

799
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:37,750
same time they often isn't much of a

800
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,640
human interface and not something where

801
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:42,790
you can be clicked IOT vulnerabilities

802
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:45,490
get exported automatically I've never

803
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:47,290
heard of something where someone was was

804
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:50,009
tricked into clicking the link on the

805
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:52,960
connected coffeemaker

806
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:54,340
Android I think okay it's not hard

807
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:57,130
science I think Android is a bit more

808
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:59,530
secure than Windows 10 if only because

809
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:03,700
it's a newer operating system it has all

810
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:05,980
sorts of separation of of processes and

811
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:08,259
stuff like that so it's bit harder to

812
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:09,730
exploit it's still not perfect and from

813
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:13,150
abilities are known especially in older

814
00:36:09,730 --> 00:36:14,800
versions but also you can't run

815
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:17,470
something like PowerShell on an android

816
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:21,130
and and not PowerShell in itself but you

817
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:22,839
can't run code on an Android you can

818
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:24,550
only install apps from the app store

819
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:26,860
unless you go out of your way to enable

820
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:28,810
other other apps and I know the app

821
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:31,540
store isn't perfect but it still keeps

822
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:33,670
away a lot of malware whereas in Windows

823
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:35,080
there is no you're not restricted to

824
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:40,050
using apps from an app store that

825
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:44,200
already makes it easier to it's no more

826
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:45,850
iOS iOS is really secure I think it's

827
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,680
probably the most if your standard

828
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:49,750
operating system we know and it gets a

829
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:52,569
lot of credit for that but also a pom

830
00:36:49,750 --> 00:37:01,810
has a tightly controlled app store the

831
00:36:52,570 --> 00:37:03,460
the gap to install to ability your

832
00:37:01,810 --> 00:37:06,430
ability to install malware on your own

833
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:08,290
iOS iPhone even if you wanted to you

834
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:09,609
have to try really hard you have to root

835
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:11,440
it probably you're fine

836
00:37:09,609 --> 00:37:16,299
Oh break and then do something otherwise

837
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:20,799
you just and so let's think about it for

838
00:37:16,299 --> 00:37:23,619
a second what is the best antivirus this

839
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:28,059
time this is Tim Cook who the current

840
00:37:23,619 --> 00:37:29,619
CEO of Apple and it's less antivirus not

841
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:32,019
so much because of the your operating

842
00:37:29,619 --> 00:37:35,700
system though that helps but because

843
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:38,979
they really control what you can run and

844
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:41,140
I'm sometimes asked like like advice for

845
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:42,609
secure what secure device I say and

846
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:44,049
where it's probably good enough if

847
00:37:42,609 --> 00:37:46,269
you're high value target if you're a

848
00:37:44,049 --> 00:37:48,849
journalist if you're a high-level

849
00:37:46,269 --> 00:37:50,828
politician high end business get an

850
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:52,749
iPhone if you want to support

851
00:37:50,829 --> 00:37:54,400
journalists and that's something I care

852
00:37:52,749 --> 00:37:57,209
about and I think it's not here but it

853
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:59,769
was a guy here from freedom of the press

854
00:37:57,210 --> 00:38:01,809
it's a very important thing digital

855
00:37:59,769 --> 00:38:02,979
attacks against journalists I'm sure to

856
00:38:01,809 --> 00:38:04,989
happen in India that happen all over the

857
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:08,349
world they're a big thing if you want to

858
00:38:04,989 --> 00:38:09,970
help them get them an iPhone I know we

859
00:38:08,349 --> 00:38:12,249
all like open-source tools and open

860
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:14,709
source whatnot and it's great but it's

861
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:16,480
probably easier to just collect some

862
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:17,920
money and then buy them and I've I phone

863
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,670
rather than then test all the

864
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:23,259
open-source tools they use so yeah I

865
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:27,670
phone is really great but there is a

866
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:30,819
flip side to this at all so this is one

867
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:34,749
more thing that I want to show Miko

868
00:38:30,819 --> 00:38:37,119
heapin and one other iPhone turned 10 he

869
00:38:34,749 --> 00:38:39,640
congratulated for no single more a case

870
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:41,710
and this was after the Pegasus attacks

871
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:42,308
and Mamiko later corrected himself say

872
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:44,170
no more

873
00:38:42,309 --> 00:38:46,720
outbreak so the work there has been more

874
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:48,549
were but no outbreak no more targeting

875
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,419
the efforts person and that's still this

876
00:38:48,549 --> 00:38:56,170
year Nava go and it's still still valid

877
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:58,359
so the Chinese government considers VPNs

878
00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:02,410
which essentially is a way to bypass the

879
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:05,140
the Great Firewall as more had I've

880
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:11,799
heard someone say that from someone from

881
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:14,319
the government so China asked Apple to

882
00:39:11,799 --> 00:39:15,460
remove VPN apps from the Chinese App

883
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:18,579
Store

884
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:19,990
Apple compliance now I have an opinion

885
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:22,660
on this I think Apple made the wrong

886
00:39:19,990 --> 00:39:24,279
decision but that's not really my point

887
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:28,348
my point is that Apple has the ability

888
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:31,420
to make that decision and that's scary I

889
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:33,250
mentioned I mention that the Chinese

890
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:34,930
government's convinced economical which

891
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:38,380
is the company behind are going to to

892
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:40,750
remove VPN apps from attitudes for all

893
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:42,220
users in China I would be bad I would

894
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:44,349
say I would go on Twitter saying how bad

895
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:47,078
is that at the same time anyone can

896
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:50,410
download the DB file and then install

897
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:54,520
VPN apps another way you Linux gives you

898
00:39:50,410 --> 00:39:57,430
this power in China

899
00:39:54,520 --> 00:40:00,940
you can't run VPN apps on your iPhone

900
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:02,700
unless you've routed it which yeah which

901
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:07,799
means that the Chinese government and

902
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:12,299
using Apple as a proxy control a lot so

903
00:40:07,799 --> 00:40:14,650
let's see what various things can do to

904
00:40:12,299 --> 00:40:16,390
move your the combination of you and

905
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:18,039
your device on the charge so security

906
00:40:16,390 --> 00:40:19,629
training I don't want to overstate it

907
00:40:18,039 --> 00:40:21,250
but I think it helped to raise some

908
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:24,549
awareness to do some security training

909
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:26,020
and also yeah I would almost say like

910
00:40:24,549 --> 00:40:28,960
being in this room being working

911
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:31,630
security move to device lots to the to

912
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:33,099
the right move sort of the reduce the

913
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,549
ability to be tricked into installing

914
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:37,480
malware

915
00:40:33,549 --> 00:40:39,220
because we know not to enable macros we

916
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:41,260
know what link the more or less know

917
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:43,868
what links to click another click it's a

918
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:46,029
lot harder to social sameiras not

919
00:40:43,869 --> 00:40:48,279
impossible but it's a lot harder most

920
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:48,990
training helps helps abate and moves it

921
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:54,309
in the right direction

922
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:59,229
taxing obviously moves it up because the

923
00:40:54,309 --> 00:41:00,789
for mobility gap is reduced routing may

924
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:02,890
improve some extra vulnerabilities but

925
00:41:00,789 --> 00:41:06,250
more importantly routing makes it easier

926
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:08,440
to install malware on the phone so yeah

927
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:10,150
that's why many companies I think

928
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:14,319
rightly say if you use your personal

929
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:15,970
phone for for your work that's fine but

930
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:17,430
if you're if you routed it then we

931
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:19,209
disconnected from the network and

932
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:22,078
finally there's always a bit of

933
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:25,690
contentious issue and antivirus so and

934
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:28,810
the virus often mitigates sometimes

935
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:31,990
fixes sorta vulnerabilities

936
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:35,049
so it has a lot bort arrow at the same

937
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:36,339
time antivirus blocks a lot of more what

938
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:37,750
if you're trying to install these are

939
00:41:36,340 --> 00:41:39,670
being crate into it so it moves it to

940
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:42,640
the to the right

941
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:46,030
however antivirus being an extra is a

942
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:49,990
software software that runs with a very

943
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:53,020
high permissions also increases its your

944
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:56,109
the attack factor attack surface sorry

945
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:58,120
so it also moves it down a bit now how

946
00:41:56,110 --> 00:42:01,440
large these three arrows are kind of

947
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:04,000
depends on you depends on your device I

948
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,920
I often get asked and it's something

949
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,140
that I spend way too much time

950
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:10,420
discussing things on Twitter but how

951
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:12,129
should you use antivirus my general

952
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:13,720
answer is if you need to ask the

953
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:16,300
question then yes if you need to answer

954
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:18,250
question answer net benefit if you're in

955
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:21,730
this room and you really know your

956
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:24,880
device or if you use an iPhone then then

957
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:28,360
then I'd say maybe not but for most

958
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:34,210
people yeah the the increase of attack

959
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:37,000
surface is just not doesn't outweigh the

960
00:42:34,210 --> 00:42:39,250
increase of of the other two errors

961
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,630
sorry the doesn't outweigh the other two

962
00:42:39,250 --> 00:42:44,590
errors that the net contribution is

963
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:49,030
positive it goes top right but your

964
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:50,890
mileage may vary certain individuals may

965
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:54,220
be would best not use antivirus and just

966
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:56,370
have a very simple lockdown device like

967
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:58,689
an iPhone or an extremely lockdown

968
00:42:56,370 --> 00:43:02,500
Windows version where they just can't do

969
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:04,150
anything bad and of course there's a

970
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:06,370
third dimension or you can think of a

971
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:08,860
third dimension to this through the

972
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:11,020
square it becomes a queue but it's or

973
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:12,400
dimension is how well do attacks scale

974
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:14,800
and that's the reason that no one

975
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:18,130
bothers to attack linux desktops because

976
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:20,560
ladies desktops so few people use it it

977
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:28,270
just doesn't make sense to attack it on

978
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:29,770
any scale so almost done what have we

979
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:31,930
learned last botnets are mostly used for

980
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:34,420
dumb things and that kind of oh let's

981
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:36,970
say on their way out but they're they're

982
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:38,590
not particularly interesting for the

983
00:43:36,970 --> 00:43:41,560
more interesting attacks but that's

984
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:42,230
that's emo dad or or apt groups like

985
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:44,359
Mac's work

986
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:47,630
like hundreds of others it's all about

987
00:43:44,359 --> 00:43:50,569
to download her zero days to matter but

988
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:52,580
only for some don't overestimate them

989
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:55,910
and and full mobility and social

990
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:57,560
engineering both matter and and we

991
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:58,970
especially we as a security community we

992
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:02,990
shouldn't forget the social engineering

993
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:06,950
part this is their this matters and

994
00:44:02,990 --> 00:44:08,149
people are making what are likely from

995
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:09,919
their point of view very rational

996
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:13,790
decisions and still and and get infected

997
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,440
so if you knee question something that

998
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:18,490
there should be time nothing for for

999
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:21,140
questions but you can also email me or

1000
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:25,189
send me a message on Twitter my DMS are

1001
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:34,490
open or at me on LinkedIn or or find me

1002
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:41,000
anytime afterwards thank you any

1003
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:44,569
questions I might tell Martin how nice

1004
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:47,420
presentation about about you saying

1005
00:44:44,570 --> 00:44:50,119
iPhone being more secure than any other

1006
00:44:47,420 --> 00:44:53,060
a couple of months back I was really one

1007
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:56,510
sec one to search document which said he

1008
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:59,840
windows the exe got compiled and it can

1009
00:44:56,510 --> 00:45:02,359
run on an iPhone and on iOS as a malware

1010
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:04,940
and which can easily wait the gatekeeper

1011
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:08,660
of iPhone what is your thought about

1012
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:11,210
that okay so I think what you're

1013
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:15,200
referring to is about Mac OS not about

1014
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:16,640
iPhone I I didn't put Mac OS in that

1015
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:18,919
charts partly because I didn't want to

1016
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:21,410
use too many examples I'm also I don't

1017
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:23,359
know enough about I'm not a Mac user I

1018
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:27,470
don't know enough to comfortably place

1019
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:29,240
it somewhere Mac OS is a lot easy to do

1020
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:32,270
with that what I said about iPhone does

1021
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:33,830
not apply to Mac OS and that's yeah

1022
00:45:32,270 --> 00:45:36,650
that's a good and a bad thing it means

1023
00:45:33,830 --> 00:45:38,810
that an ordinary Mac is still more

1024
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:42,190
perfect again small word there's various

1025
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:44,660
ways to bypass gatekeeper I know that

1026
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:46,910
yeah at the same time it's also more

1027
00:45:44,660 --> 00:45:50,200
flexible that's why Mac OS is popular

1028
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:50,200
among researches yeah

1029
00:45:52,540 --> 00:46:06,380
any other questions there's a lot of

1030
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,960
things which we normally hear that

1031
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:11,510
it's basically takes the partial control

1032
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:13,970
on the computers the malware any any

1033
00:46:11,510 --> 00:46:17,540
system or server computers or anywhere

1034
00:46:13,970 --> 00:46:21,200
even on the hard disk also so if it has

1035
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:23,150
gotta exists on the data and storage of

1036
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:25,460
the PCs or anywhere on the server side

1037
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:29,410
can it delete the data also the malware

1038
00:46:25,460 --> 00:46:33,530
the infected space or the storage space

1039
00:46:29,410 --> 00:46:38,270
has problem through malware to get data

1040
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:43,310
deletion also so if malware gets

1041
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:46,700
injected straight to the the hard disk

1042
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:49,580
can it delete the data also after having

1043
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:50,540
the excess on data and more delete the

1044
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:52,690
data yeah

1045
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:55,160
yes no there is there is coin a lot of

1046
00:46:52,690 --> 00:46:56,900
most more doesn't delete data because it

1047
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:59,450
doesn't make sense because trying to

1048
00:46:56,900 --> 00:47:00,560
make money out of the data right but

1049
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:03,470
there has to be more way that that

1050
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:05,570
either literally literally deletes data

1051
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:06,259
or encrypts it in a way so that no one

1052
00:47:05,570 --> 00:47:08,690
can decrypt it

1053
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:11,420
that's what one acquired it that's what

1054
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:13,820
yeah and that's also been Y prime over

1055
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:15,980
Shamoon is a big one in the Middle East

1056
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:18,170
probably Iran targeting Saudi Arabia

1057
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:21,410
yeah there's been quite a little

1058
00:47:18,170 --> 00:47:23,870
destructive over if you can more where

1059
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:26,930
can delete that in general yes that's a

1060
00:47:23,870 --> 00:47:28,910
B if you say that it in Crete encrypts

1061
00:47:26,930 --> 00:47:30,290
the data also yes so what's the

1062
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:31,670
difference between ransomware and

1063
00:47:30,290 --> 00:47:33,860
malware because ransomware has got the

1064
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:35,990
same ability to encrypt the data and ask

1065
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:37,400
for the ransom right yes the two

1066
00:47:35,990 --> 00:47:39,169
examples are gave it was encrypted

1067
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,850
without without there being at a

1068
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:43,970
decryption key ransomware

1069
00:47:40,850 --> 00:47:46,549
the hurry I I could not hear can you

1070
00:47:43,970 --> 00:47:48,980
repeat okay I was the two examples are

1071
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:51,539
gave called one a crime okay yeah two

1072
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:56,430
very big attacks in 2017

1073
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:58,680
the to both encrypted the disk will were

1074
00:47:56,430 --> 00:48:02,190
looking like ransomware except there was

1075
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:03,720
no decryption mechanism for for the

1076
00:48:02,190 --> 00:48:05,460
ransomware there is a way to do get

1077
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:08,368
there there's a public there's a private

1078
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:11,069
key kept by the authors but also some

1079
00:48:08,369 --> 00:48:14,339
some data on a computer that helps you

1080
00:48:11,069 --> 00:48:16,250
identify the files want to cry and not

1081
00:48:14,339 --> 00:48:19,529
batch they didn't do that so and

1082
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:21,089
encrypting something without and then

1083
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:23,010
throwing away the private key which is

1084
00:48:21,089 --> 00:48:24,509
essentially what what happens it is

1085
00:48:23,010 --> 00:48:26,910
essentially the same as destroying the

1086
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:28,349
data so it was made to look like

1087
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:30,210
ransomware that that confuses people

1088
00:48:28,349 --> 00:48:32,069
that slowed things down people thought

1089
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:33,569
oh yeah it's a big ransomware attack we

1090
00:48:32,069 --> 00:48:35,069
know how to deal with that them and

1091
00:48:33,569 --> 00:48:37,200
actually it turns out it was destructive

1092
00:48:35,069 --> 00:48:39,420
alright so what I understood last line

1093
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,788
the major difference is that ransomware

1094
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:43,349
has got the private key yes but the

1095
00:48:41,789 --> 00:48:44,880
malware it's more or less like a

1096
00:48:43,349 --> 00:48:46,920
deleting the data by encrypting there is

1097
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:49,200
no private key for malware right yeah

1098
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:50,519
well when more I'm a lot of more work

1099
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,828
doesn't decrypt it doesn't destroy data

1100
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:55,109
but more and more dos destroy data there

1101
00:48:52,829 --> 00:49:01,549
is no private key all right all right

1102
00:48:55,109 --> 00:49:01,549
thank you thank you I know the questions

1103
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:07,670
[Music]

1104
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:11,788
I'll be around for the next two days so

1105
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:13,380
feel free to grab me and ask question

1106
00:49:11,789 --> 00:49:16,470
more more personally and thanks also to

1107
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:18,240
the person who who who's your laptop I'm

1108
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:20,368
using now because I'm using a Chromebook

1109
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:24,049
which is very good against more work but

1110
00:49:20,369 --> 00:49:24,049
not very good for presentations
