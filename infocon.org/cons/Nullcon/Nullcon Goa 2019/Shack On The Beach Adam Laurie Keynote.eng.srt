1
00:00:03,009 --> 00:00:09,440
thank you well you've all seen my slides

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:13,190
now so I can just go right I was a bit

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:21,680
worried when I saw a theme playing with

4
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:33,710
my laptop throughout there why is it not

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:36,410
coming up okay so this is my third year

6
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:39,560
at närcon and surprisingly they keep

7
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,910
asking me back so thank you it's the

8
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,350
first year I've actually been asked to

9
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:44,110
give a talk I think I've only done

10
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,820
training here right I've never spoken

11
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:49,070
and you know what it's like when you

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,510
first do something for someone you don't

13
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:52,880
want it to be the most difficult thing

14
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:54,559
that they can ask you to do so they

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,520
asked me to do the keynote so no

16
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,239
pressure Thanks

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:03,070
entrance I also really like the

18
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:06,580
community spirit here I've been part of

19
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:09,140
community hacker conferences like DEFCON

20
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:11,810
for over 20 years now

21
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:14,450
I run the London DEFCON group so if any

22
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,340
of you ever come to London we're the

23
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:21,530
last Tuesday of the month you're welcome

24
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:24,830
it's open it's in a pub so we do a lot

25
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:26,840
of drinking and talking but mostly

26
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:31,009
talking obviously because we're

27
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,630
responsible hackers right and so I

28
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:34,640
didn't have a when I was asked to do the

29
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:36,289
keynote I didn't have a title for the

30
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,049
talk so someone asked me what's the

31
00:01:36,290 --> 00:01:41,600
title and we were sitting in the shack

32
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:43,670
on the beach having dinner so that's

33
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:45,350
like shack on the beach and I'll just

34
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,990
cross out the S cuz that's a really good

35
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:50,750
pun as a hacker pun right so hack on the

36
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:52,280
beach so it's got nothing to do with

37
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:55,280
beaches and it's got nothing to do with

38
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:58,159
hacking on the beach that was just

39
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,470
something I had to put on the slide they

40
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,000
also asked me what what t-shirt am I

41
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:06,740
gonna wear I'm gonna wear a Def Con

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,199
t-shirt or a null Khan t-shirt as you

43
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:10,728
can see I'm wearing neither I come from

44
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:12,858
a really tiny village in the middle of

45
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:15,730
nowhere in in southern England

46
00:02:12,859 --> 00:02:19,269
and one of my neighbors is a dairy farm

47
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:20,798
and so he has a lot of cows and a lot in

48
00:02:19,269 --> 00:02:24,640
it they make cheese his family's been

49
00:02:20,799 --> 00:02:25,420
making cheese for about 300 years and as

50
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,450
a farmer

51
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:30,429
he's interested in you know he has to

52
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:34,030
get up early in the morning and he likes

53
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:35,319
a drink because he's a farmer and he

54
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,310
likes to get up in the morning and not

55
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:38,858
have a hangover

56
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:41,409
but he also likes free booze so he's

57
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:43,120
like okay I'm a farmer I've got all

58
00:02:41,409 --> 00:02:45,608
these raw materials I should be able to

59
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,650
make my own booze right so he tried

60
00:02:45,609 --> 00:02:49,599
everything he tried potatoes he tried

61
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:52,510
grain he tried whatever to make vodka

62
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,429
and in the end he realized his his

63
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:56,439
family business which makes cheese they

64
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:59,290
have a byproduct when you make cheese

65
00:02:56,439 --> 00:03:01,510
which is whey which is normally excuse

66
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:05,319
me there's normally turned into animal

67
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:09,250
feed so he tried making vodka from that

68
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:10,899
and guess what it's really good so he

69
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,010
now makes this stuff called black cow

70
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:17,500
vodka which is pure milk vodka and since

71
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:21,819
cows are sacred here right

72
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:24,489
that's like holy water so so I thought

73
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:26,440
this was appropriate to wear and I have

74
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:28,329
some with me so if anyone wants a taste

75
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:31,209
come and have some holy water with me

76
00:03:28,329 --> 00:03:34,030
after the conference so that's why I'm

77
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:39,790
wearing this okay

78
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:41,889
so what am I going to talk about well

79
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:43,530
you know when you give a keynote you

80
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:46,659
have to give some words of wisdom right

81
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:49,199
I'm not sure there'll be words of wisdom

82
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:52,418
there'll be words almost guarantee that

83
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:54,280
I'm gonna talk about what's going to

84
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:57,099
happen I can see into the future I know

85
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,449
everything that's going to happen and I

86
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:00,668
get to say I told you so

87
00:03:58,449 --> 00:04:03,849
and of course I will give you the

88
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:07,030
winning lottery numbers too because I

89
00:04:03,849 --> 00:04:08,500
can no I have no idea what I was going

90
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:11,739
to talk about when he asked me to do

91
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:16,149
this so I just thought I'd talk about

92
00:04:11,739 --> 00:04:20,739
you know my experience I've been a white

93
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:22,659
hat hacker since the 80s I did a lot of

94
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:24,549
talks I've done a series of talks called

95
00:04:22,659 --> 00:04:27,460
old school hacking because I realized a

96
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:29,380
while ago I'm kind of getting old you

97
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:31,810
know I was

98
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:34,300
at a conference and someone the speaker

99
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:37,920
before me said oh it's so nice to see so

100
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:42,490
many old-timers here I'm like really I

101
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:45,520
wait I am old so I prefer the term old

102
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:48,760
school not Alzheimer but basically I am

103
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:53,039
an old-timer as I say I've been doing

104
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:55,480
this for a long time so long in fact

105
00:04:53,040 --> 00:05:00,220
that when I started we didn't have any

106
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:04,080
of this stuff how many people here have

107
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:07,570
had mobile phones since they remember

108
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:10,930
seriously none of you you all as old as

109
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:12,280
me Wow okay well I can give up on this

110
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:13,660
talk that I thought was gonna be a room

111
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,380
full of young people that didn't

112
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:18,850
remember the time before the internet so

113
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,159
yeah we didn't have all that when I

114
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:25,660
started mobile phones were these big

115
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:28,960
clunky portable brick things internet

116
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:31,200
literally didn't exist you had to dial

117
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,109
into networks and so on

118
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:38,680
so yeah we didn't have any of that so we

119
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:42,310
invented all that when I say we I

120
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:46,930
don't mean me but you're welcome the

121
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:51,280
next generation so how did I get into

122
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:54,490
all this stuff well I'm kind of an early

123
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,830
adopter because I had to sew for work

124
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:59,080
not because I'm a fanboy and I go out

125
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:02,680
and buy the latest Apple or i buy the

126
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:06,430
the latest Android I didn't get into

127
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:09,520
iPhones until about the third generation

128
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:11,440
I would say because you know they

129
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,330
weren't very good the first ones my

130
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,120
Nakia actually worked a hell of a lot

131
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:19,080
better than the first apples but when

132
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:22,000
they got good then I switched and

133
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:24,370
started to need to use them because you

134
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,580
know they start to become relevant to to

135
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,580
work

136
00:06:29,299 --> 00:06:35,489
same with Android I mean I think I

137
00:06:31,769 --> 00:06:38,189
switched from iPhone to Android on about

138
00:06:35,489 --> 00:06:40,799
third or fourth generation devices when

139
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:44,489
it actually started not being slow and

140
00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:46,498
clunky and crashing all the time and I

141
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:50,938
preferred Android because of the more

142
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:54,179
open environment so I'm a I'm a very

143
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:57,119
much an open source guy pretty much

144
00:06:54,179 --> 00:06:59,748
everything I do I publish if I can so

145
00:06:57,119 --> 00:07:03,449
you'll find a lot of my work on github

146
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:07,589
I've been you know giving talks for as I

147
00:07:03,449 --> 00:07:12,299
say about well not the full 20 years in

148
00:07:07,589 --> 00:07:14,519
fact in the early days at Def Con so I

149
00:07:12,299 --> 00:07:18,119
in in the opening slide you'll see my

150
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:19,889
name was Adam major malfunction Lori so

151
00:07:18,119 --> 00:07:23,449
I'm known at DEFCON as major malfunction

152
00:07:19,889 --> 00:07:26,299
so that's my handle and for the first

153
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:30,349
probably 10 years of going to DEFCON

154
00:07:26,299 --> 00:07:33,269
that was the only name people knew me by

155
00:07:30,349 --> 00:07:35,759
nobody knew my real name and the reason

156
00:07:33,269 --> 00:07:38,459
for that was not because I was a you

157
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:42,239
know an evil hacker hiding and doing bad

158
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:46,079
stuff but because the world wasn't ready

159
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:48,899
for us white hat hackers wasn't a thing

160
00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:49,799
20 years ago hackers were just hackers

161
00:07:48,899 --> 00:07:53,219
and bad guys

162
00:07:49,799 --> 00:07:55,138
and so Def Con did actually start as a

163
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:57,899
kind of underground conference you know

164
00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:00,749
there was a bunch of I think one of the

165
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:03,329
the audience who was talking about their

166
00:08:00,749 --> 00:08:04,619
experience said they'd like to come here

167
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:06,689
because they meet people they don't

168
00:08:04,619 --> 00:08:10,889
normally get to me that they only have a

169
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:13,289
virtual relationship with and that's how

170
00:08:10,889 --> 00:08:16,169
Def Con started you know when I first

171
00:08:13,289 --> 00:08:20,579
went to Def Con I think there were 60

172
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:23,599
people there and I turned out I knew

173
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:25,829
about half of them from online

174
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:28,829
connections so these were people I was

175
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:31,679
meeting in bulletin boards in those days

176
00:08:28,829 --> 00:08:33,599
it was like fidonet and and the internet

177
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:35,188
was just starting and so I had I had

178
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,469
relationships with people all over the

179
00:08:35,188 --> 00:08:40,049
world but only through email and only

180
00:08:37,469 --> 00:08:42,930
through chat forums and only through

181
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:44,519
playing multi-user games together which

182
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:51,300
were very primitive in those days it was

183
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:53,670
just text-based stuff and so I started

184
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,349
going regularly to Def Con I wasn't

185
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:56,819
speaking then for the first ten years I

186
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,410
was basically I got roped into being

187
00:08:56,819 --> 00:09:00,959
staffed pretty much straight away I

188
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:04,230
think I had one Def Con where I wasn't

189
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,219
staff which didn't actually use to

190
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:07,560
matter in the early days because

191
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:09,180
everything happened in one room so even

192
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,439
if you were working you were working in

193
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,878
the room where the talks were being

194
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:14,779
given so you actually got to see the

195
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:18,629
talks and I started on the network team

196
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:22,709
and then I migrated to I created what I

197
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:24,930
called jokingly QM stores which is the

198
00:09:22,709 --> 00:09:26,790
quartermaster stores and basically that

199
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:29,489
was the cupboard in my bedroom at the

200
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:31,469
hotel where I just put stuff that needed

201
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:33,839
to be put away at night and that's grew

202
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:38,480
and grew and grew and grew and now I

203
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:42,089
have a staff of 18 and we load in six

204
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:45,300
full arctic truck loads of equipment I

205
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:48,569
think 70 pallets stacked about 8 foot

206
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:49,670
high each of gear and that's what runs

207
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:53,130
Def Con now

208
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:55,229
so I'm busy I'd sit in a room throughout

209
00:09:53,130 --> 00:10:00,029
the entire conference never see any

210
00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:02,720
talks anyway I'm I will ramble by the

211
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:09,329
way this is what I do when I get started

212
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:11,519
so for the first ten years I couldn't

213
00:10:09,329 --> 00:10:14,779
tell anyone my real name because I was

214
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:17,970
afraid that if my customers in the UK

215
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:20,370
heard that I was going to a hacker

216
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:22,470
conference then they wouldn't trust me

217
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:25,259
anymore and I would lose my clients and

218
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:27,839
my company would get in trouble for

219
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:29,699
going to a cat conferences and so on so

220
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,689
literally for the first ten years I had

221
00:10:29,699 --> 00:10:35,729
to go in secret kind of happily that's

222
00:10:33,689 --> 00:10:39,269
all changed now and I think you know

223
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:43,620
DEFCON is is in a large way responsible

224
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:46,110
for that we had a lot of pushback from

225
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,240
vendors originally we would publish

226
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,829
stuff and they would get upset and there

227
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,250
would be lawsuits and you guys are

228
00:10:49,829 --> 00:10:57,779
getting that now and I'd you know

229
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:59,370
I guess this industry is fairly new over

230
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:01,980
here and so you're going through those

231
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:04,500
same growing pains where that the

232
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:07,410
government and the industry don't

233
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,730
understand that this is actually you

234
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,589
know there is such a thing as a white

235
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:12,720
hat there is a good reason why we should

236
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:15,149
be hacking stuff and actually it's for

237
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,420
everyone's benefit in the long run and

238
00:11:15,149 --> 00:11:20,430
it took a long time for the industry in

239
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:22,110
the US and in the way in the West to

240
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:24,810
understand that but they did in the end

241
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:27,259
and and you know that the the big change

242
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:30,839
came one year where Microsoft came along

243
00:11:27,259 --> 00:11:32,519
and they said well you know we're we're

244
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:34,829
gonna release a new version this year

245
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:38,100
and every time we do it you guys just

246
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:39,899
hack the crap out of it so rather than

247
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,939
doing that this time we're going to tell

248
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:45,810
you in advance what our plans are and

249
00:11:41,939 --> 00:11:47,189
please give us some feedback and that

250
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,170
changed everything and then all the

251
00:11:47,189 --> 00:11:50,849
other vendors started doing the same and

252
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:52,680
they actually set up a security at

253
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:57,060
Microsoft's comm and so on and that was

254
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:59,099
all new in those days so so I've seen it

255
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,319
kind of evolve and I as I say it looks

256
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:06,389
like it's evolving similarly over here

257
00:12:01,319 --> 00:12:08,040
now so so basically the reason I poke

258
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:11,519
around in this stuff is because I need

259
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,410
to use this stuff for work I need the

260
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,899
stuff to work and to actually be secure

261
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:17,309
so again you know why are you hacking my

262
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:19,050
product well because you said it's

263
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:25,379
secure and it isn't and I need it to be

264
00:12:19,050 --> 00:12:29,689
so so I started life working for a

265
00:12:25,379 --> 00:12:32,029
database company I was in the

266
00:12:29,689 --> 00:12:35,610
integration and support and distribution

267
00:12:32,029 --> 00:12:37,829
department in fact I ran it and again

268
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:40,319
this is going what so far back that

269
00:12:37,829 --> 00:12:42,300
machines didn't have any kind of

270
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:44,269
standard there was no standard floppy

271
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,979
disk format that worked in every machine

272
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:51,149
so when we wanted to distribute our

273
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:53,639
software on a different brand of PC I

274
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:56,279
had to figure out how to copy the data

275
00:12:53,639 --> 00:13:00,480
on to that particular pcs floppy disk

276
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:02,670
format and unbelievably mag tapes there

277
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,790
was no such thing as a CD or a DVD there

278
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:06,990
were no USB sticks no internet

279
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:10,910
we didn't even actually have

280
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:10,910
wired networks in the really early days

281
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:20,820
so out out of that spun off a business

282
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:23,219
so I realized a lot of our customers had

283
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:26,270
the same problem so people who were

284
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:28,740
buying the software for the database

285
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:31,470
also had other things they needed to

286
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:34,680
move between these different systems so

287
00:13:31,470 --> 00:13:37,589
on the side I set up a media conversion

288
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:40,290
business and so after work at the

289
00:13:37,589 --> 00:13:41,670
database company in the evenings I would

290
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:44,459
use that equipment to run my own

291
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:48,449
business moving data around for other

292
00:13:44,459 --> 00:13:52,709
companies and then that split off into

293
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:54,540
some vertical markets so you know again

294
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:56,219
this is all new stuff you know people

295
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:59,010
who are using computers for the first

296
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,750
time in their businesses if they come

297
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:04,020
across someone who's providing a service

298
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:05,760
and we we started to see a lot of

299
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:08,610
desktop publishing data being moved

300
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,319
around between these systems so it was

301
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:12,600
obvious to us well we should just spin

302
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:17,190
off a desktop publishing company and

303
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:20,279
start doing the same stuff so and yeah

304
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:23,310
even mag tape duplication again you know

305
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:26,220
this is this looks pretty old-school but

306
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:28,589
those big half-inch tapes were still

307
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:38,399
being used and needed to be duplicated

308
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:41,760
and distributed and so on so and I got

309
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:44,399
into batch printing so you would get a

310
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:47,100
database and you print off letters

311
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,950
individually addressed and so on again

312
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:53,029
pretty everyday stuff these days but

313
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:57,899
then it was new no one was doing it

314
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:59,700
floppy disk duplication so back in those

315
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:01,589
days when you bought a computer magazine

316
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,690
there would be a floppy disk stuck on

317
00:15:01,589 --> 00:15:07,200
the front and it would have the latest

318
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:11,790
games or demos or whatever and so my

319
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:13,260
company was mass producing those so we

320
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:15,870
would get a master disc and then we'd

321
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:19,380
produce 50,000 or 100,000 copies of

322
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:20,880
those discs which was yeah a terrible

323
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,380
idea in my office

324
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,820
because we actually were on the top

325
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:26,189
floor of a building that just had a

326
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:28,500
single man lift and so we were

327
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:30,360
constantly loading these you know tens

328
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,920
of thousands of floppy disks into this

329
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,410
tiny little lift taking them upstairs

330
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:39,540
duping them taking them down again it

331
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:41,490
was a nightmare but that led to CD

332
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:43,349
mastering so basically what happened

333
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:45,090
with the magazines is they started

334
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:48,660
putting so much content on that you

335
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:51,630
would end up with two or three floppies

336
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:54,420
on the front of every magazine in order

337
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:57,780
to try and put as much as you could on

338
00:15:54,420 --> 00:16:01,500
there and it was it was too much so

339
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:03,180
anyway when CDs came along I proposed to

340
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:05,610
one of the magazine companies that we

341
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:09,209
should actually put a CD on the front of

342
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:11,700
the magazine and in order to create that

343
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:14,460
CD I started working with a company

344
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:20,240
called Nimbus Records who are one of the

345
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:23,460
first companies in the UK to produce CDs

346
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,800
and this is where it started to get

347
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:29,820
really interesting because in order to

348
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:32,189
actually produce a CD that would be

349
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:36,030
useful to enough people to make it

350
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:37,980
worthwhile we had to actually look at

351
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:41,130
the low-level format of the CD and say

352
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:44,160
well is it possible to produce a CD that

353
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:46,170
if you stick it in a Windows machine

354
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,900
it's gonna work and if you stick it in a

355
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:50,760
Mac it's gonna work again this sounds

356
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,740
fairly mundane now it's a it's a

357
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:55,260
standard thing but there was no standard

358
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,940
at the time for doing that so we had to

359
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:59,340
get right down and dirty and start

360
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:02,610
playing with the low-level data to

361
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:05,970
figure out how to do that and when I was

362
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:10,319
doing that talking to the guy at Nimbus

363
00:17:05,970 --> 00:17:12,209
records he basically said he taught me

364
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:16,438
how it all worked and the low level or

365
00:17:12,209 --> 00:17:20,130
honor on our CD worked how many of you

366
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:23,400
know how a CD works a few getting a few

367
00:17:20,130 --> 00:17:27,180
nods okay so it's like a record you know

368
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:33,240
you've got a a spiral track on the CD

369
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:34,680
and it's the motor is variable speed so

370
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,450
that the data bits have to

371
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,610
go past the head at the same speed

372
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:41,820
regardless of where on the disk you are

373
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:44,219
now obviously if the the disk was

374
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:46,200
spinning at the same speed the outer

375
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,820
tracks are going to go by way faster

376
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,370
than the inner tracks by the time you

377
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:53,850
get out there so the motor varies speed

378
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:55,679
and it does this because the track is

379
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:57,750
not a perfect circle it's actually

380
00:17:55,680 --> 00:18:00,870
wobbling the whole way it's like a wavy

381
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:03,480
line and so the head has to do this in

382
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:05,729
order to follow it and it does that at a

383
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,870
particular speed and by maintaining that

384
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:11,820
speed and varying the speed of the spin

385
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:13,889
in order that that wobble stays at the

386
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:16,950
same rate you get your variable speed

387
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:19,350
spin so I was talking to this guy at

388
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:22,680
Nimbus and he explained all this and I'm

389
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:24,840
like so what happens if we you know half

390
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:27,690
the size of the dots that you're reading

391
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:32,220
and double the speed of the the wobble

392
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:34,830
and just let the whole thing slow down

393
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:37,410
could we get double the data on on the

394
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:40,770
CD and he's like I don't know let's try

395
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:43,230
it so you know he has all the equipment

396
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:47,370
to produce this stuff so we tried it and

397
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:49,830
the damn thing worked and we tried it in

398
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:52,830
so he produced some music CDs he

399
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:54,870
produced some data CDs and we tried it

400
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:58,010
in every commercial CD player we could

401
00:18:54,870 --> 00:19:01,560
find on the market and it just worked so

402
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:06,030
I don't know if you remember but you

403
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:07,800
know CDs were 60 minutes but they could

404
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:09,330
have been 120 minutes maybe they could

405
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,240
have even been 180 minutes

406
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:16,770
and it was a big deal that you could

407
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:19,560
only fit so much data on a CD but nobody

408
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:21,389
you know nobody did anything with it I

409
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:25,800
don't know why so he could have had

410
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:28,320
double size CDs right from day one the

411
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:31,080
other thing I came across which at the

412
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:34,939
time was interesting so readwrite media

413
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:37,139
had just come out so burnable CDs and

414
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:38,940
there was a lot of stuff in the press

415
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:40,860
about you know are you gonna do your

416
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,020
backups to a burnable CD and then lose

417
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:45,240
them because they're you know how long

418
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:47,040
is it going to last and so on so they're

419
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,269
all these tests and you know published

420
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:50,519
articles saying

421
00:19:48,269 --> 00:19:54,119
oh yeah we've tested it all it last ten

422
00:19:50,519 --> 00:19:56,159
years so I actually did an experiment

423
00:19:54,119 --> 00:20:00,149
I'd I burned

424
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:03,239
I think about a dozen CDs and I just

425
00:20:00,149 --> 00:20:04,799
left them outdoors in the sunlight so in

426
00:20:03,239 --> 00:20:08,209
a waterproof case so it wasn't going to

427
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:10,769
get wet but just sitting in the Sun and

428
00:20:08,209 --> 00:20:12,389
then every week we would bring one in

429
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:13,979
and we would try and read it or we'd

430
00:20:12,389 --> 00:20:17,758
bring a bunch of them in try and read

431
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:20,459
them and after about six weeks in direct

432
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:23,599
sunlight they started failing even

433
00:20:20,459 --> 00:20:26,190
though these reports basically said no

434
00:20:23,599 --> 00:20:29,579
they'll last ten years we've done these

435
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:33,719
tests on the ink it's it's gonna last

436
00:20:29,579 --> 00:20:35,908
ten years but they had completely fudged

437
00:20:33,719 --> 00:20:39,690
the test they basically did the testing

438
00:20:35,909 --> 00:20:42,899
on unused media so if you take a blank

439
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:46,079
disk that's never been used yes that ink

440
00:20:42,899 --> 00:20:48,178
will last ten years but the way a

441
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:51,739
rewritable CD works is the laser

442
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:54,269
actually breaks down the compound and

443
00:20:51,739 --> 00:20:56,999
changes its structure so once you've

444
00:20:54,269 --> 00:21:00,289
actually written to the disk then

445
00:20:56,999 --> 00:21:03,149
sunlight does affect it so the whole

446
00:21:00,289 --> 00:21:07,109
rewritable CD industry was based on a

447
00:21:03,149 --> 00:21:12,178
total lie basically so anyway playing

448
00:21:07,109 --> 00:21:14,070
with CDs led me to understand a lot

449
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:18,239
about how stuff worked under the hood

450
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:21,928
and as si mentioned I ended up writing

451
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:26,759
the first CD Ripper which was called CD

452
00:21:21,929 --> 00:21:29,009
grab and I had a lot of discussions at

453
00:21:26,759 --> 00:21:31,859
the time with you know knowledgeable

454
00:21:29,009 --> 00:21:33,809
knowledgeable people in the industry who

455
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:36,928
said well it couldn't be done you can't

456
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:40,109
read data from a music CD that's just

457
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:42,329
not how it works and you know to me that

458
00:21:40,109 --> 00:21:46,139
made no sense I'm like well the whole

459
00:21:42,329 --> 00:21:48,269
point is it's digital data so clearly if

460
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:49,678
there's digital data on this disc I

461
00:21:48,269 --> 00:21:52,559
should be able to just get the bits and

462
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:57,089
bytes off so I had online arguments with

463
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:58,440
some guys and some guys from Sony said

464
00:21:57,089 --> 00:22:01,168
no you you know it doesn't work like

465
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,250
that you can't do it and then one of the

466
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:06,780
CD manufacturer

467
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:09,809
came along that the guys who made the CD

468
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:11,428
drives four pcs and said well we'd be

469
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:13,799
really interested if you can get it

470
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:16,380
working so you know here's some

471
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:20,190
equipment and here's the source code for

472
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:24,020
our driver and in those days you had to

473
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:28,580
load a shim underdose called MSE DX

474
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:30,770
which was the CD sort of

475
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:34,020
man-in-the-middle module for Windows

476
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:36,539
that offer dos that allowed your

477
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:38,460
software to talk to the CD drive and

478
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:40,760
when I looked at their source code I

479
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:44,370
realized that they were actually

480
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:47,370
deliberately blocking so there was a one

481
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:50,039
bit setting which said this is a music

482
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:52,020
disc or a data disc and if it saw that

483
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:54,900
bit was set for music disc then it

484
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:57,980
refused to pass any data so literally I

485
00:22:54,900 --> 00:23:01,620
had to make a one bit change or one byte

486
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:04,140
comparison change to the code to switch

487
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:07,520
off that check and bingo it started

488
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:10,350
sending me data so I was able to produce

489
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:15,120
software that could actually read raw

490
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:17,100
audio directly from the disk this was

491
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,340
really back in the day so before

492
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:22,559
open-source was a big thing and I didn't

493
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:25,668
understand the open source model hadn't

494
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:28,289
really heard of it so he published it

495
00:23:25,669 --> 00:23:30,419
and we gave away a free version that was

496
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:32,158
kind of limited functionality and then

497
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:35,610
we charged like 50 quid

498
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,500
for the real version that could rip more

499
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:39,330
than ten seconds worth of music and you

500
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,980
could so you could use the free one to

501
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:43,918
check that it actually worked and then

502
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:47,520
if it did you buy the 50 quid version

503
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:50,220
you can rip the whole thing at the time

504
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:54,929
the hard disk a 600 make hard disk I

505
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:58,799
think a CD cost 15 pounds and a 600 Meg

506
00:23:54,929 --> 00:24:00,630
hard disk cost about 300 pounds so if

507
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:02,700
you ripped a CD you were gonna fill up

508
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:04,520
300 quids worth of hard disk with

509
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:08,760
something you just bought for 15 quid

510
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:11,250
didn't really make a lot of sense so not

511
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:14,129
many people were using it

512
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:19,350
but one of the people who came and

513
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:23,130
purchased it was building a satellite

514
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:28,320
radio station and they wanted to

515
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:31,980
transmit raw uncompressed audio so they

516
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:34,679
wanted to rip CDs and create a huge

517
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:38,880
library of all the music they wanted to

518
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:41,630
transmit 64 channels of what's called

519
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:44,250
music so basically it's being piped into

520
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:51,060
commercial premises who want rock music

521
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:54,810
or you know country music or whatever

522
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:55,710
piped into their their business anyone

523
00:24:54,810 --> 00:25:02,129
heard of QNX

524
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:03,750
a few of you so QX was awesome it's the

525
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:06,260
most amazing operating system it's

526
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:09,500
basically real-time Unix

527
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:11,910
so if you want to do anything real-time

528
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:13,980
you just ran it it was just like normal

529
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:15,870
UNIX there was nothing clever or fancy

530
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,780
you had to do it just prioritized

531
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:22,050
everything to try and make it real time

532
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:23,610
and it did it incredibly well I think

533
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:25,560
they were bought in the end by

534
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:28,169
blackberry or RIM

535
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,919
I don't know what's happened to it since

536
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:33,660
does anyone know is Q and X still around

537
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,490
yeah still awesome

538
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:37,830
I love Q net so I haven't got to use it

539
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:43,470
for anything else but it saved our bacon

540
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:46,679
on this job so yeah this was an

541
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:48,960
interesting project the good side of the

542
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:51,540
project was they were up against a

543
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:55,890
really tight time scale because they had

544
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:57,899
just passed away two years of time that

545
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:59,700
they had to get this thing going they

546
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:02,130
they already had an uplink running in

547
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:05,280
the US and they needed to bring it to

548
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:08,100
the UK and they had just failed that

549
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:10,050
just failed to do it so their vendors

550
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,449
were saying to them oh you need bigger

551
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:14,050
tin you need more you know processing

552
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:16,060
power

553
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:19,230
and I was called into this meeting

554
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:22,690
because they had you know they'd bought

555
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:27,670
they'd bought CD grab in order to grab

556
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:29,200
the the music and they'd told me what

557
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:31,570
the project was and we had had a chat

558
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:35,230
about it and he had explained they're

559
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:38,260
doing this thing with 64 channels and I

560
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:39,820
was like wow that's a lot of data are

561
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:43,660
you sure you're going to be able to push

562
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:45,010
that through a single server and he's

563
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,420
like yeah yeah ya know the vendors

564
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:49,000
assure us it's gonna be fine

565
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:50,980
so he called me to the meeting and this

566
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,660
was like you know a few days later this

567
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:55,330
was the sign-off meeting where they were

568
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:58,030
about to hand this vendor a check for

569
00:26:55,330 --> 00:27:01,060
like millions of pounds to provide all

570
00:26:58,030 --> 00:27:02,649
this hardware and this was just the you

571
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:04,090
know meet and greet and everyone smile

572
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:08,350
and here's your check and let's get

573
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:09,850
going and so I went to this meeting and

574
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:13,780
I drew a little diagram on the

575
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:18,040
whiteboard and I'm like okay so here's

576
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:22,389
your server with its 110 megabit network

577
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:26,950
port and here's your uplink and you're

578
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:28,960
gonna do what is the number 75 frames a

579
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:30,430
second of two hundred and thirty two

580
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,920
thousand three hundred and fifty two

581
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:36,430
bytes that's one hundred and seventy-six

582
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:39,730
K per channel K bytes per channel and

583
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:44,680
you've got 64 of those so basically you

584
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:47,860
need 128 megabytes of data to go through

585
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:50,500
this system in those days that was a

586
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:55,570
seriously big deal okay we had 10

587
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:57,100
megabit networking at this point so they

588
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:59,530
put the check back in their pocket and

589
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:03,429
they left the meeting and the vendor was

590
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:07,090
very unhappy and they said to us help

591
00:28:03,430 --> 00:28:09,700
what do we do so anyway we got the

592
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:13,169
project and because they were so

593
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:16,570
desperate and it was a big you know big

594
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:18,700
conglomerate of multinationals they had

595
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:20,439
a lot of cash and they would just like

596
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:23,410
just do whatever it takes

597
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:25,450
spend the money get it done so we were

598
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:27,190
just buying equipment and testing it we

599
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:28,090
didn't have to scope anything was just

600
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:30,130
like well maybe that

601
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:33,039
work right by one get it here let's test

602
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:35,169
it so that was quite fun the other thing

603
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:39,700
that came out of that is we needed a

604
00:28:35,169 --> 00:28:45,789
programming team that worked on a big

605
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:48,159
project in a very short time span and so

606
00:28:45,789 --> 00:28:51,460
this is where I mean again this is

607
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:53,890
before the internet and before you know

608
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:57,789
that level of communication was common

609
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:59,679
we actually had teams all over the world

610
00:28:57,789 --> 00:29:01,690
so we had a team in Australia we had a

611
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:05,320
team in the US and we had a team in the

612
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:08,470
UK and so we were able to work around

613
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:10,629
the clock 24/7 on this project and we

614
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:12,700
had like shared code repositories and so

615
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:15,429
on and again you know this is before

616
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:17,919
github and so on so this all had to be

617
00:29:15,429 --> 00:29:23,470
kind of invented on the fly how do we do

618
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:25,870
all this stuff but it was great you know

619
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:30,309
to see that evolve and to get that kind

620
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:32,110
of process working so the bad side of

621
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:35,799
this was nothing actually worked as

622
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:37,779
advertised the manufacturers of the

623
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:40,990
networks which again this was a big deal

624
00:29:37,779 --> 00:29:44,799
at the time we found someone who had 128

625
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:49,210
port 10 megabit switch and they claimed

626
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:51,429
that you could absolutely you know you

627
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:53,710
could push the full 10 Meg through all

628
00:29:51,429 --> 00:29:58,210
128 ports all the time and it would just

629
00:29:53,710 --> 00:30:00,340
work no problem that was a lie the thing

630
00:29:58,210 --> 00:30:04,179
crashed as soon as we actually had more

631
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:06,189
than about 20 channels going and it

632
00:30:04,179 --> 00:30:10,120
turned out that all the testing they had

633
00:30:06,190 --> 00:30:13,149
done was to do with number of packets so

634
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,559
they were sending packets we could never

635
00:30:13,149 --> 00:30:16,959
get them to tell us well how big were

636
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:18,549
those packets we can do a quick bit of

637
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:21,159
maths and work out how much you're

638
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:22,990
pushing through this switch but all of

639
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:25,000
the tests they had ever done and all of

640
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:26,740
the proofs they had for their

641
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,929
performance were to do with numbers of

642
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:33,760
packets not actual data throughput so

643
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:36,549
that was painful there was a very very

644
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,710
very expensive switch and they basically

645
00:30:36,549 --> 00:30:41,860
had to shut down manufacturer of the

646
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:44,500
switch and redesign

647
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:50,709
all their VLSI chips and so on to make

648
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:54,309
it work the other thing was we had CD

649
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:57,039
jukeboxes each each jukebox had four

650
00:30:54,309 --> 00:30:59,379
players in it so we were ripping CDs

651
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:01,629
this is kind of funny we were ripping

652
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:03,940
CDs but because of the cost of hard

653
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:07,390
disks we were then burning them back to

654
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:10,330
data CDs so you had a music CD that was

655
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:14,260
converted the exact same music back on

656
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:17,830
to a data CD as files instead of a

657
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:20,440
Redbook audio but we then had these

658
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:24,279
jukeboxes which had 500 discs in each

659
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:26,200
shoebox and four players and again it

660
00:31:24,279 --> 00:31:27,909
didn't work as advertised it turned out

661
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:33,070
that every time you send a scuzzy

662
00:31:27,909 --> 00:31:34,630
command to the device it would have a

663
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:42,639
ten-second pause while it thought about

664
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:44,289
it which was not good and then what came

665
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:47,408
out of that was of course the vendors

666
00:31:44,289 --> 00:31:50,080
just tried to blame us and say well it

667
00:31:47,409 --> 00:31:53,110
must be their software it must be you

668
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:56,230
know our equipment works it's not our

669
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:58,059
fault and so we then had to get into

670
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:00,000
these really ugly showdowns where we're

671
00:31:58,059 --> 00:32:03,370
like no we're now going to prove that

672
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,169
what you're saying is rubbish and so

673
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:06,549
they would bring in their poor developer

674
00:32:05,169 --> 00:32:08,500
who would sit there when we would have

675
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:11,289
to humiliate the guy and say look this

676
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:14,409
is what he did wrong and so yeah I

677
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:21,549
thought that wasn't pleasant but that's

678
00:32:14,409 --> 00:32:24,510
the way they played the game then the

679
00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:24,510
Internet's came along

680
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:32,680
so we published this bit of software

681
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:36,770
called Apache SSL which was the first

682
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:39,340
secure web server software and at the

683
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:42,290
time again kind of hard to believe but

684
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:44,209
it was considered strong crypto was

685
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:47,270
considered a munition of war

686
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:50,750
so basically taking strong cryptography

687
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:53,450
oh by the US anyway taking strong

688
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:56,690
cryptography across the border in or out

689
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:59,690
of the US was like taking a nuclear

690
00:32:56,690 --> 00:33:01,190
weapon across the border and I don't

691
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:03,020
know if any of you remember that do you

692
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:06,590
remember the t-shirts that say it's just

693
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:08,690
an algorithm yeah so we used to wear

694
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:11,149
shirts with the algorithm on it and

695
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:12,800
cross the border as a joke going he'd

696
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:15,250
look at me I'm taking ammunition of war

697
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:22,550
across the --at walk across the border

698
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:25,520
but it was a serious thing they they

699
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:29,870
didn't want strong crypto to be exported

700
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:32,480
out of the US which is why Apache didn't

701
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:33,129
have strong crypto in it in the first

702
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,660
place

703
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:40,250
because they weren't allowed to so they

704
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:41,990
published Apache with modules so you

705
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:45,560
could plug in a module so we wrote the

706
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:48,260
SSL module for Apache and then we went

707
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:50,810
to the British government and we said so

708
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:54,890
what's the deal I mean if the US don't

709
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:57,560
allow it to be exported from there is

710
00:33:54,890 --> 00:34:02,690
there a problem with us exporting it to

711
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:04,220
them or generally and I think it was the

712
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:07,610
Department of Trade and Industry and

713
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:10,130
they said well we don't know we can't

714
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:12,889
give you a definite answer on that but

715
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:16,810
for now it's fine just keep track of

716
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:20,060
everyone who downloads it well I really

717
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:23,810
how do you do that and what happens if

718
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:27,500
you suddenly decide it is bad so luckily

719
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:29,779
for us I mean we did start distributing

720
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:32,000
it ourselves we just set up an FTP

721
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:34,250
server and we're like well you know

722
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,949
we'll keep the logs we can tell you what

723
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:37,590
IP downloaded it and that they logged in

724
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:42,969
as if

725
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:44,310
password anonymous but I can't tell you

726
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:47,319
who they are

727
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:50,139
so anyway oxfords I think Cambridge

728
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:52,139
University came along and said okay well

729
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:54,780
why don't we put it on our servers and

730
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:57,070
then if there's any problem with anyone

731
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,680
saying you're not allowed to export this

732
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:02,230
stuff then that'll be a good useful

733
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,899
training exercise for our law students

734
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:07,780
and we'll just give it to them and

735
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:10,510
they'll defend you and we're like cool

736
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:11,859
and then Oxford came along and said oh

737
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:13,600
okay well if Cambridge are doing that

738
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:15,850
we'll do that too so you can put it on

739
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:17,020
our servers too so in the end we had

740
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:19,029
Oxford University and Cambridge

741
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:21,550
University doing the distribution for us

742
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:23,830
and the nice cozy umbrella of their

743
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:25,330
legal departments saying they would

744
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:28,810
defend us in the case it all went

745
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:30,340
horribly wrong which was lovely and we

746
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:32,650
got squillions of downloads and it

747
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:36,910
became huge and we had 70% of the world

748
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:39,310
market for secure web servers and again

749
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:43,710
you know Microsoft and the rest of the

750
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:45,670
world had the share of 30% actually

751
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:47,170
again I don't know how many of you

752
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:50,109
remember but Microsoft were actually

753
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:54,040
quite late to enter the internet market

754
00:35:50,109 --> 00:35:55,869
they believed that their network so ms

755
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,850
net or something was going to be the

756
00:35:55,869 --> 00:36:02,500
thing and the internet was just a

757
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:08,529
passing fad they refused to even put tcp

758
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:11,140
into the windows stack for years so you

759
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:13,570
know it was kind of weird to see that

760
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:16,270
with Windows you had to buy plugins to

761
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:17,830
actually connect to the internet anyway

762
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:19,540
we did all that and it was huge and we

763
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:22,359
were you know shipping squillions of

764
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:24,700
copies but it was open source and it was

765
00:36:22,359 --> 00:36:28,450
free so yeah we didn't become

766
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:30,310
millionaires overnight sadly but what we

767
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:35,980
did do is get a lot of interesting work

768
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:42,190
from it so the first bank to go online

769
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:45,730
came to us and they were Scottish bank

770
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:49,090
and that picture that lady on the left

771
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:50,950
is Amanda lamb who was there the face of

772
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:52,809
the the bank

773
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:55,598
and she was this very modest you know

774
00:36:52,809 --> 00:36:57,609
wearing a shawl it was it was called

775
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,470
Scottish Widows so she was like the

776
00:36:57,609 --> 00:37:02,740
Scottish Widow and it was all very

777
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:05,200
modest she was on lots of TV ads and she

778
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:07,149
was very famous for doing it and then

779
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:10,000
for some reason she decided to do a

780
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:12,010
bikini shot don't know why I mean it

781
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,530
wasn't porn it wasn't she wasn't naked

782
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:16,690
but it was a bikini shot and then she

783
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:18,430
got in a lot of trouble for it and I

784
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:21,430
think she actually got sacked so they

785
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:26,140
didn't use her anymore but at the time

786
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:28,808
we had a continuous paper printer and we

787
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:31,808
managed to get a high-resolution picture

788
00:37:28,809 --> 00:37:34,299
of it and so I printed a full-size

789
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:36,280
picture of her in the bikini and I took

790
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:38,680
it to the Scottish Widows headquarters

791
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:40,150
and in their main server room on the

792
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:43,328
back of the door was this full-size

793
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:44,890
picture of Amanda and we always used to

794
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:46,900
say you know we're going to Amanda's if

795
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:49,480
we had to go to the the data center home

796
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:51,430
we just thought it was funny that none

797
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:53,290
of the bosses who'd sacked her knew that

798
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:55,990
they had the bikini shot in their server

799
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:57,880
room downstairs I don't have that

800
00:37:55,990 --> 00:38:02,140
picture anymore but when I was trying to

801
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:06,309
find it for this slide just don't search

802
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:12,640
for silver bikini on the internet some

803
00:38:06,309 --> 00:38:14,440
things can't be unseen okay and the

804
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,839
other one we did that was really

805
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:22,780
interesting was the first telco to go

806
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:25,058
online so one of the really big networks

807
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:27,970
in the UK decided to have a look at this

808
00:38:25,059 --> 00:38:31,990
funny internet thingy and they started a

809
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:33,609
project and what happened was really

810
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:35,439
surprising to everyone I think in a

811
00:38:33,609 --> 00:38:38,950
period of two years when we worked on

812
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:41,770
the project the guy who had basically

813
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:43,180
had to be strong-armed into doing it

814
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:43,859
because everyone thought it was a dead

815
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:47,980
end

816
00:38:43,859 --> 00:38:51,009
and like he thought he was committing

817
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:52,950
you know business suicide by going into

818
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:57,280
this department who was going to do this

819
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:58,990
silly little internet project it became

820
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:01,900
more important than any other business

821
00:38:58,990 --> 00:39:04,709
that phone company was doing and he

822
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:08,080
ended up as the

823
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:10,990
the head of the company so he ended up

824
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:13,120
taking over the entire telco so that was

825
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:14,729
really interesting and that happened

826
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:20,200
over two years you know he went from

827
00:39:14,730 --> 00:39:24,250
just being a management guy to being the

828
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:28,660
boss so that's how important the

829
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:29,980
internet had become who knew and then

830
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:34,930
because we were getting all of these

831
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:37,030
jobs and we were being asked well now

832
00:39:34,930 --> 00:39:39,750
you've created this and and security had

833
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:42,610
always been a thing for us because you

834
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:44,320
know we'd seen it all grow from the from

835
00:39:42,610 --> 00:39:46,270
the ground up so we were used to having

836
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:48,820
to look under the hood at everything we

837
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:51,190
were working with and so we had always

838
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:53,320
focused on security and that's why

839
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:56,190
people like banks and telcos talk to us

840
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:59,440
because you know we could do it properly

841
00:39:56,190 --> 00:40:01,060
so we started looking at when we're

842
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,370
looking at other customers who didn't

843
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:05,920
have their own mainframe server rooms

844
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:10,089
already and data centers of their own

845
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:11,650
we're like well where can we put our

846
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:14,490
projects when we do a project for

847
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:16,690
someone where can we put the servers

848
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:18,549
because if I just go and put it in a

849
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:25,030
shared hosting facility that's not going

850
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:28,660
to be very secure so we bought an

851
00:40:25,030 --> 00:40:31,270
underground nuclear bunker which had

852
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:32,649
just been refurbished by the RAF it used

853
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:35,410
to be the radar command and control

854
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:39,310
center part of the UK national defenses

855
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:42,250
and they decided it was surplus to

856
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:43,870
requirements and they sold it off but

857
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:48,970
because it was secret no-one knew they

858
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:52,569
were selling it off but I knew so I got

859
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:54,910
it really cheap so we we got this bunker

860
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:58,030
for super cheap and we set up a business

861
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:59,859
in there and we like wow this is so cool

862
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:04,750
we've got our own secret underground

863
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:07,660
lair so what we can do is we can be

864
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:10,810
really proactive and we can monitor

865
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:13,240
threats and we'll test them all and make

866
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:16,690
sure that you know each threat actually

867
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:18,040
works and that we're defended against it

868
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:21,790
and so on

869
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:24,910
and so we did and we you know we started

870
00:41:21,790 --> 00:41:27,460
doing secure hosting how much time have

871
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:33,640
I got left by the way five minutes while

872
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:37,180
I do ramble on sorry but yeah that

873
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:39,160
didn't seem to stop him I was amazed at

874
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:42,069
how much I mean again now this is all

875
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:44,970
common knowledge but we were just amazed

876
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:47,440
how fast if you put a server online

877
00:41:44,970 --> 00:41:52,509
within seconds we would be under attack

878
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:56,080
it was just incredible so we we found

879
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:58,950
out blue teaming is hard you have to get

880
00:41:56,080 --> 00:42:01,270
it right a hundred percent over the time

881
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:05,799
but the attacker only has to get it

882
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:09,780
right once obviously so so I'm like hmm

883
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:14,320
I know I'll change sides

884
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:18,940
so I'm going to go on the attack so red

885
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:20,320
teaming for me so but what am I going to

886
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:22,590
do I was kind of bored with networking

887
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:25,900
stuff you know I've been doing it for

888
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:32,170
over ten years and it was getting a bit

889
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:35,920
dull so I decided hardware was the way

890
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:38,080
to go it's the new frontier so basically

891
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:41,530
a lot of stuff over the years has been

892
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:45,220
tucked away in hardware it hides a lot

893
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:47,260
of sins embedded systems you know they

894
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:48,819
tend to be kind of modular so different

895
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:52,810
people make the different bits and they

896
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:55,330
all plug together to do something and so

897
00:42:52,810 --> 00:42:57,520
there's a lot of issues potentially with

898
00:42:55,330 --> 00:43:00,029
where those things join together and

899
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:02,770
where the modules talk to each other

900
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:05,590
they're very often made by third parties

901
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:07,090
who then don't maintain them anymore you

902
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:09,670
know once you've built an embedded

903
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:12,400
system it's very unusual that you will

904
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:15,070
then go back and start updating the

905
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:18,070
individual components within it so you

906
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:19,540
can end up with stuff out there in the

907
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:22,330
millions that's never going to get

908
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:25,630
updated there's got lots of problems and

909
00:43:22,330 --> 00:43:27,490
all you have to do is find them and when

910
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:29,020
you find a problem in a module you'll

911
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:30,879
find that module in a bunch of other

912
00:43:29,020 --> 00:43:34,330
things as well

913
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,830
so it was really rich pickings and

914
00:43:34,330 --> 00:43:37,420
people sell them and move on and do

915
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:39,370
something else and they won't label it

916
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:43,270
and that keeps getting sold and sold and

917
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:47,890
sold so some of the interesting things

918
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:51,430
we found three chips within a single

919
00:43:47,890 --> 00:43:53,140
chip so I don't know if you can properly

920
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:56,080
see it here but if you look there's a

921
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:57,549
little chip on the right and then

922
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:59,440
there's another big chip in the middle

923
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:02,650
and then there's another little chip on

924
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:05,890
the left and on the outside this just

925
00:44:02,650 --> 00:44:08,680
looks like a single chip so it's only

926
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:11,560
when you x-ray it that you find actually

927
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:14,740
there's three chips in there one of them

928
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:18,100
was an EEPROM one of them was an MCU and

929
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:21,520
one of them was an RF transmitter so mmm

930
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:28,210
what's that doing so that was

931
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:30,280
interesting we built some equipment for

932
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:33,880
drilling down into the chips using

933
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:36,040
fuming nitric acid so we could very

934
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:37,630
accurately drill a little hole I mean

935
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:40,509
this pictures actually from something

936
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:42,670
that's bendy capped but we could also

937
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:45,520
just drill little holes and expose the

938
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:48,460
bond wires so you can then tap in and

939
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:51,520
watch the conversation so on that

940
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:53,560
particular that the three chip chip we

941
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:56,560
drilled down to the wires between the

942
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:59,770
EEPROM and the MCU and then we were able

943
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:03,520
to watch the conversation going on

944
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:05,740
between the EEPROM and the MCU so the

945
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:08,200
data that the manufacturer thought they

946
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:10,390
had kept entirely secret there were no

947
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:14,589
pins on the outside of this chip that

948
00:45:10,390 --> 00:45:17,350
gave you access to the EEPROM but there

949
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:20,290
were obviously pins inside that gave the

950
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:22,150
MCU access to the EEPROM and so the

951
00:45:20,290 --> 00:45:24,460
hardware guys thought well it's hidden

952
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:25,810
in the block of silicon you can't get to

953
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:28,600
that because we don't need to do

954
00:45:25,810 --> 00:45:32,290
anything secure here so all the data

955
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:35,500
going between the EEPROM and the MCU was

956
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:38,740
in plain text non-obvious gated so we

957
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:41,370
were able to extract secret keys from

958
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:41,370
any prom

959
00:45:41,390 --> 00:45:51,770
we then dissolved the whole chip in acid

960
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:54,590
cleaned it up a bit and that's the

961
00:45:51,770 --> 00:45:59,990
masked ROM so in the massed Rob you can

962
00:45:54,590 --> 00:46:02,510
actually see the code so basically a doc

963
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:05,390
or an absence of a dot is a bit so it's

964
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:07,430
either a 1 or a nought so you can

965
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:10,400
actually just take that turn it back

966
00:46:07,430 --> 00:46:12,850
into a binary disassemble that and

967
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,290
you've now got the source code or

968
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:17,029
decompile it after you disassemble it

969
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:20,000
and you've now got the source code for

970
00:46:17,030 --> 00:46:22,340
the device you're looking at so that was

971
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:25,670
pretty awesome we managed to completely

972
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:28,340
reverse that entire system and again not

973
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:30,050
particularly uncommon these days it's a

974
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:40,820
lot of old hardware out there that's

975
00:46:30,050 --> 00:46:42,650
behaving in the same way so finally as I

976
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:45,050
say I just kind of rambling on about how

977
00:46:42,650 --> 00:46:49,640
I got here I didn't expect to get here I

978
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:54,980
left school at 14 with no education at

979
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:56,060
all there's a joke in our industry that

980
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:59,090
if you are a criminal

981
00:46:56,060 --> 00:47:03,170
you'd be a lot better off because it's

982
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:05,870
too easy I mean seriously if we were

983
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:07,480
doing this as criminals we would all be

984
00:47:05,870 --> 00:47:13,970
rich and lying on a beach somewhere

985
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:16,130
awake I am at a beach somewhere so yeah

986
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:17,750
I mean I just wanted to say you know I

987
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:19,460
meet a lot of people in this industry

988
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:21,590
who didn't know they were going to get

989
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:23,180
into doing what they're doing they just

990
00:47:21,590 --> 00:47:27,220
kind of stumbled into it which is what

991
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:29,060
happened to me but yeah keep on hacking

992
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:32,138
thank you

993
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:32,139
[Music]

994
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:46,230
do we have time for any questions any

995
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:46,230
questions got one over here

996
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,070
[Music]

997
00:47:58,349 --> 00:48:02,060
thanks Adam for the

998
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:05,779
presentation will hook question

999
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:08,290
regarding the these silicon chips how

1000
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:11,230
applicable are those today

1001
00:48:08,290 --> 00:48:13,430
how common of the chips today the the

1002
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:18,230
technique that you did to drill down to

1003
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:20,149
the silicon chips and made them it's

1004
00:48:18,230 --> 00:48:23,450
still very effective I mean going

1005
00:48:20,150 --> 00:48:25,040
tapping onto bond wires applies to

1006
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:28,069
pretty much any chip that's out there

1007
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:30,680
now the equipment to do it is quite

1008
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:33,110
expensive if you buy it I mean I think

1009
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:34,580
you can pay you can buy a machine that

1010
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:38,060
will do that cut and drilling for about

1011
00:48:34,580 --> 00:48:42,110
twenty grand we built one for a couple

1012
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:43,880
of hundred pounds you know my hardware

1013
00:48:42,110 --> 00:48:47,090
partners act is very good at that kind

1014
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:50,750
of stuff and he invented his own machine

1015
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:52,190
we called the Decapitator I wouldn't go

1016
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:55,310
near it personally because it's

1017
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:58,670
dangerous it's fuming nitric acid will

1018
00:48:55,310 --> 00:49:00,380
kill you so you have to be careful but

1019
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:02,270
it can't be done yeah

1020
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:07,520
and I think it's very relevant still yes

1021
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:09,410
thanks anything else

1022
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:12,040
no I think everyone's leaving anyway but

1023
00:49:09,410 --> 00:49:16,638
thanks again Cheers

1024
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:16,639
