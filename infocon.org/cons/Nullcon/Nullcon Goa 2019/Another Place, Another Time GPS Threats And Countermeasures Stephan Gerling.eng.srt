1
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:07,519
start already um so my talking today

2
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:11,480
about GPS threats and countermeasures

3
00:00:07,519 --> 00:00:14,360
and my name did another place another

4
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:18,109
time because we can manipulate the

5
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:21,500
signal from from GPS and Alta was the

6
00:00:18,109 --> 00:00:23,660
data for example how it is done and some

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:28,220
technical background I will show yours

8
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:31,670
and in in the presentation it's more

9
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:34,070
focused on yachts because my previous

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:36,319
things that I did we're talking about

11
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:45,559
yacht security and hacking stuff in

12
00:00:36,319 --> 00:00:49,549
yachts so why it is not working ah now

13
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:51,620
it's better yeah so the outline for

14
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:54,399
today it's we have a short introduction

15
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:57,589
about me then

16
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,260
GPS 101 so that we have a knowledge

17
00:00:57,589 --> 00:01:01,998
about how GPS is working what kind of

18
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:06,259
systems are there and how many different

19
00:01:01,999 --> 00:01:08,950
GPS systems are now available then we

20
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:13,190
take a little thought overview into

21
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:15,140
yacht systems and GPS there and then we

22
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:18,679
focus on the threats and countermeasures

23
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:20,930
in that so and at the end then we have a

24
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,240
little bit of time for some questions if

25
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:29,840
you have or otherwise we can also

26
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:32,539
discuss on the outside yeah GPS everyone

27
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:40,190
is using it but mostly nobody knows how

28
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:41,360
we're just working and yeah so there are

29
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:47,110
many names for that

30
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:51,050
GPS NASA Galileo GLONASS Baidu and IRNSS

31
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:54,159
so these are all different versions or

32
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:57,979
GPS systems that you can have now and

33
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,650
yeah so many names but mostly all using

34
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:02,929
the same thing so the thing that you are

35
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:05,450
using was that is

36
00:02:02,929 --> 00:02:07,729
it gives you a positioning information

37
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:12,530
about where you are and what time it is

38
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:14,569
and yeah so all together they are named

39
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:19,040
as a global navigation satellite system

40
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:24,220
or in short a GNSS so that's the general

41
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:27,349
term for the GPS systems yeah Who am I

42
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:29,690
as already named Stefan yelling or on

43
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:33,440
Twitter you can find me an OB one six

44
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:37,459
six six I'm older than the Internet so

45
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,500
it started with a Commodore 64 yeah some

46
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:42,170
certifications I have like in forensic

47
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:46,910
analyst or cissp microsoft certified

48
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:50,000
systems engineer' CCNA and whatever I'm

49
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:52,579
an electronics specialist worked several

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,349
years in a German army and was

51
00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:56,180
responsible for maintaining and

52
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:59,899
repairing navigation systems for

53
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:02,540
helicopters and in my free time I'm also

54
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:04,760
a firefighter since more than 31 years

55
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:08,120
now so that's one of my biggest passion

56
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:11,328
and yeah I'm working in the oil and gas

57
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:14,319
industry for my company Rosen and also

58
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:17,450
for a spin-off of that called salvation

59
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:20,480
by the way I avoid Varon teas I buy

60
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:22,670
stuff open it and look what how it is

61
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,030
working and I'm volunteering in the

62
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:29,929
Gothel group it's an it's a part of the

63
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:33,739
CCC camp or the CCC group and yeah and

64
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:36,410
also in I'm the cavalry there I'm in the

65
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:40,519
maritime sector and doing their security

66
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:44,660
stuff and maritime systems I think we

67
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:47,750
also May this year in DEFCON village

68
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:51,918
about maritime security so we will see

69
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:55,069
if it is accepted or not yeah has

70
00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:56,780
already heard so many systems so GNSS is

71
00:03:55,069 --> 00:04:01,638
the global term for global navigation

72
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:05,000
satellite systems and we're the

73
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:07,230
abbreviation came from and the original

74
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,500
one is so the first one

75
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:12,359
we had in place was enough star GPS so

76
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,450
it was from the United States of America

77
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,310
they introduced the system in 1973 or

78
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:20,579
they built up the development of or

79
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,530
death and so NASA is then for

80
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,550
navigational satellite timing and

81
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:28,859
ranging Global Positioning System and

82
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:31,919
the short-term GPS it's commonly used by

83
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:35,940
everyone when we talking about

84
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:38,700
yeah positioning systems so that was the

85
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:39,750
first one then the Russians introduced

86
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,110
their own systems

87
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:47,190
they called it GLONASS and GLONASS is

88
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:50,520
from global Yana navigation ah Sputnik

89
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:53,400
over sistema so it's the Russian

90
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,680
worrying about how they named it and the

91
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,070
short version is then GLONASS when you

92
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:03,570
put the names around then we have an

93
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:06,169
European version they introduced it a

94
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:09,300
little bit later because they want to

95
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:12,630
not respond on the military services

96
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:15,389
from from the GPS from the US so

97
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:18,960
formally the GPS system was introduced

98
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:23,880
by military services that it is an

99
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:28,560
military Positioning System and in most

100
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:32,460
of the wars since 1990s where GPS is

101
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:37,919
used by also aircrafts and maritime

102
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:41,239
sector the military always shut down the

103
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:45,570
system in in conflict for example so and

104
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:47,460
they still do it so therefore Galilei

105
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:50,940
wasn't also introduced so it's an

106
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:53,460
completely free system from the European

107
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:55,380
Union and it's a free for everyone to

108
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:58,049
use it so you have only to follow the

109
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:02,580
guidelines and then you can use it for

110
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:06,840
that and yeah China also has its own one

111
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:09,750
they called it Baidu and the name from

112
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,239
the Chinese version it's from an Big

113
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:16,020
Dipper asterism system in

114
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:18,720
in the air so in the Chinese this

115
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:21,389
asteroid system is called Baidu

116
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:25,199
and the Chinese word you can also see

117
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:29,370
there and last but not least we have

118
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:32,610
also an Indian version about that so all

119
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:35,070
other systems are global and the Indian

120
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:39,770
one is only a local system so it's only

121
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:44,759
coverage over India and and at least

122
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:47,219
1500 to 2000 kilometers in in range so

123
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:50,400
that it covers complete Indian and

124
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:54,660
that's it so they have seven satellites

125
00:06:50,400 --> 00:07:00,239
for that to cover India atmosphere food

126
00:06:54,660 --> 00:07:02,539
or the services yeah it was introduced

127
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,500
as Indian regional navigation satellite

128
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:10,680
system and after it comes operational in

129
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:12,800
2016 it was then renamed by the Prime

130
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,449
Minister in navigation Indian

131
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,949
constellation and it's in short it's a

132
00:07:15,449 --> 00:07:24,470
NEVEC so that are the names for that

133
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:26,820
okay so we have so many things of that

134
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:30,599
most of all the normal systems are

135
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:35,010
relying on global positioning systems so

136
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:38,039
that they know where they are and as we

137
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:40,590
learn later you can find out that you

138
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:44,270
can alter the position where you are so

139
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:50,669
that's not that big thing biggest deal

140
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:54,330
so it's called GPS and oh I think it was

141
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:56,729
an erroneous slide okay here on short

142
00:07:54,330 --> 00:08:00,990
overview about the history of the

143
00:07:56,729 --> 00:08:04,650
systems so the first one started an in

144
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:08,909
development in 1973 with a GPS from NASA

145
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:13,460
and the first satellite we're in the air

146
00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:16,710
1978 and it was fully operational 1990

147
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:20,489
no you can use it in 1990 already but a

148
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:22,109
fully operational is one 1995 the

149
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:24,300
Russian version started a little bit

150
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:26,879
later so three years later

151
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:29,960
and they had the first satellites of

152
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:32,219
four years later in the air and we are

153
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,799
nearly at the same time a fully

154
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:40,469
operational like the Russians

155
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:43,319
um the Chinese started in 1980 and it

156
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:46,160
took more or less than 20 years to get

157
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:49,040
their first satellites in the air and

158
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:54,439
but after then they were already

159
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:57,149
operational since 2012 and since yeah

160
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,550
next year they have the last satellite

161
00:08:57,149 --> 00:09:00,959
so end of the year there will fire up

162
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:03,029
the last satellite for them and then

163
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:07,199
it's a global operational for the

164
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:10,470
Chinese yeah the German word or the

165
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:15,839
European version I must say they started

166
00:09:10,470 --> 00:09:17,370
in 1999 other sources saying they

167
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,209
started in 2003

168
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:24,209
so it was depending on which sources you

169
00:09:21,209 --> 00:09:28,170
taking and the first satellites they

170
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:32,880
shoot in year was 2005 mostly the

171
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:38,300
Russians fired from their rocket areas

172
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:42,180
in the air and it was operational and in

173
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:45,029
2016 and should be fully operative also

174
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:47,640
next year so there are currently 24

175
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:51,600
satellites in the air but they need up

176
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:54,029
to have 30 satellites for that so 24

177
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,740
satellites are used for the positioning

178
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:59,760
system and there have expressed

179
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:02,820
satellites for that and latest one is

180
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:06,450
the Indian version so the development

181
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:08,970
started in 2004 it's not that far away

182
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:12,870
and the first satellites were then in

183
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:16,110
2013 in the air and it was the first

184
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:20,540
month and then in 2016 they had all

185
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:22,430
seven satellites up in the sky so

186
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:25,310
yeah that it's only a fraud overview

187
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:29,949
about the history of when the systems

188
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:32,599
were there what you need for that is

189
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:36,350
okay each satellite is sending a signal

190
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:39,200
so here we have an overview about which

191
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:41,240
kind of frequencies they are using and

192
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:50,990
in which kind of bands they are working

193
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:54,320
so mostly the public versions are in the

194
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:58,550
l1 band so the GPS is working their

195
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:04,160
GLONASS is working their Galileo compass

196
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:08,479
it's the former name of Baidu and also

197
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:12,290
the SP is it's an special of a retinal

198
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,930
system but yeah mostly they're using in

199
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:19,069
a right sector than l1 band so the l2

200
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:21,079
band it's an it's a more encrypted

201
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:24,200
signal and it's only available for

202
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:26,570
military services so they havin another

203
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,490
frequencies that are using and they're

204
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:32,690
using some kind of encryption for

205
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:34,970
securing V and making the data more

206
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:37,190
reliable so that nobody can alter the

207
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:40,670
information about what is transmitted

208
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:43,520
and and the l5 band is then also used

209
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:48,740
for some backup reasons um and also some

210
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:51,560
test frequencies um yeah so to heaven

211
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:53,990
broader overview um I have write down

212
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,540
all the frequencies used by which system

213
00:11:53,990 --> 00:12:01,130
and there you can see already we have 1

214
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:03,589
2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 11 or 12

215
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:06,010
frequencies that the GPS systems are

216
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:08,780
using so when you now thinking about

217
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:11,930
jamming or spoofing then there is a

218
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:16,819
broad range that you have to otherwise

219
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:21,560
the signals just as an overview how'd it

220
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:25,790
look like in the air now so this is by

221
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:29,150
the way a satellite from Galileo that's

222
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:32,360
in the how it looks like in the orbit

223
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:33,630
the sending power of one of those

224
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:36,390
satellites the

225
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:40,320
on the system using so some of them I

226
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:44,060
sending with 600 watt energy some of

227
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:48,960
them now also up to 1500 watts of

228
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:52,319
descending energy and in the right

229
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:57,930
picture you see how far all the systems

230
00:12:52,320 --> 00:13:01,110
are away from the earth so it's quite

231
00:12:57,930 --> 00:13:03,959
busy on the air there and each system

232
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:08,300
yeah GPS has 24 satellites GLONASS has

233
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:12,270
also around 24 Galileo has 30 satellites

234
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:15,380
seven for the Indian and and so on so

235
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:18,510
there are so many satellites in the air

236
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:23,420
for so many systems and they are all in

237
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:26,910
a range of a couple of kilometers yeah

238
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:31,459
that's for that so what we need for

239
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:34,020
positioning information so to have an

240
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:36,510
correct positional information you need

241
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:39,300
at least at minimum you need three

242
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:41,460
satellites in sight of view so there

243
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:45,660
must be three satellites over you yet

244
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:48,120
you can it may be look up but you can't

245
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:50,069
see it because it's too far away but

246
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:52,140
with those resettle lights you cannot

247
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:54,930
already have an positioning information

248
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:57,569
because every satellite is sending a

249
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:59,729
signal and your receiver than receiving

250
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:06,390
the signals may for example your iPhone

251
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:10,050
or your mobile phone okay and from how

252
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:15,360
they calculate the position from that is

253
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:18,689
that you you can say each satellite is

254
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,260
sending the information from the

255
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:22,910
satellite

256
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:26,370
okay this is a satellite one for example

257
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:29,990
my sending time is also transmitted so

258
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:32,580
the first signal that I sent is the time

259
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:35,670
when the signal was sended from the

260
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:39,290
satellite and yeah it's the first

261
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:43,589
information then the second one is that

262
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:48,980
the satellite type

263
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:51,180
and that's it so from that then you have

264
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:55,079
on the receiver then you have the

265
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:57,449
receiving time so in the first stage the

266
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:59,939
receiver has a different time for

267
00:14:57,449 --> 00:15:01,920
example because the time clock oven

268
00:14:59,939 --> 00:15:05,748
receivers not that accurate like an

269
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:08,998
atomic clock and a satellite so that is

270
00:15:05,749 --> 00:15:10,680
then calculated with the information

271
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:15,329
centered and with the first information

272
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:20,128
they get they are also changing the

273
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:21,839
clock internally and receiver so then

274
00:15:20,129 --> 00:15:23,759
you're receiving also the other

275
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,879
satellite informations and from the

276
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:28,829
three satellites in position you know

277
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:33,620
okay the satellites are in that position

278
00:15:28,829 --> 00:15:36,089
and I must be anywhere in that direction

279
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:39,389
because with the three satellites you

280
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:40,769
have an appointing information about

281
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:42,839
where all the satellite information

282
00:15:40,769 --> 00:15:46,620
crosses and that's the point where you

283
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:49,980
are on correct timing information you

284
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:52,259
need also a fourth satellite so with

285
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:54,860
four satellite insight you can have

286
00:15:52,259 --> 00:15:59,250
already a correct timing information and

287
00:15:54,860 --> 00:16:01,110
with those four informations then the

288
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:04,139
receiver calculate all the information

289
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:07,920
that necessary it's a little bit

290
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:14,879
difficult but just only for the overview

291
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:16,680
about that so security is also not

292
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:20,129
really implemented in most of the system

293
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:23,279
for the military services yes so they're

294
00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:25,500
using some kind of encryption and it's

295
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:28,730
not public available but for all other

296
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:33,709
systems there is a no really security

297
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:36,870
inside I set here for Galileo yes but

298
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:40,638
it's only for a special services like

299
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:45,779
search and rescue and so on they can use

300
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:48,179
the secured version of that signals yeah

301
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:51,740
as all they have done it spoofing and

302
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:51,740
jamming is possible for that

303
00:16:51,829 --> 00:17:01,939
a short overview about NASA already said

304
00:16:56,089 --> 00:17:08,329
they introduced in 1973 operational

305
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:13,599
since 1993 then they lost some no that's

306
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:19,188
that's Sara I'm sorry forget this slide

307
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:22,668
we switch this also okay yeah

308
00:17:19,189 --> 00:17:24,799
Galileo if you want to know if your

309
00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:27,110
mobile phone for example is using

310
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:31,279
already Galileo you can look up on the

311
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:33,049
website use Galileo dot EU and then you

312
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:36,309
can look up for example for the maritime

313
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:39,830
equipment for the road for trains for

314
00:17:36,309 --> 00:17:41,450
aircraft for mobile devices or IEP

315
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:44,360
devices and so on there's a complete

316
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:47,750
list of all receivers that are already

317
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:50,090
capable for doing that I know from

318
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:53,690
iPhones for example that since the

319
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:58,970
iPhone 6 they are having the capability

320
00:17:53,690 --> 00:18:01,760
to receive the Galileo information good

321
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:03,919
honest it's a little bit difficult but

322
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,408
it's ending on the same frequency but

323
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:13,190
there's another signal information about

324
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:19,120
that okay so that was the short overview

325
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:21,770
about a little bit how it is working so

326
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,600
this one is now a German picture about

327
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:28,570
because we're coming now to the maritime

328
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:33,139
sector there was some news about hecka

329
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:38,830
changing yachts gps signals so there was

330
00:18:33,139 --> 00:18:44,689
an University in Texas in Austin they

331
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:47,389
hit in 2012 an experiment on a 65 meter

332
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:50,870
yacht and had their equipment on board

333
00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:53,418
and they changed the position by three

334
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:55,610
degree of the ship on the course so the

335
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:58,909
ship then changed the course or for

336
00:18:55,610 --> 00:19:01,100
three degrees and but the navigation

337
00:18:58,909 --> 00:19:02,640
system say ok the system is on the same

338
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:06,449
track

339
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,730
but the GPS is completely altered so on

340
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:10,410
the chart display you had the

341
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:13,320
information you are on the right track

342
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:16,200
but in real life you were a couple of

343
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:19,379
hundred meters away from that track very

344
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:23,990
aware aware the thing how they did it

345
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:26,460
was they had their equipment onboard and

346
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:30,150
overriding the GPS signal coming from

347
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:36,419
the air because they had some tools to

348
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:38,299
use that and they slightly powering up

349
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:40,260
their signal so that they override

350
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:43,260
original signal from the satellites

351
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:45,510
because the receiving strength of the

352
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:48,150
signal of the satellites is very low so

353
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:51,750
when you didn't have an transmitter of

354
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:56,820
in a near fight that it has more power

355
00:19:51,750 --> 00:20:01,230
than the signal is then used so yeah so

356
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:03,870
they proved that it is possible but the

357
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:09,990
thing that what not mentioned wasn't

358
00:20:03,870 --> 00:20:12,120
that see in that talk was they they

359
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:15,480
needed the equipment on board and they

360
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:19,199
had to slightly step-by-step change the

361
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:23,640
position when you just give a new

362
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:25,679
position to the maritime ships then some

363
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,450
kind of some receivers will detected

364
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,790
that there is an jump in the course and

365
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:32,190
then will ignore or they will show up

366
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:35,399
with an information about that even

367
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:36,750
though GPS receiver heaven when you have

368
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,049
the four satellites in sight they have

369
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:41,250
an LOC indicator that you have an

370
00:20:39,049 --> 00:20:47,850
correct signal and that the receiver is

371
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:50,940
locked yeah it was

372
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:54,179
about that and okay I would just look

373
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:57,780
like in yachts so here we have a big

374
00:20:54,180 --> 00:21:03,090
overview about the complete maritime GPS

375
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:06,120
and navigation stuff and I'm not sure is

376
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:09,480
it really viewable so when we look here

377
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:11,429
the yellow part the yellow we are

378
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:14,720
aligned it's for the outer pilot system

379
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:20,700
and under the yellow part arisen small

380
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:23,910
yty stats the GPS antenna so and in the

381
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:26,640
maritime sector the GPS systems are

382
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:30,570
sending the signals onto the enemy abuzz

383
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:33,480
so it's an serial bus in the past and in

384
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:36,270
the and nowadays or no on newer ships

385
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:40,830
you have also in canvas like that and

386
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:43,410
yeah the receiver is receiving the the

387
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:44,909
positioning information from the sky and

388
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:48,090
the sending them the positioning

389
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:51,270
information on the canvas and all other

390
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:53,760
systems are using those informations so

391
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:56,100
the University showed that you can alter

392
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,790
with the GPS signal but there are other

393
00:21:56,100 --> 00:22:03,270
ways for dudette um as already mentioned

394
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:06,840
here so the GPS sensor is receiving the

395
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:10,020
information and send it on the enemy or

396
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:12,120
bus and then all other services that

397
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:14,400
using the positioning information are

398
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:17,149
then for example the AIS so the

399
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:20,130
automatic identification system and

400
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:22,650
vessel traffic services and electronic

401
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:25,590
chart display also using those

402
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:29,820
informations so when you're now able to

403
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:31,709
change those information then you have

404
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:36,570
completely incomplete different

405
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:40,560
different a view about of that so why is

406
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:42,780
this important is because of more more

407
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:47,820
from these autonomous ships are coming

408
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:50,550
now the 2017 rolls-royce had done an

409
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:55,350
experiment with in fully automatic ship

410
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:58,020
so they they laying at the Harbor day

411
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:59,159
going on on their way and coming back

412
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:02,310
later then

413
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:04,170
and so everything is then also

414
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:06,419
controlled over the year there was an

415
00:23:04,170 --> 00:23:09,210
air controller that is using that but

416
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:13,490
also the positioning information where

417
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:18,810
all the time from the GPS systems so

418
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:22,260
that's that so 2017 is was the focus

419
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:27,110
from rolls-royce and it was an 28 meter

420
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:31,220
long Chuck called the Switzer Hammond

421
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:33,719
yes they did it in Copenhagen Harbor and

422
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:36,810
the captain for the ship was not on the

423
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:39,240
ship itself the operator was somewhere

424
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:42,200
else yeah

425
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:47,150
and they did it completely automatic and

426
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:47,150
for that also the GPS estimates use

427
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:54,719
we're coming now to the funnier part of

428
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,640
that so what kind of attacks we have and

429
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:02,010
what kind of countermeasures we can have

430
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:05,130
so okay there are only two things that

431
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:07,740
you can make so you can jam the signal

432
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:10,800
or you can spoof to signal that aren't

433
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:13,590
the only two attacks for the GPS itself

434
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,540
in the maritime section then you have

435
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:20,030
also the the combustor where you can

436
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:23,550
alter the information so two scenarios

437
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:27,300
jamming and spoofing jamming is quite

438
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:30,510
simple just fire up in some kind of an

439
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:36,030
transmitting device like an HEC RF or

440
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:37,740
whatever so I have some here so with an

441
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:41,370
HEC RF and the right antenna you can do

442
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:45,270
already your stuff or when you use a

443
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:49,979
blade RF within a GPS antenna you can

444
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:52,020
also do the jamming things and these

445
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:54,330
devices are can also be used for the

446
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:58,110
spoofing so spoofing is a little bit

447
00:24:54,330 --> 00:25:00,210
more complicated but it's also possible

448
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:03,120
for less than zero zero you have already

449
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:05,900
equipment in place that you can use

450
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:13,379
and away you can gamble with the signals

451
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:16,880
um yeah German is quite common so in the

452
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:20,940
past in the eastern Pacific there were

453
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:24,000
reports anomalies mostly varying

454
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:26,550
maneuvers from the Russian side or when

455
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:30,210
the NATO troops made their own military

456
00:25:26,550 --> 00:25:33,720
maneuvers so during that times they

457
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:37,980
mostly jammed a GPS signal in that area

458
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:40,320
or slightly reducing the accuracy of the

459
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:43,290
signal so that there is an different

460
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:46,379
positioning range in that area so

461
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:49,770
normally you are let's say around three

462
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:51,000
meters in accuracy and they can change

463
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:55,590
it up to a hundred meter or two hundred

464
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:58,470
meter or even more so that's what done

465
00:25:55,590 --> 00:26:00,928
done was the GPS system in that era and

466
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:01,770
there's also a new report about that I

467
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:07,140
have it here

468
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:10,620
also as an link where where they figured

469
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:13,590
out in Norway in planes that their GPS

470
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:15,979
signal was altered and then they started

471
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:18,899
up with an helicopter with an

472
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:21,300
directional antenna and then they could

473
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:24,179
then figure out okay the direction of

474
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:27,389
the jamming signal was more or less from

475
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:30,630
the far east area so it might be Russia

476
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:31,890
or somewhere else in that area so it's

477
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:34,530
not really clear where it was coming

478
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:41,900
from but it was more or less on from the

479
00:26:34,530 --> 00:26:46,500
Russian area yeah and for all that stuff

480
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:50,190
in past the US Navy we're relying on

481
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:52,920
only GPS navigation and they start where

482
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:54,990
they stopped was teaching navigate a

483
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:58,679
traditional navigation with a 6/10 for

484
00:26:54,990 --> 00:27:01,559
example after they heard more and more

485
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:05,700
about attacking for the GPS system day

486
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:07,800
starting again teaching their captains

487
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,770
in six and navigation in classical

488
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,870
navigation for that so the first

489
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:15,120
trainings were by example and in Germany

490
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:18,030
so the US Marine then

491
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:21,959
by Germans in navigation again for that

492
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:25,139
old stuff so sometimes is very good when

493
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:31,440
you know how things work in traditional

494
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:34,470
ways okay for the GPS jamming the fact

495
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,830
we have already seen so we need a couple

496
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:41,040
of frequencies where we have to jam the

497
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:45,149
signal so if we only want to shut down

498
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:48,780
one GPS receiver then it's very easy but

499
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:53,340
to be sure that you shut down everyone

500
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:55,200
because most most airplanes or ships or

501
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,939
other devices have more than one early

502
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:00,600
GPS receiver

503
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:04,800
in the commercial navigation from ships

504
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:07,860
you need at least two different GPS

505
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:10,290
systems and then you can get rid of your

506
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:13,169
traditional sea charts then you have

507
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:16,290
only the electronic ones so for that you

508
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:18,450
need already to know what kind of GPS

509
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:20,460
system they are using to shut down both

510
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:26,130
systems that they have the faked

511
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:29,160
information yeah for example the GPS

512
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:33,450
most of the systems are working on those

513
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:37,470
thing on those frequencies here and for

514
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:39,990
that you can buy online GPS Gemma for

515
00:28:37,470 --> 00:28:43,860
that it's quite easy they are not so

516
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:46,890
cheap so there's a website for that just

517
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:51,750
go there and you can buy GPS Gemma you

518
00:28:46,890 --> 00:28:56,850
can cellphone Gemma and and so on so the

519
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:59,179
range is from I think $70 up to six

520
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:03,000
hundred seven hundred thousand and so on

521
00:28:59,179 --> 00:29:07,530
so I picked up a few of them so there is

522
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:10,110
a small USB GPS Gemma 79 bucks very

523
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:14,010
cheap you can also have a mini GPS Gemma

524
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:17,040
or anti tracking device when you take a

525
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:18,800
rental car or when you may be seeing

526
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:20,930
someone has

527
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,270
in police cases sometimes they putting

528
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:25,550
in GPS tracker on your car that the

529
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:28,879
police can know okay the victim is now

530
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:30,590
driving down there or that using low C

531
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,930
wise the GPS tracker is not working

532
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:36,230
anymore and there is also another one

533
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:40,130
you can just put into your cigarette

534
00:29:36,230 --> 00:29:42,650
lighter jacket and then it fires up was

535
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:48,410
everything and jamming the GPS signals

536
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:53,030
for that the strength of the signal is

537
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:54,590
not dead much but it's enough to to

538
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,930
generate a signal for your car for

539
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:59,810
example

540
00:29:55,930 --> 00:30:03,350
yeah then we come to the spoofing things

541
00:29:59,810 --> 00:30:07,460
so for that we need a little bit more so

542
00:30:03,350 --> 00:30:12,830
you can buy commercial tools for that so

543
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:17,690
they cool they called ya GNSS simulator

544
00:30:12,830 --> 00:30:22,280
and you can also buy them your one

545
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:25,210
example from website you can buy a range

546
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:27,740
of gns simulators for that that you can

547
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:32,600
test your development of your dns

548
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:35,690
receiver for example and so on so this

549
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:37,730
is one thing that you can buy but it

550
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:40,090
costs a lot of money I'm not sure how

551
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:42,950
much it is but they're quite expensive

552
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:47,659
so and it must be in cheaper way for

553
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:50,240
that and the cheaper way is we just make

554
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:54,230
it do it ourselves so what we need to

555
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:58,400
spoof a GPS signal first of all we need

556
00:30:54,230 --> 00:31:02,090
to write tools so you can start with an

557
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:06,050
HEC RF and a right antenna or the other

558
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:09,050
one that I use is a blade RF played RF

559
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:11,690
also with the right GPS antenna and with

560
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:15,720
that you can already try your own things

561
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:18,090
but a good advice

562
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:21,900
for that don't mess with the signals and

563
00:31:18,090 --> 00:31:25,408
don't uh don't deserve other ones with

564
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:28,530
that so it is always a good decision to

565
00:31:25,409 --> 00:31:31,789
have an a Faraday cage for that or I use

566
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:34,500
mostly some kind of these farad I know

567
00:31:31,789 --> 00:31:36,150
you can buy them as a forensic back so

568
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:38,100
it's completely shielded put your stuff

569
00:31:36,150 --> 00:31:39,690
in there and then you can test it and no

570
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:42,418
signal is going outside of this back

571
00:31:39,690 --> 00:31:44,070
it's also good for mobile phones you put

572
00:31:42,419 --> 00:31:51,030
the mobile phone in and nothing is going

573
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:54,750
out so just only as an advice so for the

574
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:57,000
DIY spoofing we need also some software

575
00:31:54,750 --> 00:32:00,990
so there are a couple of tools available

576
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,980
for that and the easiest one is just

577
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:05,880
download from github

578
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:08,280
the GPS SDR simulator software just

579
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:10,169
download it follow the instructions and

580
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:13,620
it's it's operable with most of the

581
00:32:10,169 --> 00:32:17,780
software-defined radio stuff um the URL

582
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:24,090
is also there or you can just google it

583
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:30,330
yeah then the complex part is then how

584
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:34,639
to fake the signal so every satellite

585
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:37,740
position is changing every day so

586
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:40,110
because of that there is also a daily

587
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:42,780
update file about the correct position

588
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:45,389
of each satellite in orbit you can

589
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:48,658
download those files for example on the

590
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:52,140
NASA website where you have the daily

591
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:55,710
GPS position of each satellite and with

592
00:32:52,140 --> 00:33:00,059
that information you can then generate

593
00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:04,260
your own soil range simulated file for

594
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:08,520
that so this basic file with a position

595
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:11,100
as needed and yeah the second thing that

596
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:14,280
you need is your own position that you

597
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:20,969
want to submit to the signature to the

598
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:23,330
victim so just taking some some yeah

599
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:25,789
latitude longitude information about

600
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:29,870
which kind of positions you want to fake

601
00:33:25,789 --> 00:33:32,400
put it in the CSCS our file and

602
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:35,010
yeah you have to put in for that you can

603
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:37,050
also make some tracks for that for

604
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:40,110
example if you want to play with Pokemon

605
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:42,300
go and don't want to go every time just

606
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:45,360
make an receiver that is always done it

607
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:47,280
in the same speed but think about the

608
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:51,419
right speed that you are not too fast

609
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:56,910
because Pokemon go is also detecting

610
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:59,730
when they spoof GPS signals yeah okay we

611
00:33:56,910 --> 00:34:03,990
need to download the file from the novel

612
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:05,670
website we have our own separated file

613
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:10,469
with our positioning that we need and

614
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:12,750
from that we can then generate and file

615
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:15,359
that's then called the simulation file

616
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:21,330
and this simulation file is done with

617
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:24,540
these with the yeah with the GPRS ER

618
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:26,279
simulator software so this generates an

619
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:29,850
binary file with all the information

620
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:33,950
needed so in the last thing what we then

621
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:37,380
do is this file we have tend to transmit

622
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:41,399
we have iron Ser device you can use the

623
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:44,880
heck RF a blade RF you can use a new

624
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:49,109
radio for that or you can just take for

625
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:51,750
example the your in a command line and

626
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:54,060
blade RF command line interface so here

627
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:56,280
you have the commands that you need so

628
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:58,740
we have to set a frequency on the right

629
00:34:56,280 --> 00:35:02,790
frequency so here in this case we have

630
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:06,450
two GPS the frequency used so of 1575

631
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:09,029
point four two megahertz then we need to

632
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:12,919
write sample rate in for GPS we need two

633
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:14,530
point six megahertz as a sample rate

634
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:19,120
with a bandwidth

635
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:25,800
of 2.5 mega yachts then important thing

636
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:29,730
is the signal gain so in this case we

637
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:33,520
we're reducing the the signal strengths

638
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:36,310
slightly not not slightly so already

639
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:38,350
very hard so because when you use a full

640
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:42,970
power to send it you're blasting too

641
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:45,759
much energy on the GPS track so just

642
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:50,680
reduce it as fast as much as possible

643
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:53,440
and then so minus 25 is this a good

644
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:59,129
beginning point if it sent too low you

645
00:35:53,440 --> 00:36:03,820
can slightly start putting in higher and

646
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:06,040
yeah and we need the generated file that

647
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:09,160
we had in the past so in the first step

648
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:13,540
we generated a simulation file in and in

649
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:19,120
this case now we using these in GPS sim

650
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:22,150
point a binary file as an input and it's

651
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:25,350
also said okay it's an binary format and

652
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:32,620
the last thing is then just submit it

653
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:38,980
and then you're done yeah I cannot show

654
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:42,910
how it is working now but yeah um in my

655
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:44,740
lab environment I added working in the

656
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:48,670
field it's a little bit complicated

657
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:51,879
because of sewing then also showing here

658
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:59,850
as a demo it's a little bit while ago

659
00:36:51,880 --> 00:37:01,630
yeah okay so back to the maritime part

660
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:04,538
we add

661
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:08,140
known that of we have learned that on

662
00:37:04,539 --> 00:37:11,319
the enemy Abbas on the canvas they are

663
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:14,740
also the GPS information so how we can

664
00:37:11,319 --> 00:37:17,440
also was that so when you have access

665
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:20,049
for example to the canvas then you can

666
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:24,039
put there some small computer device

667
00:37:20,049 --> 00:37:26,140
like and Raspberry Pi also and install

668
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:28,559
and software like the anime are a

669
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:34,210
generator for that so this is an

670
00:37:28,559 --> 00:37:36,880
software you can download at all soft so

671
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:39,880
it's called GPS simulator it's connected

672
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:43,690
and via a command yeah comm device a

673
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:46,269
serial port and then it just can send

674
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:50,019
out you faked GPS information onto the

675
00:37:46,269 --> 00:37:56,348
canvas of the ship so that's very easy

676
00:37:50,019 --> 00:37:58,598
for that um when you think now okay who

677
00:37:56,349 --> 00:38:02,220
will have access to an yacht to the

678
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:05,019
canvas for example you can rent them

679
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:08,019
just rent one of the bigger boats if you

680
00:38:05,019 --> 00:38:10,660
have enough money for that and then you

681
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:13,118
can you have access to all the devices

682
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:15,279
on the ship you have to find a slot for

683
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:18,009
that when the captain is not looking and

684
00:38:15,279 --> 00:38:20,859
then yeah you can do yourself what you

685
00:38:18,009 --> 00:38:23,920
want I think for 40 meter yacht you're

686
00:38:20,859 --> 00:38:27,460
paying one two hundred thousand euro for

687
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:30,390
one week or so when you rent it it's not

688
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:33,220
that much it's too much for me but yeah

689
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:39,308
yeah that's one scenario that you can

690
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:43,629
use and when you want also to experiment

691
00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:46,920
with GPS receivers this is a very cheap

692
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:49,509
device as the system on a chip

693
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:51,819
you only need power and then you have an

694
00:38:49,509 --> 00:38:54,450
serial port where you can get out

695
00:38:51,819 --> 00:38:59,910
already the GPS information so when you

696
00:38:54,450 --> 00:39:02,799
want to test your GPS spoofing device

697
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:04,839
just use one of those small things I

698
00:39:02,799 --> 00:39:06,369
think it costs a certain euro something

699
00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:08,519
like that you can buy them online on

700
00:39:06,369 --> 00:39:11,230
electronic stores and then you have

701
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:13,258
already the things that you need it for

702
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:17,440
you test

703
00:39:13,259 --> 00:39:20,740
yeah so now we knew that it is possible

704
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:27,150
to gemo spoof the signals but what we

705
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:30,879
can do for that so it's very hot jamming

706
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:33,960
how we can prevent jamming that's quite

707
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:38,289
difficult but there are already some

708
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:42,339
research projects and that so the German

709
00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:47,619
DLR as a research project called gallant

710
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:51,430
so on the right picture you see in sled

711
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:56,140
antennae the flat antenna is provided

712
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:58,690
within 2 by 2 antenna array and by

713
00:39:56,140 --> 00:40:01,808
having those antenna array they can

714
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:05,319
calculate because they know do a correct

715
00:40:01,809 --> 00:40:06,730
position of the satellites and was those

716
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:09,819
information then can carry out for like

717
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:13,059
ok when the satellite is sending the

718
00:40:09,819 --> 00:40:15,940
right signal all four antennas have the

719
00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:18,309
same information when there isn't

720
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:21,430
spoofing device for example it must be

721
00:40:18,309 --> 00:40:24,220
more or less from the site and antenna

722
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:25,868
array then detects ok maybe when they

723
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:27,700
sending from the left then the two

724
00:40:25,869 --> 00:40:29,289
antennas on the left have more earth

725
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:33,819
strength in the signal than the two

726
00:40:29,289 --> 00:40:36,039
antennas on the right and then the other

727
00:40:33,819 --> 00:40:39,460
position is already a is also from the

728
00:40:36,039 --> 00:40:41,799
air so by comparing those informations

729
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:45,309
then they can see okay there are some

730
00:40:41,799 --> 00:40:48,038
one spoofing and then they can filter

731
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:52,319
out actively the spoofed signal and

732
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:56,230
letting bypass only the original one

733
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:58,808
yeah when you go to the website the link

734
00:40:56,230 --> 00:41:00,519
is under the picture then you can read

735
00:40:58,809 --> 00:41:04,270
them more about that system how it is

736
00:41:00,519 --> 00:41:09,450
working so they still testing it

737
00:41:04,270 --> 00:41:11,800
the tests are very very positive and I

738
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:16,419
think in a couple of years we will have

739
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:20,530
it as an active system anywhere but what

740
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:25,150
else we can do last week I found

741
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:26,650
something let's buy a firewall so it's

742
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:31,560
this kind of new snake oil

743
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:35,109
I don't know so yeah there are already

744
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:36,759
GPS firewalls available so I found only

745
00:41:35,109 --> 00:41:39,880
one now

746
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:43,570
the blue sky a GPS firewall from Michael

747
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:48,369
see me yeah that's the first one that I

748
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:52,930
found now just buy it and this is what I

749
00:41:48,369 --> 00:41:54,849
claimed so it protects the GPS system

750
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:57,549
against poofing and jamming spreads

751
00:41:54,849 --> 00:42:00,580
software engineer engine analyzes the

752
00:41:57,550 --> 00:42:02,380
GPS signals and the GPS signal data is

753
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:04,089
received and ever you edited from each

754
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:05,650
satellite to ensure compliance along

755
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:08,020
with analyzing received signal

756
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:12,760
characteristics so that's what I claim

757
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:16,210
on their prospects um you just put a

758
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:18,849
device between the antenna and your

759
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:22,089
environment and then everything is fine

760
00:42:18,849 --> 00:42:27,310
hopefully I'm not sure I've not tested

761
00:42:22,089 --> 00:42:30,640
it I will try to buy one for the company

762
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:32,470
trust job we using also GPS receivers in

763
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:35,589
a company and build our stuff was dead

764
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:37,720
so I will try to look up how it is

765
00:42:35,589 --> 00:42:42,099
working and is it really working or not

766
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:46,990
I don't know yes so then we already

767
00:42:42,099 --> 00:42:51,000
coming to the last things GPS attacks of

768
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:53,560
course quite often so mostly jamming

769
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,109
first products are available for

770
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:59,890
protection one is commercial already and

771
00:42:56,109 --> 00:43:03,279
one is an a research project and also

772
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:05,279
spoofing is not that easy but it's still

773
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,170
possible

774
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:10,359
most of the URLs poofing test

775
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:12,310
environments also for the DIY are only

776
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:14,500
for the GPS sector for Galileo it's a

777
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:19,420
little bit complicated more

778
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:22,900
yeah and then I come to laughing may

779
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:32,560
default be with you and thank you for

780
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:42,310
attending my talk some questions anyone

781
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:47,710
oh dear good afternoon

782
00:43:42,310 --> 00:43:53,920
as I saw GPS satellite launched in 1973

783
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:55,960
and India launches 2013 right so the a

784
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:59,590
crazy my question is related to accuracy

785
00:43:55,960 --> 00:44:03,820
actually so the novice has a 1 meter

786
00:43:59,590 --> 00:44:07,240
accuracy and a GPS 20 to 30 meter of

787
00:44:03,820 --> 00:44:10,750
accuracy so for this one you mean yep so

788
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:15,549
my question is I mean GPS is developed

789
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:18,190
in 1973 so it's almost 50 years so I

790
00:44:15,550 --> 00:44:20,080
mean why they are crazy is not that much

791
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:22,480
effective and then India has that much

792
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:28,779
effective it 1 meter is a crazy so

793
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:30,940
that's what my question is did the ok

794
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:34,359
the development of the devices are

795
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:36,839
starting and already in 1973 but the

796
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:40,180
first satellites a couple of years later

797
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:46,060
and you are asking now why India has his

798
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:49,210
own satellite system India was wondering

799
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:52,480
also the Galileo project so they I think

800
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:55,150
300 millions they wanted to found into

801
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:58,000
the Galileo project but then a couple of

802
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:59,859
years later after they figured out that

803
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,349
also the Chinese peoples are a

804
00:44:59,859 --> 00:45:04,810
sponsoring Galileo then they said okay

805
00:45:02,349 --> 00:45:08,619
when China is also doing their stuff was

806
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:10,480
Galileo so we put our effort out of that

807
00:45:08,619 --> 00:45:12,369
and doing our own stuff because they are

808
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,609
frightened a little bit about the

809
00:45:12,369 --> 00:45:17,619
Chinese so that was the story that I

810
00:45:15,609 --> 00:45:19,270
figure out for that so and that was and

811
00:45:17,619 --> 00:45:23,740
the reason why they started the

812
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:26,140
development in 2004 or for their own

813
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:28,209
satellite system in India

814
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:32,890
so it's not planned as an global one but

815
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:35,200
only for local India - and the other

816
00:45:32,890 --> 00:45:37,150
thing is they don't want to rely on

817
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,348
anyone else so they build their own

818
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:40,450
satellites they build their own

819
00:45:38,349 --> 00:45:43,690
electronic built their own receiver and

820
00:45:40,450 --> 00:45:46,239
their own base station at the ground so

821
00:45:43,690 --> 00:45:48,910
that they can control it for themselves

822
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:52,839
and nobody is else responsible for that

823
00:45:48,910 --> 00:46:01,440
so that was I think the idea why India

824
00:45:52,839 --> 00:46:01,440
did his own one at a crazy

825
00:46:10,109 --> 00:46:17,210
depending on the

826
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:19,220
yeah on the signal what is ending so the

827
00:46:17,210 --> 00:46:22,420
positioning information and the accuracy

828
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:22,419
is also in the signal

829
00:46:22,450 --> 00:46:30,859
yeah it's modulated on the signal so so

830
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:37,780
GPS is a little bit not so accurate like

831
00:46:30,859 --> 00:46:37,779
Indian one maybe that helps a little bit

832
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:51,619
they'll pop me I didn't understand the

833
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:55,100
last things hello yeah oh yeah see apart

834
00:46:51,619 --> 00:46:57,580
from the positioning information we have

835
00:46:55,100 --> 00:47:01,310
just learned that Chinese are having

836
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:04,790
they are giving other facilities also

837
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:06,320
like messaging and all is it true or can

838
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:07,790
you throw some light on that means are

839
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:10,040
any other number from the positioning

840
00:47:07,790 --> 00:47:13,730
information is there any other facility

841
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:14,509
which is being provided by pi do that I

842
00:47:13,730 --> 00:47:20,600
don't know

843
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:25,670
no so I don't know about that yeah thank

844
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:30,470
you okay someone else actually I have

845
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:34,730
another questions okay so if I want to

846
00:47:30,470 --> 00:47:36,040
jam a signal of a satellite or a full

847
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:39,560
country is that possible

848
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:43,430
for me or the love I just want to block

849
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:46,369
I mean jam the signal of a satellite

850
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:48,200
yeah for a full country particular

851
00:47:46,369 --> 00:47:52,940
country I just want to jam all the

852
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:55,750
signal is that possible I think it's

853
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:58,640
possible but you need very strong

854
00:47:55,750 --> 00:48:02,119
transmitting devices to disturb all

855
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:07,339
those things it could be here but for a

856
00:48:02,119 --> 00:48:12,190
complete country yeah it's expensive but

857
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:21,339
maybe it's possible okay

858
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:26,980
thank you and one last question

859
00:48:21,339 --> 00:48:28,900
hello so we been using the it's not just

860
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:31,030
for the positioning it's also for the

861
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:33,150
time the global synchronization of

862
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:35,319
Tanqueray so are there any notable

863
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:39,390
spoofing events that have happened and

864
00:48:35,319 --> 00:48:40,509
disturb the time sink across the globe

865
00:48:39,390 --> 00:48:44,770
mmm

866
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:47,710
I've not really seen in a reported issue

867
00:48:44,770 --> 00:48:49,059
about that but though is it is it is

868
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:54,490
impossible to happen

869
00:48:49,059 --> 00:48:58,150
it is possible yeah some facilities are

870
00:48:54,490 --> 00:49:00,160
using a GPS receiver for an accurate

871
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:02,500
timing signal for synchronization of

872
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:05,649
data center for example so when you put

873
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:09,250
an drone with an spoofing device on it

874
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:12,210
over that you can manipulate the timing

875
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:17,170
signal also yeah that's possible but

876
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:18,849
I've not heard about and yeah about a

877
00:49:17,170 --> 00:49:20,680
new real case or not not something that

878
00:49:18,849 --> 00:49:21,670
has been reported but it's possible yeah

879
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:27,270
okay thank you

880
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:27,270
it is possible and are not reported yet

881
00:49:27,329 --> 00:49:33,220
okay and yeah if someone else has

882
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:36,029
questions I'm walking here outside and

883
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,029
then we can see
