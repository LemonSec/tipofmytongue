1
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:09,850
right hello everybody thank you for

2
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:12,489
attending my name is Kevin Barker and my

3
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:15,428
good friend here Chris Herbert we are

4
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:17,890
here today as part of our og to deliver

5
00:00:15,429 --> 00:00:22,000
our talk or unlocking the secrets of the

6
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:25,779
proxmark are to be for you a lot of you

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,160
already know Chris quite well Chris

8
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:31,509
iceberg will be taking us through some

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,580
of the various different attacks bits

10
00:00:31,510 --> 00:00:34,840
and pieces later on but before we do

11
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:36,190
that we'll give you a quick summary of

12
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,530
some of the other topics that we'll

13
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:41,530
cover first of all there's about ROG

14
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,820
about us what exactly is a proxmark but

15
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:44,950
a lot of people really sort of upper

16
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,870
stared what this hardware platform is

17
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:48,850
and what it's capable of so we'll give

18
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:51,788
you a quick walkthrough of that the

19
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:54,489
other is a few presentations and case

20
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:57,160
studies where the proxmark are dv4 has

21
00:00:54,489 --> 00:01:01,030
been used at the world to hard the

22
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,890
security there we'll move on to the

23
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:05,530
previous generations various different

24
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:07,360
limitations ed could to your advancement

25
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:11,619
so we've made to the product over the

26
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:17,229
years and yeah you see examples a queue

27
00:01:11,619 --> 00:01:21,820
right so and I'm Christian Holman and

28
00:01:17,229 --> 00:01:23,619
your guys knows me as ice man and I'm a

29
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:26,619
fight a researcher

30
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:29,619
we've been on the proxmark forum for six

31
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:31,770
years and I do software most of the time

32
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:34,540
and Microsoft Enterprise Architect

33
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:37,600
certified guy but that's just you know

34
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:40,060
my previous life and well you know my

35
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,890
popular form about things if you into

36
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:46,990
proxmox how many people in here know

37
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:49,689
what a proxy is oh we've got an educated

38
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:51,070
crowd and we got some fancy people here

39
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:52,779
as well did you know Adam lore is here

40
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:55,809
in the audience today it's amazing

41
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:57,550
keep it around repose for Adam

42
00:01:55,810 --> 00:01:59,900
[Applause]

43
00:01:57,550 --> 00:02:04,910
makes us nervous to have such a legends

44
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:08,810
here okay

45
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:12,770
I've know by the handle 0xffff I have

46
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:15,230
paid the NFC RFID researcher for the

47
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:16,520
proxmark for all quarter Peas

48
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,989
I'd like to do a lot of reverse

49
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,720
engineering generally aren't the person

50
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:24,110
that destroys the hardware Chris is the

51
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,990
builder of great many things what we've

52
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:30,230
done is a number of different smart card

53
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:32,750
technologies as well and as many of you

54
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:34,130
may know if you're proxmark owner

55
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:37,880
I'm also the abyss writer of the

56
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:39,410
proxmark 3 for Abed github repo be

57
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,700
taking care of that for over a decade

58
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:46,370
yeah which has been a lot of fun

59
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:51,709
all right Vivek forward we have the

60
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:54,380
proxmark 3 yeah this is often referred

61
00:02:51,709 --> 00:02:57,860
to as the Swiss Army knife of RFID

62
00:02:54,380 --> 00:03:00,950
research it is the go-to platform or 80

63
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:05,150
sort of attack based on NFC RFID but it

64
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:10,179
is now also part of 1726 contact

65
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:14,390
interfaces as well in addition to that

66
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:15,500
we've got a versatile tool with a number

67
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,089
of different plugins a number of

68
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,930
different adults that people have

69
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:23,269
developed a pull requests into the

70
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:28,580
github repo for extended functionality

71
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:38,450
it provided our high class attacks my

72
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:39,450
theory tax prep table etc yeah yeah ok

73
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,579
preview

74
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:45,149
work for center yeah we are well from

75
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:48,060
the since the proxmark has been around

76
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:49,890
for ten years at least there has been a

77
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:52,290
number of talks about it previously and

78
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:55,500
they covered pretty much of some basic

79
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:57,660
stuff about about RFID and what possible

80
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,390
to do with around proxmark so you have a

81
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:03,209
frame brown speak 2014 on black hat

82
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:04,768
watch it he didn't do very much on the

83
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,660
my fire stuff because he got stopped

84
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:10,440
from his job worked for NSA or something

85
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:13,709
about you have Craig John on DEFCON 20

86
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:17,399
free he made an excellent speak about

87
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:19,530
how to make more stuff into the proxmark

88
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,950
code and explain how the code works a

89
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:25,859
bit because that's kind of messed up and

90
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:30,210
yeah we well learning in the field is

91
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:32,700
how to pen testers like to do and yeah

92
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:36,750
we did a speak lost autumn November

93
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:39,960
about things yeah go on watch them it's

94
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:42,419
kind of fun we did some man last year

95
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,289
was kind of exciting year if you into

96
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:47,669
RFID hacking and because were some

97
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:52,080
high-profile and practical applications

98
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:54,450
from it we can say yeah sure if any of

99
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,409
you have made aware of the Tesla Model S

100
00:04:54,450 --> 00:05:00,630
key club key for quoting attack that was

101
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:03,870
carried out not so long ago but that was

102
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:06,060
using the proxmark since they're the

103
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:08,580
vehicle entry system had been upgraded

104
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,780
to mitigate these attacks this is where

105
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:14,940
the proxmark three comes in real handy

106
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:18,000
in addition to that we also had the very

107
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:21,030
popular as a ploy pink card hack the

108
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,210
hotel card hack which left a lot of

109
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:26,099
hotel rooms essentially unlocked for

110
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:28,320
quite a long period of time before there

111
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:30,510
was a hardware later Hardware generation

112
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,330
introduced to the market which is

113
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:35,550
slightly be introduced into hotel chains

114
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:38,599
throughout the world it had quite a

115
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:42,240
negative impact of these traits because

116
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:45,630
you know having a thousand hotel room

117
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,919
doors open all of a sudden is is quite a

118
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:49,530
bad thing to have happened but that's

119
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:52,380
why we've got this out of e4

120
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,008
platform to be able to buy these risks

121
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:57,779
admit ago

122
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:59,400
as soon as possible but most of you

123
00:05:57,779 --> 00:06:00,779
people are not interesting on mitigating

124
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,568
things you're mostly important you know

125
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:05,939
to learn to break things

126
00:06:02,569 --> 00:06:08,789
anyway previous generations yep so

127
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:12,599
starting for the beginning we had a very

128
00:06:08,789 --> 00:06:16,649
basic proxmark at the original proxmark

129
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:19,860
board that had a lack of interface

130
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:22,499
options on it was quite bulky connecting

131
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:26,069
external rotators etc was quite

132
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:29,759
complicated required a reasonable

133
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:33,689
understanding of NFC RFID along with

134
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:37,860
embedded development FPGA experience and

135
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:40,379
so on the end result was a bulky product

136
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:42,839
with even larger rotators poor quality

137
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:44,930
control because we had multiple people

138
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:48,379
committing to the repository and

139
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:51,689
resulting in messy code spaghetti code

140
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:54,330
and that on top of that we've also got

141
00:06:51,689 --> 00:06:57,930
clunky weird leads and plugs that people

142
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,758
couldn't acquire and there was

143
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:02,580
unreliable Hardware revisions that came

144
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:04,139
out into the market and there was

145
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:07,469
nothing covert about it it wasn't

146
00:07:04,139 --> 00:07:10,110
suitable for red teamers etc so we

147
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:14,009
decided that it's necessary to make some

148
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:17,719
changes to the hardware platform we

149
00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:21,419
certainly need skin doors again

150
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:23,819
addressing these limitations well we

151
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:26,039
want to look good so the original

152
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:30,539
proxmark was quite large the new

153
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:33,180
proxmark is quite literally a quarter of

154
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:35,339
the size of the original proxmark yes

155
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:36,809
chipping in weed when we're supposed to

156
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:38,309
have a GoPro here will show you of a

157
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:39,539
differences between those because we

158
00:07:38,309 --> 00:07:41,069
haven't laying down there but we're

159
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:46,019
waiting for the camera to come in and

160
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:49,680
once that coming we show em yeah we've

161
00:07:46,019 --> 00:07:51,809
introduced a flexible RF interface where

162
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:54,959
customer tells to be bolted onto the

163
00:07:51,809 --> 00:07:57,389
proxmark so custom designs could allow

164
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:02,699
for embedded tokens

165
00:07:57,389 --> 00:08:06,050
- hi shield antennas embedded capsules

166
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:09,199
for anybody that's into bio hacking and

167
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:11,659
greed rage our elephant hf rage

168
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,129
improvements are considerable compared

169
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:16,190
to the other options that are available

170
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:18,770
on the market today on top of that we've

171
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:21,560
also got two megabit flash memory for

172
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:23,900
storing keys in Korea dictionary attacks

173
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:27,110
a seven eight one six contact interface

174
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:30,948
for sip based credentials or contact IC

175
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:32,539
credentials a its covert Thea that's

176
00:08:30,949 --> 00:08:35,269
quite small it confited your pocket

177
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:37,789
nobody had even don't I carry one I'd be

178
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:42,049
all the time and it's the size of a

179
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:45,529
credit card he can't he can't make it

180
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:48,529
any smaller that really that we

181
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:51,950
introduced at FPC four active antennas

182
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:54,769
you Arts Bluetooth battery the expansion

183
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:57,740
options with disclosed publicly in the

184
00:08:54,769 --> 00:09:05,269
past so other developers can introduce

185
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:07,940
new features into the product here we

186
00:09:05,269 --> 00:09:11,149
have the flexible RF interface the

187
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:14,180
mechanical design layout and the

188
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:15,110
interface description before the 125-130

189
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,930
for kilohertz

190
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:19,339
atever at the 3085 six hour if you want

191
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:27,949
to make your own if you want to make

192
00:09:19,339 --> 00:09:31,209
Europe sure and we also added a little

193
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:35,209
bit some memory on their box mug because

194
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:37,189
it has limited amount of memory as it

195
00:09:35,209 --> 00:09:39,229
was before with for that you would need

196
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:41,930
to have some more way of store things

197
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,910
and you can't put on a more slots and SD

198
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:45,949
memory cards we managed to get a little

199
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:47,779
bit of memory only so flash memory which

200
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:50,390
is actually a bit different than a

201
00:09:47,779 --> 00:09:52,180
normal around memory or so we have

202
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:55,490
limits with that so it comes up to like

203
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:56,989
four six four kilobyte pages which is

204
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:00,050
divided into sixteen sectors or four

205
00:09:56,990 --> 00:10:04,130
case each so you can actually yes read

206
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:05,569
or write for K pages at a time so if you

207
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:07,279
have previously you have to read all

208
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:09,440
four men you have to wipe it on and on

209
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,360
again it's kind of little strange but we

210
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,429
added

211
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,649
a very good some commands for supporting

212
00:10:12,429 --> 00:10:17,379
for it's kind of easy to do it and we

213
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:18,730
will demonstrate that later on and what

214
00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:23,259
are you use it for is of course see if

215
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:25,629
you have a stand alone mooks stand alone

216
00:10:23,259 --> 00:10:27,279
modes where you will want to have a

217
00:10:25,629 --> 00:10:29,889
battery option and then you want to do

218
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,739
things without a computer or laptop

219
00:10:29,889 --> 00:10:34,660
standing in front of a reader or in a

220
00:10:32,739 --> 00:10:37,029
real test Senora for pen testers the red

221
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:39,160
teamers whatever they will find it's not

222
00:10:37,029 --> 00:10:42,579
very covert standing there like I'm here

223
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:44,618
in front of look you ever try that you

224
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:47,799
know in that I can negate seems like you

225
00:10:44,619 --> 00:10:49,839
see this little camera there's like no

226
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:51,129
that's not very cool but is it so if you

227
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,420
do that with a pop smoke you have a

228
00:10:51,129 --> 00:10:54,100
little battery out on and you can use

229
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:57,160
those things and you rewrite the code a

230
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:59,350
bit and you look kind of covert to doing

231
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:06,040
it that's why we had this in mind we

232
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:10,119
thought about it context analysis so of

233
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:12,040
the Box walk out of a pool we have an

234
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:13,480
odd module would like to show you that

235
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,969
we don't have the video after running

236
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,499
just yet unfortunately but it it's

237
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:20,619
adorable that sits on top of the

238
00:11:17,499 --> 00:11:25,059
proxmark ITV for enabling us to be able

239
00:11:20,619 --> 00:11:28,389
to attach any sort of 7.16 based contact

240
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:31,059
chip card yeah one of the reasons for

241
00:11:28,389 --> 00:11:32,949
that was because nowadays this card says

242
00:11:31,059 --> 00:11:35,939
you should do all interfaces for contact

243
00:11:32,949 --> 00:11:39,998
less than the contact and like being the

244
00:11:35,939 --> 00:11:42,519
payment systems so we thought we would

245
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:46,480
like to do that in the same device and a

246
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:48,999
fun thing yeah a PDUs could be set

247
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,949
directly through from the proxmark fight

248
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:53,739
to the card said responses can be

249
00:11:50,949 --> 00:11:55,569
acquired eight years etc are all

250
00:11:53,739 --> 00:11:58,480
available there head the character

251
00:11:55,569 --> 00:12:00,189
Reaper it's kind of a small size package

252
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,350
so we didn't have very much place to put

253
00:12:00,189 --> 00:12:04,329
it so it's hidden underneath the casing

254
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,879
and we need to do a full size extender

255
00:12:04,329 --> 00:12:08,529
to which you see how it looks like

256
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:13,029
that's what it enables the functionality

257
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:16,179
basically and the supporting is firmware

258
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:19,240
and midnight for is this new SC and eme

259
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:20,209
commands up there this was not in last

260
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,589
November

261
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:23,569
now we have it online so we can actually

262
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:26,660
demonstrate it but yeah so that's why

263
00:12:23,569 --> 00:12:28,579
this slide is here but if she shows with

264
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:31,790
possibilities and raw ayat views and

265
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:33,410
things over contact interface does

266
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:38,449
anybody know what I speak about when I

267
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:40,100
say raw ATP use okay hateful yeah okay

268
00:12:38,449 --> 00:12:44,959
it was one or two of you guys alright

269
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:45,529
yeah okay yes testing the limits oh yeah

270
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:48,649
okay

271
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:50,929
yes we've work well without a camera at

272
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:54,290
the permit which is limited their

273
00:12:50,929 --> 00:12:56,499
options considerably and also had defect

274
00:12:54,290 --> 00:13:04,059
or their presentation

275
00:12:56,499 --> 00:13:06,709
no sir what we want to is mm-hm

276
00:13:04,059 --> 00:13:08,329
so we've got strike it yeah so we're

277
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:11,239
back again all right all right all right

278
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:13,868
and you want me to do the demonstration

279
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,869
anyway

280
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:21,139
you will see Iceman hack and cards no no

281
00:13:18,319 --> 00:13:29,240
no you don't want that all right little

282
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:31,699
bit fun all right let's see have you

283
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,790
ever you know out of you guys who use

284
00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:37,459
the proxmark and download the repo do

285
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:40,189
you use the right repo you remember that

286
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:42,739
and for this box mock or before you

287
00:13:40,189 --> 00:13:44,209
should use for rrg repo because that's

288
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:47,179
where i added the most of the latest

289
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:48,859
functionality supporting stuff and once

290
00:13:47,179 --> 00:13:50,540
you download it and pull the latest

291
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:54,649
because even yesterday we pushed some

292
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:56,269
fixes that are funny and yeah you need

293
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:58,429
to compile it and once you get all that

294
00:13:56,269 --> 00:13:59,929
set it up and you know and unblocking

295
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:08,899
drivers and stuff like that it's kind of

296
00:13:59,929 --> 00:14:12,040
easy to run and sorry Oh Roger

297
00:14:08,899 --> 00:14:12,040
how do you that

298
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:24,000
see that work is about big enough

299
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:26,080
everybody can say that in reads

300
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:30,310
excellent let's see if I can reverse all

301
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:32,920
right I'm running it that was clear so

302
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:36,250
um to be proximal client calling it up

303
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:38,170
you could actually run bash scripts

304
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:40,209
directly about that sorry so you see the

305
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:44,949
you know once you starting your starter

306
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:46,899
Matt you can do that yeah okay and okay

307
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,490
if you look at that first line there

308
00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:50,709
it's important to notice what you have

309
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:53,950
actually is support for in the client

310
00:14:50,709 --> 00:14:55,270
and what we want to do is finding out

311
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:56,950
what kind of support for hardware you

312
00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:00,220
have in the device so we have is

313
00:14:56,950 --> 00:15:02,380
commands we test you cause first is HP

314
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:05,529
version which you see and then we have a

315
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:09,070
sway status which tells you a little bit

316
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:11,290
more as Hodges efficiency oops but it

317
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:14,920
gives you about the onboard memories

318
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:17,770
what FPGA loaded image this one is IHF

319
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:20,439
right now the flash memory saying how

320
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:22,900
much is up there you see also that we

321
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:24,370
have a smart card module added to it and

322
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,040
this is important for you guys to have

323
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:29,470
it once you buy one of these and if it

324
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,360
says an alien number of an version 3.10

325
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:34,120
in the firmware there you need to

326
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,310
upgrade the firmware for that one which

327
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:38,200
are all indicated in the wiki pages and

328
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,609
stuff okay

329
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,290
we fought that a lot of people will

330
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:42,459
purchase the proxmark for the first time

331
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:45,189
at a stupe that they've got the latest

332
00:15:42,459 --> 00:15:46,989
firmware it's definitely not always the

333
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:48,400
case the number one thing that you

334
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:52,300
should be doing is going straight to the

335
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:55,150
github repo go to the ROG repo make a

336
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:57,760
copy of the latest and compile and

337
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:59,410
upgrade to a box marked the other is

338
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,930
just as Chris said make sure that the

339
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:05,620
the version for the spark our module is

340
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:06,969
at 3.1 all right so right now we're go

341
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,520
to camera and we're gonna just

342
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:13,170
demonstrate the chips to live the

343
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,170
priests religious all right

344
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:25,209
Hey good move forward it's good okay so

345
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:28,750
first of all we have the original

346
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:34,180
proxmark three this this particular

347
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:35,440
project was developed by jonathan best

348
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:37,239
thieves thank you

349
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:41,890
ten years ago yep Jonathan of states

350
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:45,550
mess face yeah it's natal and sorry it

351
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:48,100
has yeah that's basically the bait board

352
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:51,760
that that kicked off the proxmark that

353
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:56,070
we know today it's got the dreaded high

354
00:16:51,760 --> 00:17:00,430
rose connector it's also got some bulky

355
00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:02,890
JTAG connectors aids very very limited

356
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:05,619
expansion options overall but the

357
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:08,740
product was absolutely fantastic because

358
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:11,319
that enabled people to do the crypto one

359
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,949
attack it was very famous back at the

360
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:16,329
time it's still very practical today

361
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:18,850
dead after that there was a number of

362
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:20,740
different variants that came out as part

363
00:17:18,849 --> 00:17:24,938
of it improvement of the original design

364
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:28,240
we've got the our db2 that that came out

365
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:30,820
afterwards not necessarily in order but

366
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,270
yeah there's some other units that we've

367
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:40,149
got here just to show the improvements

368
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:43,660
of the RF connectors yep and EDD battery

369
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:46,510
options yeah that's right that we've

370
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:49,780
also got the O 2 V 3 which was released

371
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:54,640
all that long ago again more attempts to

372
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:56,050
try condense the desired tried reduce

373
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,840
the overall footprint

374
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:02,080
it makes the antennas interchangeable

375
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:04,659
easily interchangeable we did like any

376
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:08,860
of that so we decided to make it

377
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:10,510
infinitely smaller it is the R to be for

378
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:13,178
they are compared to the original

379
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:14,530
proxmark there's a considerable size

380
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:18,309
difference between the two we've put a

381
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:19,450
lot of time and effort into this and all

382
00:18:18,309 --> 00:18:21,340
the features that we mentioned earlier

383
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,380
with a 2 megabit flash of the seven

384
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:24,970
eight one six interface they're all

385
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:28,270
features that are unique to the art of

386
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:37,000
e4 and the sin

387
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:39,929
yeah excellent you will get off a

388
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,700
 little bit but I'm almost

389
00:18:39,929 --> 00:18:47,790
excellent well that's how it looks like

390
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,790
and yeah we've antennas it looks like

391
00:18:49,710 --> 00:19:07,110
now you're look again is it isn't it no

392
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:25,139
we're switching to low let's try again

393
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:29,010
that's mine

394
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:45,590
as I

395
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:47,720
business you're so nice excitement yes

396
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,830
sir pleasure thank you yeah thank you

397
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,570
thank you so much

398
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,610
so if you see it's a double antenna

399
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:56,000
where a large antenna is the HF antenna

400
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:57,679
modified and the dual antenna of LF part

401
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,260
is this here it's a separate Annabeth's

402
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:02,360
screw it on top of this one it's a very

403
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:05,720
compact nice solution compared to the

404
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:07,729
wire frames you see before once and this

405
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:13,670
is so sexy this one starts over and it's

406
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:17,120
really smooth soft and silky as well and

407
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:19,250
now we off again alright back to this

408
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:20,689
one so once you decide that you know

409
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,700
what your phone way or it looks great

410
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:23,930
and you can now also I'm going back here

411
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,460
and you can also see that your

412
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:27,140
communications with the device is

413
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:29,110
working you can also see which installed

414
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:34,820
installation is standalone mode which is

415
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:36,889
you need to detect the antenna powers to

416
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:40,159
make sure that you have a working device

417
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:43,180
you guys should with 1hv tune it takes a

418
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:45,950
while because it does measure things and

419
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:48,380
there you go you see you get out the

420
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:53,060
clock window recently the pike here's

421
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:56,420
the the focus on the 125 kilohertz

422
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:59,179
signal that's also visualisation of it

423
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:02,300
you see this pair leftt values 4 or 5

424
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:04,610
volts and the HF antenna is 50 volts it

425
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:05,899
says a very good value so you know that

426
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:10,729
you have a working fully operational

427
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:14,510
device now what to do we would need a

428
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:17,770
card Kevin do you have a card

429
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:22,960
oh well I got what I'll be let's say

430
00:21:17,770 --> 00:21:22,960
well this one that we give that a shot

431
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:30,290
hmm

432
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:33,080
where I've seen this card before that

433
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:37,720
was a suitable paper pocket I put this

434
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:40,820
one over here oh it's there and now

435
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:44,750
we'll go back again and we wonder what

436
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:46,520
kind of tag this is you can try it's two

437
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:49,700
starting points basically one is there

438
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:52,820
HF high-frequency search go on or you go

439
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,930
for the whoops or you go for the LF such

440
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:57,110
qualms

441
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:59,960
well let's see it's a hotel system I'm

442
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:01,520
pretty sure they chipped actually I do

443
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,180
know that but you know it's just full

444
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,430
follow it

445
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:05,630
and another thing you notice me when I

446
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:08,060
write things I don't write out the

447
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:10,490
commands completely because the proximal

448
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:12,710
commands that is kind of scary in one

449
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:14,690
way and really easy to get confused

450
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:16,420
about but we try to add a lot of help

451
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:18,770
text so we all usually have the H

452
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:20,660
parameter to try to see if get the help

453
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:22,639
tips out and who explains for command in

454
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:24,710
many ways this is a very complex device

455
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,020
and complex concepts but if you're on

456
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,700
page of search its tries to detect them

457
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:31,460
voila it found something it founds a

458
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:33,680
Mifare classic card it also detects

459
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:36,740
whether it not is a magic Chinese back

460
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,390
you are a card which is not this looks

461
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:40,970
like it's a yam in my for classic car

462
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:42,710
and you see the PRN detection is

463
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:46,130
something where it on thanks to Philip

464
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:49,280
and other people to detect whether or

465
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:51,140
not this car is suspect able to the dark

466
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:57,110
side attack do you know about the dark

467
00:22:51,140 --> 00:23:01,430
side attack who knows about that I don't

468
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:03,320
know ok all right ok that's one way of

469
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:06,050
getting the crypto oligarchy for this

470
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:08,000
kind of title cards but if you don't do

471
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:11,629
that I usually start somewhere else I

472
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:15,770
usually start with testing the default

473
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:18,350
keys why it's because usually cards

474
00:23:15,770 --> 00:23:20,000
comes with default keys and for that we

475
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,500
have the knife err if you look for the

476
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,440
knife once you can see it comes up there

477
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,700
it's something called a check if you do

478
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:29,800
that the help takes port you can see

479
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:37,040
this here almost 1k card that's one and

480
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:39,169
I will use the default keys dictionary

481
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:42,800
file for this loading it up for my

482
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:44,750
clients and execute it it looks at 406

483
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,720
and 494 cases what I found in my little

484
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:49,870
fort happily shared whoever once else so

485
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:53,060
far is found yet found all of keys

486
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:56,330
chop-chop so job done yeah this cards

487
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:57,980
all Tripoli keys found east and done and

488
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:59,679
now you want to do something the problem

489
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:02,450
is that you need to have a little

490
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:06,140
dictionary file we didn't save that ones

491
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:07,550
we try to run it again to get the key

492
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:12,170
file needed to dumb

493
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:15,379
this card you see has been saved next

494
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:19,700
one to dump a file our classic order is

495
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:21,140
for hf m f dump come on I will to H as

496
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,880
well so you see the help text it's very

497
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,650
simple con that one so you can just

498
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:28,880
basically qur'anic off you got that key

499
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:31,760
file out there it just does this boom

500
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,940
boom boom boom boom there we've copied

501
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:39,800
over all of the block data off the card

502
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:42,860
yes so now we've made a clear no not

503
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:44,480
automatically made a copy of it yeah we

504
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:46,280
did also some other change we need you

505
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,140
of these things is that you get the

506
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:50,330
binary file and binary files it's not

507
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:52,430
easy to read when we made this AML file

508
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:55,070
format which you can look at the hex

509
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:57,620
text basically from the dump file of the

510
00:24:55,070 --> 00:25:00,050
binaries but that's also still not good

511
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:02,060
enough so we just recently added JSON

512
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:04,460
format to explain more about the tags so

513
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:06,139
if you want to look at this card it

514
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:08,000
comes down since I started my client

515
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:16,190
Foley I need to go there and be a name

516
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:17,770
is hf MF - DD that would be this one if

517
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:21,830
you want to see this one right up now

518
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:24,590
and I said too small for as well but you

519
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:27,679
can see it's done Firefox mark and it's

520
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:29,570
all the blobs here AATA curious is

521
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,070
needed for if you want to make a yeah

522
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:33,409
knowing clone of is caught later on

523
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:36,889
here's all the keys here's the access

524
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:38,930
conditions bytes what was up use the

525
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:41,300
data 69 is a special little thing we

526
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:42,410
have a sexy trailer and it goes on for

527
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,360
whole thing so this is a very good

528
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:45,650
format and we did manage to get if you

529
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:48,879
have an Android phone you don't have a

530
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:50,900
prop smoke we've made you know

531
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:55,130
possibility to read an export-based

532
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:58,460
files between the MCT MCT tool from this

533
00:25:55,130 --> 00:26:01,280
ikura sky from germany and if you don't

534
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:02,840
have it you go and use it we should also

535
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,450
sooner or later when the people from

536
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:08,510
liberal us be getting on the track again

537
00:26:05,450 --> 00:26:10,040
I'm not looking at you Adam and we get

538
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:14,780
their support for the Asian file there

539
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:16,070
as well and so now you have a copy of a

540
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,139
chord that's happy and done you can

541
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:20,620
actually get the just loaded up the ml

542
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:22,960
I'll finally make the proxmark now

543
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:25,030
simulate this tag so if I would have a

544
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:26,920
run battery option it could have just

545
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:29,500
done that and you can present it

546
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,210
anywhere and do it this is basically you

547
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:34,270
know that the functionality of doing

548
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:37,240
something simple this is how their fun

549
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:39,730
was it is this oh my this is for safety

550
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,680
net flower and this is so simple but

551
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:44,260
it's not simple because it's easy to do

552
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:47,410
around the commands it's easy because 10

553
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:49,270
years of knowledge has gone into making

554
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:52,780
this proxmark attack and proximate

555
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:54,550
clients so easy to use it's not easy if

556
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:56,410
you would do from scratch you would have

557
00:26:54,550 --> 00:27:02,740
a hard time cracking these babies trust

558
00:26:56,410 --> 00:27:05,559
me I don't even think I will be ok yeah

559
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:09,340
with with the event of technology that's

560
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:10,389
got it to the art of a fall we're

561
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:12,580
resting on the shoulders of giants

562
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:14,130
there's a lot of crypto analysts that

563
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:16,449
have spent a lot of years researching

564
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:20,410
the vulnerabilities within cards of

565
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:27,760
these types such as the PRA G's it tra

566
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:28,059
G's it yeah we've just a food sorry

567
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,679
about that

568
00:27:28,059 --> 00:27:35,678
oh cool yeah well anyway thanks to that

569
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:39,250
one and now let's see two and read D for

570
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:40,990
kiss let's do something it comes down to

571
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:42,400
speed in one of the times it took some

572
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:44,530
time to get dropped these keys and I

573
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,780
want to show you we add a very onboard

574
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:49,740
memory support for the device and you

575
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:54,030
can actually upload the dictionary files

576
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:57,370
onto the flash memory by easily onto the

577
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:59,320
prop smoker before and it's up there and

578
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:01,059
if you want to verify that you got it we

579
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:02,700
added in a little scripts a little

580
00:28:01,059 --> 00:28:05,260
script there's another loss magical

581
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:06,820
additions we have in M proxmark you can

582
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:08,440
run scripts make your own instead of

583
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:09,610
compiling the source code and see and

584
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,890
you can see if you don't like that you

585
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:13,750
can make Lua scripts here you see it

586
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:17,230
downloads always and verifies is found

587
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:19,720
649 passwords which is on the device now

588
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:21,460
you want to use that mother so if you

589
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:23,470
take the back with my hotel room key

590
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:28,540
that's actually my hotel room so please

591
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:30,970
don't copy it like I did and if you go

592
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,389
for the F check come on again they go

593
00:28:30,970 --> 00:28:33,810
for help

594
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:36,330
and you see this option here called

595
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:39,540
use dictionary from flash memory OOP you

596
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:43,500
see this one here so if I add that to it

597
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:45,840
it will now run purely on the device it

598
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:49,530
doesn't use the client to verify their

599
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,270
keys and find it and exchange value

600
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:54,000
about that one where it cuts down the

601
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:55,860
time this takes about 5.6 second 5.9

602
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,410
seconds to find the keys the four keys

603
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:00,870
found in it it's kind of fast which is

604
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:02,370
good and from there I can of course done

605
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:05,100
you know save the files and keep on

606
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:07,770
doing what I did but this is the support

607
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:09,300
and strength of onboard flash memory

608
00:29:07,770 --> 00:29:11,190
because you can get you can do things

609
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:12,690
save family case you can save it you can

610
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:14,970
do more things where it's not

611
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:16,710
implemented all of this into the source

612
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:18,210
code it's up for you guys to start

613
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:20,630
adding to it you know I'm looking

614
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:20,630
forward for that

615
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:27,870
so next step wing lock do you know about

616
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:35,160
those nobody knows what wing lock what

617
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:37,500
are they edge heads do you go on this

618
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:47,810
piece for the others of people speak

619
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:52,370
about the wing lock your camera okay

620
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:55,970
generic big-block card this was part of

621
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:58,340
a famous hack just recently I could be

622
00:29:55,970 --> 00:30:02,390
go essentially all hotel rooms using

623
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:06,199
this technology type what we have now is

624
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:11,720
the ability to execute that particular

625
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:12,890
attack straight of the rav4 there you

626
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,780
know if you want to take this one we

627
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:16,430
know that we can run for come on you see

628
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:19,250
it's an my FAL threat

629
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:21,890
eveyone tag and for that we have a

630
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:23,630
special commands called hf m fu it's

631
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:25,700
very confusing this little MF things

632
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:27,710
isn't it well yeah you get the hang of

633
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,600
if I do that you see what we have you

634
00:30:27,710 --> 00:30:31,970
can do most of that you want to run the

635
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:34,040
info come on and see what you can read

636
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:35,300
out a big tag right away you get a

637
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,240
little bit knows when you read the last

638
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:40,310
thing bag you should be and if you go up

639
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,350
here receive it was a Milton my Farrell

640
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:44,629
delights this version of the source code

641
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:46,399
is my private so it has a next

642
00:30:44,630 --> 00:30:49,160
ratification so I know that this is a

643
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:51,290
lean look and you would under why for

644
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:55,580
those who wonders of how that hack went

645
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:58,820
out last spring was the wing look the

646
00:30:55,580 --> 00:31:01,520
f-secure guys 140 million hotel locks

647
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:03,260
was in jeopardy it's because one of the

648
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,900
protections was this one time per and

649
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:07,640
the calculation of that one means I can

650
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:10,280
vary father is it doesn't use phone both

651
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:12,650
signature for it when we dumped this one

652
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:15,290
since it's usually use a default

653
00:31:12,650 --> 00:31:16,610
password for so you can dump this one

654
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:19,220
pretty easy just like that

655
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:21,889
however you cannot write the one-time

656
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:25,130
pad we know that but in my version of

657
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:29,090
this just to prove you something where's

658
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:32,590
come on called TVN and we we've used a

659
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:35,060
new option or it will use for tag ID and

660
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:37,730
yeah you can actually calculate about

661
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:39,139
yourself and as you see if you had a my

662
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:41,630
for classic you were able to do that as

663
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:45,280
well but yeah that's just to prove you

664
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:50,030
to you that the thing lock things are

665
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:55,790
very unsecure as they were but yeah it's

666
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:57,860
fun though it's good fun so back to the

667
00:31:55,790 --> 00:32:01,450
new functionalities we got the smart

668
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:04,748
card things yes now please

669
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:07,489
don't look at this card it's a Visa card

670
00:32:04,749 --> 00:32:10,070
it's expired basically it is an expired

671
00:32:07,489 --> 00:32:14,960
visa card so doesn't exist to people so

672
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:19,359
no yeah so yeah oh yeah let me see this

673
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:19,359
this is one of us dual interface things

674
00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:24,529
so we can do two things you have a chip

675
00:32:23,059 --> 00:32:28,309
oh yeah let's do that

676
00:32:24,529 --> 00:32:30,200
you can you have a little chip or we can

677
00:32:28,309 --> 00:32:31,700
use the contact last things I will just

678
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:35,210
demonstrate that we just plug in the

679
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:40,340
extender do this one there and you see

680
00:32:35,210 --> 00:32:41,899
that is in and back here and see the

681
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:47,119
spot caught function is called ethical

682
00:32:41,899 --> 00:32:48,918
ooh how do you go all right cool so the

683
00:32:47,119 --> 00:32:51,019
info about this one you see this is you

684
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:52,609
get the eight you are and its calculator

685
00:32:51,019 --> 00:32:55,369
shows what that's it doesn't say very

686
00:32:52,609 --> 00:32:57,199
much but you have the ability to send

687
00:32:55,369 --> 00:33:00,199
raw eight videos to it and talk to it

688
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:02,019
and see a trace list of what happens

689
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:05,649
with this communication with its card

690
00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:08,539
however yes recently like in December

691
00:33:05,649 --> 00:33:11,059
merlok yeah another user from the forum

692
00:33:08,539 --> 00:33:13,039
and has been working very hard with is a

693
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:16,609
new commands that we call the EMV cards

694
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:22,940
it's for this set visa mostly cause and

695
00:33:16,609 --> 00:33:24,949
all that and you can use those too this

696
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:29,119
is another thing is here you have view -

697
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:31,399
age to get use both the contact

698
00:33:29,119 --> 00:33:34,728
interface and you have can also use to

699
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:36,619
contact less interface so you will

700
00:33:34,729 --> 00:33:38,389
select this one we will do the Wyatt

701
00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:41,269
because we cooked up to that and we want

702
00:33:38,389 --> 00:33:44,359
to see the chevelle decoded results from

703
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:48,889
this one says the channel contact reads

704
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:50,989
it out and boom the reading stuff out of

705
00:33:48,889 --> 00:33:54,109
this one I hope I'm not showing too much

706
00:33:50,989 --> 00:33:56,960
now hope I didn't do that no it's not

707
00:33:54,109 --> 00:33:58,668
too bad oh that's not too bad it's yeah

708
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,330
it's just for purity yeah yeah great

709
00:33:58,669 --> 00:34:03,769
that we have the TL do yeah that's good

710
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:06,109
now let's take it out again and put it

711
00:34:03,769 --> 00:34:07,820
on the reader so now we use me and my

712
00:34:06,109 --> 00:34:10,038
contact list format verified a part of

713
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:13,609
it which would be the same command but

714
00:34:10,039 --> 00:34:14,260
without the W and you can read out there

715
00:34:13,609 --> 00:34:16,629
from

716
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:18,190
and face the same values so this is for

717
00:34:16,629 --> 00:34:20,770
strength what we wanted to see in our

718
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:24,760
before the ability to look at the dual

719
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:26,350
interface cards at the same time it's

720
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,109
like the thing I got here so now this is

721
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:30,339
a 4k Mifare classic card and it does it

722
00:34:29,109 --> 00:34:31,869
has a chip on it and that's the actual

723
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:33,010
mag stripe on it's almost like very

724
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:36,100
confused why do you have this as an

725
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:38,609
entry system but we did yeah oops maybe

726
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,609
I shouldn't do that either

727
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:45,460
anyway yeah it so it's this order before

728
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:47,138
makes you possible to do more things

729
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,580
look at this you want to analyze things

730
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:50,740
you want to look at data you want to get

731
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:52,840
data out of it and now it responds and

732
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:54,668
more times it does man so this is what

733
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,409
we want to deal with those and we re

734
00:34:54,668 --> 00:35:00,670
about suppose for a support felt because

735
00:34:56,409 --> 00:35:02,470
we felt this it lacked that and we did

736
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:04,240
also add their rocket test you know what

737
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:06,640
we rock our vulnerability to return of a

738
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:10,689
coppersmith attack you know what that

739
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,470
was okay turn out one of those smart

740
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:17,230
card ships

741
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:18,009
do you know others oh okay yeah well

742
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:23,520
yeah it's the infamous

743
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:26,140
anyway and the the Estonian e

744
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,660
identification card for country had as

745
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:30,250
some research look at the smart card the

746
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:32,649
signature service which are certificates

747
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:35,970
on that my own is the critical is

748
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:40,240
circuit on this cards not this one and

749
00:35:35,970 --> 00:35:42,879
they found out that the randomness in

750
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:44,618
most generated RSA keys was bad and I

751
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:46,330
call it a return of a coppersmith attack

752
00:35:44,619 --> 00:35:48,640
or recoup Smith attack and then someone

753
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:50,259
did an improvement of its and made an

754
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,810
online test for it and we actually

755
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:54,250
implemented that one into the torque

756
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:56,950
smoke-free client so you can actually

757
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:59,080
see for this you know if there's the

758
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:02,919
service has this vulnerability there is

759
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:04,690
no practical attack on it yet I try to

760
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:08,350
look into it but that's too much or say

761
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:10,359
for me for be happy but we also have

762
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:14,890
this mode we call the brute-force mode

763
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:17,290
for response it means that all ms70 618

764
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:19,150
cards you have this application IDs but

765
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:21,369
you don't you always know where they are

766
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:23,260
but this one will brute force is it's

767
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:25,420
actually happy stolen for and lorries

768
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:26,779
are three idiots' repository I don't

769
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:28,519
know why I got that is

770
00:36:26,779 --> 00:36:31,010
but anyways from him anyway thank you so

771
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:31,419
much so we did that stuff that's very

772
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:33,950
funny

773
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:35,299
so you can get out very much more from

774
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:37,399
your visa cards when you do this and

775
00:36:35,299 --> 00:36:39,200
hook it up and yeah don't be afraid but

776
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,400
you know when you see something track to

777
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,169
you or something like that showing up in

778
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:47,599
the output you should be a little bit

779
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:50,390
afraid and hmm these you ID cards should

780
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:51,920
we talk about that no yeah okay let's go

781
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:53,450
through something real funny Aaron okay

782
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:57,010
one more card you want to have more and

783
00:36:53,450 --> 00:37:00,799
more cardio do you think it's boring you

784
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:03,710
so silent you said polite you want one

785
00:37:00,799 --> 00:37:06,440
more coroner why do you want it your

786
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:08,930
little ones yeah yeah you know yes what

787
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:10,910
seemed you and stuff anyway there's

788
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:12,799
another one of those travel cards this

789
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:16,399
is a travel card from a country I'm from

790
00:37:12,799 --> 00:37:18,349
and you know running the normal stuff it

791
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,150
says is the one-click card but here you

792
00:37:18,349 --> 00:37:22,069
see something that's very interesting it

793
00:37:20,150 --> 00:37:25,730
says the pianted detection is the hard

794
00:37:22,069 --> 00:37:28,940
this one is the new improved version of

795
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:32,420
my a classic versus retaliation for us

796
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:35,420
dogs are attacks and it was invulnerable

797
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:37,759
for a long time until the original guy

798
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:41,589
who did the original tech well released

799
00:37:37,759 --> 00:37:44,539
2015 release a new research paper called

800
00:37:41,589 --> 00:37:48,319
faulty imperative bloody babble added

801
00:37:44,539 --> 00:37:51,559
bloody and from that paper he described

802
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:52,940
a parity attack throughout finally

803
00:37:51,559 --> 00:37:56,509
certain coffee interview crypto one

804
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:59,960
crypto and that triggered some people on

805
00:37:56,509 --> 00:38:02,119
the forum some excellent C programmers

806
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:06,200
who learn some other enhanced attacks

807
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:08,450
before P V and another use it was hasn't

808
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,930
been online for a full time called blow

809
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:15,169
pose you don't hear it we know whether

810
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:17,419
we know about them and they made some

811
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:21,079
solvers for this hotness to attack and

812
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:22,880
it was amazing but it had it had some

813
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:24,740
downside took time it takes about forty

814
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:27,349
to fifty thousand ounces and two times

815
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:29,779
to run it and it's hard it's it's very

816
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:31,819
hard to run that attack then P we took

817
00:38:29,779 --> 00:38:34,759
one and a half years on him to make an

818
00:38:31,819 --> 00:38:38,029
improved version of this meanwhile

819
00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:40,160
another third user enter player free

820
00:38:38,030 --> 00:38:42,560
comes up and comes up with a bit slide

821
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:46,160
solver for this for krypter one attacks

822
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:48,070
and yes punish the the time it takes to

823
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:51,440
brute-force something

824
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:56,570
the thing with hard nested attacks which

825
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:59,750
is implemented in the MF in the box

826
00:38:56,570 --> 00:39:02,560
boobs proximal client it is that you can

827
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:05,210
only attack one sector at the time

828
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:08,630
because when you need to have an own key

829
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:11,060
since before and now this is strange and

830
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:14,840
this one when we come back to the F

831
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:17,810
check oops your honor why I will say

832
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:19,700
always go back to F check it's because

833
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:21,950
you need a you know you need a default

834
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,899
key to be able to run against it this

835
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:25,730
time I know because this is all known

836
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:28,460
key so we pretend we didn't see all of

837
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:34,340
the keys but it does have all the keys

838
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:36,080
already found this so yeah maybe

839
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:41,080
yes pretend that we didn't find these

840
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:47,960
ones okay I can show you this one off

841
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:50,330
MF hard sector of a and I want to target

842
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:54,110
one let's see I won't have a sector 60

843
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:56,120
Hey he'll be fit for them you run up and

844
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:58,600
it's optimized for different course of

845
00:39:56,120 --> 00:40:05,330
your CPUs it's even better on

846
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:07,339
high-powered CPUs and yeah it's time

847
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:11,930
ethically off yeah if you see this is C

848
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:14,030
yep sorry do that in the corner here you

849
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:17,839
see amount of announces it collects and

850
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:20,030
tries to do full attack and here's the

851
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:23,300
different bit flippin appearances on it

852
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:25,520
and it still runs now and an estimate

853
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:31,520
how long time it will take to to crack

854
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:37,400
whiskey but it keeps on running come on

855
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:40,730
give this yeah yeah you got the key down

856
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:43,700
there I will show like this it will be

857
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:46,640
easy so far Mikey straight off you can

858
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:48,799
compare it takes about normally about

859
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,560
the 24 seconds but some of these keys

860
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:53,170
are better

861
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:56,529
her ative fixing for it and it takes a

862
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:58,780
long time but it only needs 1600 nonces

863
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:00,460
to collect means it's very fast come on

864
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:02,200
to run in that sense compared to the

865
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:04,390
previous attacks of improvements of its

866
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:06,990
attacks it's like magnificent scale

867
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:11,950
something like amazing

868
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:13,750
so with this stuff you can run list yeah

869
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:14,379
we'll see this you see something else

870
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:21,370
oops

871
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:28,500
run run hard outer pool yeah no kinky

872
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:31,600
names that's wrong porn at all porn

873
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:33,010
yeah yeah you need to you know if you

874
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:36,910
want to do things like this you would

875
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:42,190
like to run do you want me to run this

876
00:41:36,910 --> 00:41:47,440
if you only continue okay yeah that's

877
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:49,090
fully sacred if you want this one you

878
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,880
want to you know this is what I call the

879
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:53,980
improve hardness that is ripped out upon

880
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:55,780
script which is if you run something

881
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:58,600
called my lace is my lacy cracker

882
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:02,770
remember that one who knows about that

883
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:04,259
one no there's a little two dots that's

884
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:07,509
right

885
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:09,280
anyway when you run this it tries to you

886
00:42:07,510 --> 00:42:11,380
know run this hotness to attack against

887
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:12,790
all sectors that needs to be found as

888
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:14,950
they're also tries to improve it by

889
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:16,840
doing some fast checks of key so it

890
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:20,169
doesn't have to repeat the final exactly

891
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:21,700
every block of it and when it runs this

892
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:23,380
will take about three minutes to run

893
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:25,149
says no not fancy but it will actually

894
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:27,880
us do that and we'll ask you do you want

895
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:31,320
me to save keys yes or no and if you

896
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:31,320
found all the keys you when we ask you

897
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:36,250
it will ask you about and if you want to

898
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:37,839
dump the car and yeah say yes

899
00:42:36,250 --> 00:42:40,120
pump you get are dumped and it also

900
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:42,280
would convert you get this by be narrow

901
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:44,080
file email file be Asian file and the

902
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:50,080
bandit actually transforms it into a

903
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:51,670
HTML file see your sets yeah yeah you

904
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:53,400
can really look at it nicely and

905
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:55,630
everything like that it's kind of fun

906
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:58,090
we've made a lot of optimizations of

907
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:59,530
that area yeah everything out making it

908
00:42:58,090 --> 00:43:02,550
a lot more user-friendly than what it

909
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:04,080
has been in the past yes

910
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:06,360
it's back to the thing it looks simple

911
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:09,180
but yeah it's because it took hours to

912
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:11,520
make it simple I like this stuff though

913
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:16,140
if you can run back you know yep yeah

914
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:17,550
yeah based on these attacks we need to

915
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:19,140
make a lot of assumptions that we need

916
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:21,630
to hope that a lot of things have been

917
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:24,690
set up in place to be able to carry out

918
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:26,880
these attacks successfully making use of

919
00:43:24,690 --> 00:43:29,880
a particular car technology type such as

920
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,500
this one here it's a lot better to fill

921
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,780
up every single sector every single

922
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,760
block with random keys rather than just

923
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:37,410
leaving any default key or the card that

924
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,870
makes it attack a lot harder to carry

925
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:41,370
out it's unfortunate that a lot of

926
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:44,339
distributors don't necessarily do that

927
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:46,380
so at least it leaves it open for a hard

928
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:59,970
nested like the one that we just carried

929
00:43:46,380 --> 00:44:01,380
out I mean

930
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:05,430
thank is running out and we'll come back

931
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:07,400
when it's finished he saw why you should

932
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:12,480
be here

933
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:24,630
right oh yeah proxmark you a you have

934
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:38,940
any questions come on just one more

935
00:44:24,630 --> 00:44:42,420
microphone for you hello hi this is rich

936
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:45,420
and I have a proximal three Hardy v3 and

937
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:46,349
it is a very resilient device multiple

938
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:49,020
times up you know

939
00:44:46,349 --> 00:44:51,300
first up firmware and it and I have been

940
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:52,619
able to revive that properly so I just

941
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,240
wanted to understand that are there any

942
00:44:52,619 --> 00:44:56,540
mitigations build for or are they any

943
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:59,129
checks and how resilient is the IDP for

944
00:44:56,540 --> 00:45:00,869
with respect to improper flashing or

945
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:03,180
breaking and if we can remove it

946
00:45:00,869 --> 00:45:07,109
properly do we have anything on that

947
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:10,649
part J tagging is the key to breaking

948
00:45:07,109 --> 00:45:13,170
yes essentially yeah after the problem

949
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:15,180
is that people will download from the

950
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:17,280
rock repo or don't necessarily

951
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:19,230
understand that you know they've

952
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,720
purchased a proxmark for one location

953
00:45:19,230 --> 00:45:23,220
tag or to another to get their binaries

954
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,399
that's where things sort of get a little

955
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:29,040
bit messed up the the only real solution

956
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:31,500
for for a brick proxmark is to go for

957
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:34,109
JTAG but we've solved most of those

958
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:36,780
issues we've provide the the processes

959
00:45:34,109 --> 00:45:38,069
for that the firmware flasher is a lot

960
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:40,470
more stable than what it ever has been

961
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:42,119
before it with the rav4

962
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:46,700
we're having trouble actually getting it

963
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:46,700
to tip over to be honest sir thank you

964
00:45:48,770 --> 00:45:53,970
okay so for the high frequency card you

965
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:56,760
have like you try to find out key and

966
00:45:53,970 --> 00:45:58,500
key be right if it's not ffff for

967
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,970
reading about the cars logo and you're

968
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:02,520
reading into high frequency my fare

969
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:04,560
cards you have to figure out the keys

970
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:06,270
before you clone it right yes you have

971
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:09,000
to have all the critical or grill keys

972
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:11,550
to be able to read out the card and then

973
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:13,380
it comes down to the idea of what does

974
00:46:11,550 --> 00:46:16,229
the valid reader system

975
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:18,420
RFID system would uses this card if they

976
00:46:16,229 --> 00:46:20,910
are checking things sometimes we want to

977
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:23,670
check the UID sometimes we read it off

978
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:26,519
the a key or sometimes we need the car

979
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:28,470
to be exactly the same so yeah that's a

980
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:31,529
give-and-take you know but normally you

981
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:33,538
will use the UID changeable cards in

982
00:46:31,529 --> 00:46:35,849
order to get something out of it

983
00:46:33,539 --> 00:46:37,619
speaking of which would be the fella so

984
00:46:35,849 --> 00:46:40,200
the keys lik when you're in the process

985
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:41,970
of finding it if if the card is not

986
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:43,950
using default keys do you brute forces

987
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:50,098
or you or I came across some algorithms

988
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:51,890
like Eames MFC UK and yeah Lib NFC yeah

989
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:55,619
yeah yeah mmm

990
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:57,479
EMF OC & MF you see yeah but that's

991
00:46:55,619 --> 00:47:00,479
actually what it's called dark Sider

992
00:46:57,479 --> 00:47:02,939
tank in the proxmark world and the

993
00:47:00,479 --> 00:47:05,879
nested attack is for men i think

994
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:10,049
is so it's the same attacks implemented

995
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:12,059
for the dog that attacked it is the text

996
00:47:10,049 --> 00:47:15,210
of a week card so you only it's a card

997
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:17,249
only attack for the hot nested which is

998
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:20,640
not properly implemented in there leave

999
00:47:17,249 --> 00:47:23,910
NFC right now there's some PRS for it

1000
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:25,558
you would need an own key and you can

1001
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:28,609
only get that two ways right now you can

1002
00:47:25,559 --> 00:47:31,410
sniff a traffic with proxmark or with I

1003
00:47:28,609 --> 00:47:34,049
think you can we relieve an MC yeah and

1004
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:38,279
you get the key then announces need for

1005
00:47:34,049 --> 00:47:40,559
that one or you have a default key okay

1006
00:47:38,279 --> 00:47:44,160
okay wait wait just give me two seconds

1007
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:47,029
then go back here all right one two

1008
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,029
three four five six

1009
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:53,729
yeah the script is finished so asked me

1010
00:47:50,309 --> 00:47:55,499
if you want to save keys yep sure and

1011
00:47:53,729 --> 00:47:57,629
they want to cyclists Thorin if yes M

1012
00:47:55,499 --> 00:47:59,930
press enter it takes a default name you

1013
00:47:57,630 --> 00:48:03,269
want to dump the card yeah sure do that

1014
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:05,009
how about that yeah no it's that's fast

1015
00:48:03,269 --> 00:48:06,238
so yeah keep on with customer yeah that

1016
00:48:05,009 --> 00:48:07,499
was that like I was just curious about

1017
00:48:06,239 --> 00:48:11,009
that I was trying to implement those

1018
00:48:07,499 --> 00:48:12,419
things using an Arduino and RC 522 app

1019
00:48:11,009 --> 00:48:14,729
done it'll a couple of years back and

1020
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:16,920
where I got stuck was I had default keys

1021
00:48:14,729 --> 00:48:19,169
and I could lick it using magic cards I

1022
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:21,719
could I could read and write and do you

1023
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:22,710
IDs but then the other blocks I was

1024
00:48:21,719 --> 00:48:24,180
struggling with it because other than

1025
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:25,589
default keys I didn't have it and I was

1026
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:27,839
trying to imply

1027
00:48:25,589 --> 00:48:30,328
it's a sniffing it sniffing the traffic

1028
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:34,020
is how you you know go forward if you

1029
00:48:30,329 --> 00:48:37,470
want to you know find more keys and yes

1030
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:41,069
some of the @xp family like the five to

1031
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:44,040
two at the 6-3 3-6 6-3 have what they

1032
00:48:41,069 --> 00:48:47,190
refer to as a rowboat this similar forty

1033
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:47,660
I as well tariffs and they allowed that

1034
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:53,490
as well

1035
00:48:47,660 --> 00:48:58,790
thank you we can take the questions or

1036
00:48:53,490 --> 00:48:58,790
plane please go and how short break

1037
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:05,590
sorry about that one

1038
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:05,590
[Applause]
