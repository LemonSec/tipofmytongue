1
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:07,550
thank you very much and thank you for

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:09,830
coming to my presentation

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:13,850
can you all hear me audios okay you can

4
00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:15,620
hear me excellent so today I would like

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,359
to talk about something that is not so

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,880
technical usually I do technical talks

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,250
but this clearly is a non-technical talk

8
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,869
but rather a experience based talk quick

9
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:26,330
word about myself my name is Mario I've

10
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:28,130
come from Germany in Berlin and I run a

11
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:29,630
company that is called queue 53 and we

12
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:31,759
basically do penetration tests and

13
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,289
source code audits and these things it's

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,640
a rather small company and I want to

15
00:00:33,289 --> 00:00:36,409
leave it as that for a variety of

16
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,170
reasons and some of these reasons you

17
00:00:36,409 --> 00:00:43,039
might actually talk about today um I

18
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:44,929
carry a PhD in computer sciences which I

19
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,579
got for looking very sternly at

20
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:48,019
cross-site scripting so yes you can have

21
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:50,569
a PhD in cross-site scripting I was

22
00:00:48,019 --> 00:00:53,299
surprised myself and I maintain a couple

23
00:00:50,569 --> 00:00:55,219
of libraries and open source tools wrote

24
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:58,309
a couple of papers wrote a couple of

25
00:00:55,219 --> 00:01:00,409
books and yeah pretty much

26
00:00:58,309 --> 00:01:04,610
most of it if not all of it you can find

27
00:01:00,409 --> 00:01:07,670
for free online so today we're gonna

28
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:09,110
talk about a experience that I made over

29
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,490
the past years because I want to talk

30
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:13,010
about how to create an information

31
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:14,630
security company what entitles me to do

32
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,280
so is the fact that I actually created

33
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,619
one myself twelve years ago and I'm

34
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,750
still running it and it's still going

35
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:22,460
however these are my experiences and it

36
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:25,610
might be that you have different

37
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:27,949
experiences so your mileage may vary and

38
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,660
it might be that certain details of this

39
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:31,910
talk simply do not apply to you I

40
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:33,920
apologize in advance but I also can't

41
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,600
really take all the feedback on that

42
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,420
because there are so many experiences

43
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,479
and eventually the slides would explode

44
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:44,180
so let's first see who is actually here

45
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,340
today who here is a penetration tester

46
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:49,070
please raise your hand all right that's

47
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,930
a good majority who here is a developer

48
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:53,990
or a defender of web applications yes

49
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:56,960
very nice who here is like from the

50
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:59,089
managerial area like ISO C so C SEO

51
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,899
these things okay thank you very much

52
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:04,640
and who here is a bug bounty hunter

53
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:06,050
almost no one said such interesting

54
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,750
thank you very much that gives me like a

55
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:10,459
good idea about the audience and what

56
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,740
kind of things to focus on during my

57
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:15,440
presentation so

58
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:17,450
let's first talk about how this talk is

59
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,620
actually being structured the first acts

60
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:20,600
that we're going to talk about is the

61
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,580
onboarding we're gonna be talking about

62
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,470
like why we want to create an intersect

63
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:26,750
company what the motivation might be

64
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:28,190
what early pitfalls might be and so on

65
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,960
then we gonna talk about building it and

66
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,130
getting it to run in the third act we're

67
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:32,840
going to talk about running the whole

68
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:34,070
thing and in the final act and I think

69
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,660
that's the most important one we're

70
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,130
going to talk about us about us humans

71
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,710
because we're going to talk about how to

72
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:41,660
do that whole thing and staying sane at

73
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:45,800
the same time because sometimes these

74
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:46,850
things can be very challenging so let's

75
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,800
get started and talk about the

76
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:51,350
onboarding how to get into the position

77
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,190
and raise enough motivation to X ability

78
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:57,560
on security company why this talk why

79
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:59,870
this motivation because why not I mean

80
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,910
building your own company is not

81
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:03,620
everybody's thing some people indeed

82
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:04,820
find employment more fulfilling they

83
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,470
want to have structure they want to go

84
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,209
to the office they won't off coworkers

85
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:09,620
and all these things they don't want to

86
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,150
build something they just want to enjoy

87
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:14,600
what other people built and that's fine

88
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:16,490
as well if you're of that kind then

89
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:18,320
probably this talk is not gonna be super

90
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,550
interesting for you because you have to

91
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,280
have a little bit of entrepreneurial

92
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:23,650
spirit to actually take benefits from

93
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:26,240
those slides in this presentation

94
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:28,760
however I also heard from a couple of

95
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:31,220
people who are employed that they don't

96
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,410
really love it too much they don't love

97
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,790
kind of reporting upwards they don't

98
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,500
love that they have to get up early in

99
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:38,150
the morning they don't love that they

100
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,670
have to wear pants when they work and

101
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:42,590
all these things seem to them like a

102
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:44,299
small jail and in addition to that they

103
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:46,370
might not even get a salary that makes

104
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,260
them happy so they complain it's like oh

105
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:50,290
how my job is and I'm gonna kind of

106
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:53,810
do something else but I do not know what

107
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:55,100
why complain when you can indeed kind of

108
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,540
press your teeth together and just

109
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:58,070
construct something build something

110
00:03:56,540 --> 00:04:00,380
build something new that is exactly as

111
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:02,540
you want it to be quite honest I was

112
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:04,040
that complainer a long time ago and at

113
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,060
some point I decided it's enough I don't

114
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,040
wanna do it anymore I want to build

115
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:11,660
something myself and I did it and then I

116
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,910
was happy information security companies

117
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,770
today have changed if you look at for

118
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:17,480
example the situation 15 years ago you

119
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:18,950
would find a lot of small checks a lot

120
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,380
of small companies and the whole sector

121
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:23,419
was just like still growing in all words

122
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,710
everything was coming together and today

123
00:04:23,419 --> 00:04:25,630
this is different let's look for example

124
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:28,120
just

125
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,710
an example I don't know ncc group I

126
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,750
think the response or similar condition

127
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,039
even bear of course and I don't want to

128
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:35,020
say anything bad I'm just want to use

129
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,840
them as an example of how these

130
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:39,549
companies have been developing over time

131
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,169
according to the internet and CC group

132
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:43,210
looks like this they have 35 offices

133
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:45,640
around the world or more meanwhile they

134
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,950
employ more than 2,000 people and are as

135
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,020
they claim a trusted adviser to 15,000

136
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,330
clients worldwide so it's a massive

137
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:53,799
cooperation and pretty much it's a

138
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,270
corporation like any other there's like

139
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,950
one huge template how you build like

140
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,150
these huge businesses and then you run

141
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,469
them and you make a lot of money and

142
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:03,010
there are shareholders and so on and so

143
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:05,260
now we know the deal I guess I think in

144
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,820
2006 they bought recall total nation

145
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,080
management and so on and so on they

146
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,730
bought source cybersecurity site

147
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,320
confidence escrow Europe AIESEC partners

148
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:13,450
and a lot of other companies so you can

149
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,550
see it's pretty much one huge business

150
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:17,650
that by smaller businesses and by that

151
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,480
it becomes bigger it doesn't kind of

152
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:20,979
feel like the typical information

153
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,020
security company with a bunch of hackers

154
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,030
that take apart web applications mobile

155
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:27,460
applications and the likes it's a

156
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:31,140
corporation a behemoth so to say and

157
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:33,580
that's fine so oftentimes people think

158
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:36,460
that information security companies look

159
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,450
like this who knows the movie very good

160
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,299
very good very good

161
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:41,440
but a first year that's not reality

162
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,070
because what information security

163
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:46,510
companies usually look like is this and

164
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,820
that's fine but that's not what

165
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:50,860
everybody wants I mean you see there's

166
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:52,150
like a lot of diversity and all of them

167
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,820
have like almost the similar hair but

168
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:56,229
anyway this is what those probably's

169
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:58,150
usually look like or what their rule

170
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,290
prefers like a port room and a couple of

171
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,090
old guys in there and they manage

172
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:03,070
everything fair enough

173
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:04,599
but this is not the kind of company we

174
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,370
actually want to talk about today

175
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,810
because that's boring and people have

176
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:09,550
been talking about this for ages and

177
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,630
ages and ages and we're probably not

178
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:13,030
really interested in building one of

179
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:15,550
these behemoths what we want to talk

180
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:18,489
about what we're aiming to build is a

181
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:21,280
boutique what it would take like a small

182
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:23,680
company that wants to stay small that

183
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,299
focuses on quality only that focuses on

184
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,580
having happy employees or happy team

185
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:29,530
members and doesn't really grow beyond

186
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,169
the size of five to twenty people maybe

187
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:34,330
twenty-five but rarely more than 50

188
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:36,760
which is team focused and transit area

189
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:38,320
instead of data driven something like a

190
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,680
couple of other companies that I know in

191
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,110
German

192
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:43,479
we work together with Ricky labs for

193
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:46,000
example that was created by FX or

194
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:47,469
enabled security or x1d SEC which is

195
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,470
also a tiny company but they're amazing

196
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:52,449
and they produce amazing work because

197
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,590
they have experts and only experts and

198
00:06:52,449 --> 00:06:55,030
there's a couple of other ones out there

199
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:59,799
of course and some of them are even

200
00:06:55,030 --> 00:07:01,809
though here so again why when you do

201
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,400
this talk why do we want to kind of talk

202
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:07,120
about how to build one of these

203
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:09,159
boutiques because while large

204
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,410
corporations exist and they have a

205
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,389
purpose because large companies can

206
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:15,099
build large things not everything is

207
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:16,720
always great with them and I had the

208
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:18,909
feeling as well when I was in the

209
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:24,520
situation and working off with one of

210
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:26,229
these or several of these oftentimes we

211
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,789
people say bigger is better but bigger

212
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:30,219
is not necessarily better bigger is just

213
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:31,780
bigger and that means that things take

214
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,660
more time you have long and

215
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:36,580
administratively heavy processes there's

216
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,139
lots of people involved in the business

217
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:40,300
that don't even know the field I could

218
00:07:38,139 --> 00:07:42,190
well good story so like a friend of mine

219
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,440
asked me to kind of get like a quote for

220
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:45,849
a source code scanning of a website and

221
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,400
he didn't do it himself because he owns

222
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:50,229
such company and then he tasks me or

223
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,330
asked me if I could kind of claim that

224
00:07:50,229 --> 00:07:54,729
I'm someone who has a website that was

225
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,500
to be scanned so if I could please just

226
00:07:54,729 --> 00:07:57,940
call one of these companies I don't look

227
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,530
gonna say the name and get like a quote

228
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,360
for them because he was eager to learn

229
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:03,070
how expensive they are what they

230
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,530
actually doing it I did this so I did

231
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:06,880
like a fake call and called this company

232
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:10,169
I wanted to find out how much would it

233
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:12,669
cost if they scan and test against our

234
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:15,159
made-up website just to get ideas about

235
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:17,440
the pricing and I called them and I had

236
00:08:15,159 --> 00:08:19,780
some guy on the phone and he asked me a

237
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,849
couple of questions what we're doing and

238
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:22,960
how big the website is and if you can

239
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:25,509
have a look at this thing and everything

240
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,940
was fine and then he asked me look what

241
00:08:25,509 --> 00:08:31,270
kind of programming language is the

242
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:34,958
website written in and I said PHP and he

243
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:39,130
said like ah pap ok noting that downs

244
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:43,299
like what you have never had such call

245
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:44,649
before obviously because you don't even

246
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:45,819
know the programming languages I mean

247
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:48,310
that it's like you don't ask the

248
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:49,450
question when the answer confuses you or

249
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,750
you have no idea would it put to

250
00:08:49,450 --> 00:08:53,360
intentionally be and Yoram bear

251
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:54,800
yourself by saying pap or is there a

252
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,420
programming language that is called pap

253
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,150
I dunno maybe maybe there is one and I'm

254
00:08:56,420 --> 00:09:00,290
the idiot who knows anyway lots of

255
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:02,180
people involved who don't really know

256
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:03,890
the field there's often times very

257
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:05,359
expensive contracts like we had

258
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,220
situations where we were competing with

259
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,990
a couple of different vendors and the

260
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:11,180
larger ones oftentimes submitted a

261
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:13,250
quotation there was 20 times the money

262
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,380
that we asked for 20 times factor 20

263
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:16,580
that is incredible

264
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:18,380
so sometimes they get the feeling and

265
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:19,550
maybe I'm wrong probably I'm wrong but

266
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,140
sometimes I get the feeling that the

267
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,790
bigger the company is that what you get

268
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:25,100
is effectively security for the big and

269
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:26,599
for the rich but who takes care of the

270
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,370
smaller companies who test them or

271
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,140
activists and so on that also needs

272
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:32,810
security of open-source developers who

273
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:35,660
helps them the huge months maybe not

274
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:37,489
always another disadvantage might as

275
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,660
well be that it's unclear if the testers

276
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:40,250
that are actually testing your

277
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:42,319
application afterwards are really

278
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:44,960
skilled enough to do so because maybe

279
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,640
they don't really know their stuff maybe

280
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,830
they have been put on the wrong project

281
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:50,270
rarely do you have transparency in these

282
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:52,520
situations who is actually testing your

283
00:09:50,270 --> 00:09:54,230
application in a small company that

284
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,689
might not be the case because this third

285
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:58,910
person might as well be there oftentimes

286
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:01,010
you get very generic reports with lots

287
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,600
of useless texts and pie charts and all

288
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,490
sorts of diagrams that no one wants to

289
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:06,560
see that don't matter at all like we've

290
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:09,080
seen sample reports and demo reports of

291
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,339
other companies with bugs in there that

292
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,830
don't even exist anymore

293
00:10:10,339 --> 00:10:14,390
stuff like cross-site tracing Omega

294
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:16,190
cross the trait that doesn't matter

295
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:18,230
anymore this pack class died 15 years

296
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:19,520
ago you don't have to have a ticket in

297
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,410
your report that complaints about

298
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,390
cross-site tracing this is gone this is

299
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:26,089
over yet it's in there just to generate

300
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:27,650
more mass and it oftentimes feels that

301
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:29,150
financial growth is the most important

302
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:30,410
thing because you need to stake you need

303
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:32,150
to keep the stake in the shareholders

304
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:35,630
happy so this is the priority number one

305
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:37,339
not quality but money yet some people

306
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:38,630
just don't want to do this and at some

307
00:10:37,339 --> 00:10:40,580
times they have the feeling and again I

308
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:42,110
might be wrong that with these contracts

309
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,970
you might not get enough bang for the

310
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,339
buck and that is sad because for some

311
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:47,780
people money is a scarce resource and

312
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:49,820
they want to choose wisely

313
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:52,189
and cautiously whom did she work with to

314
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,630
get the results that they need what use

315
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:56,380
is the penetration test that doesn't

316
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:59,300
have good coverage none at all

317
00:10:56,380 --> 00:11:01,370
I'm not saying that all that all these

318
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,140
things must necessarily be better in a

319
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,440
boutique and the small company has

320
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,780
mentioned 5 to 20 people

321
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:08,280
not necessarily but things can be better

322
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,050
for all of our parties because

323
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:12,660
oftentimes there's more control for

324
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:14,870
everybody involved more transparency not

325
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:17,900
so many hierarchy layers and so on

326
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:20,700
smaller sometimes also means it's faster

327
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:23,550
it is possible to have very short and

328
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:25,560
very economic processes because there is

329
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:26,969
no long communication chains there is

330
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,530
just like two or three people that the

331
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:32,880
client will ever deal with and that is

332
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:34,860
fine sorry oftentimes all the involve

333
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,200
people both in the company and the

334
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,600
specific test are experts and the client

335
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,610
can see who they are and can check them

336
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,290
and learn about them and see oh this

337
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,640
person gave a conference talk and this

338
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,689
person's like really good and this and

339
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,010
this and that so that makes me feel

340
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:50,130
better because I know that the right

341
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:52,080
people are testing my thing given that

342
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:54,689
all those administrative processes don't

343
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:57,210
exist and you necessarily don't have a

344
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:59,880
for example huge building with flags in

345
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:02,070
front and tons of cars and whatnot you

346
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:04,439
can ask for cheaper prices the contracts

347
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:06,480
can be much cheaper don't have to be but

348
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:08,390
they can as mentioned earlier we've seen

349
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:12,090
pricing differences for the same scope

350
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:14,850
with petrol 20 we offered 60k another

351
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:19,650
company offered 1.2 million where does

352
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:21,690
all the money go i wondering oftentimes

353
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,920
clients want to have individualized

354
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,750
services they want to have

355
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,430
individualized reports special formats

356
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:28,050
they have special needs that come back

357
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,699
after the test one something again and

358
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:31,199
that is in my opinion also often times

359
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:33,690
easier to handle with a small company

360
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,700
because otherwise huge behemoth must be

361
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:37,380
turned on again and the whole process

362
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,700
needs to be rolling again and I'm not

363
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:40,260
even sure if that's possible in a large

364
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:43,260
company to do this maybe it is but maybe

365
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:45,090
not and I often feel that those small

366
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,500
companies have different focus they not

367
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:47,550
necessarily have the focus of making

368
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,930
more money because money is not

369
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:51,030
everything but they rather seem to have

370
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:52,500
the focus of valuing ethics and

371
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:55,949
sustainability over growth and financial

372
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,960
gain I would go as far and say that in

373
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:59,730
the information security business it's

374
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:02,220
very unlikely that you end up poor

375
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:05,250
because the services that we charge for

376
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:08,460
are usually quite expensive often times

377
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:10,770
too expensive but if financial growth is

378
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:12,390
not your goal that's not a problem

379
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:14,760
because you're gonna get rich anyway as

380
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:15,990
stupid as that may sound and often times

381
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,350
they have the feeling that we'll smaller

382
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,000
companies you will

383
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:20,380
much more bang for the buck and that's a

384
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,780
good thing for everybody you feel better

385
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:23,950
about your services the client feels

386
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,300
better about what they get they

387
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:29,290
recommend you there's word-of-mouth and

388
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:30,939
so on if done right I mean of course you

389
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,770
can still screw it up or someone else

390
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,540
whom you partner with and build the

391
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,610
company with can screw that up so the

392
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:38,349
question is how to do that right and as

393
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:40,060
mentioned this is just like my account

394
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:41,860
on things and it might be terrifyingly

395
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,000
wrong but let's see maybe there is

396
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,680
something in there that you can actually

397
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,360
use and that benefits you and your own

398
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:50,260
endeavors because that's the purpose of

399
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:54,970
this presentation building it act number

400
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:57,400
two the bootstrapping phase is pretty

401
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:58,570
much the first thing that needs to be

402
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,400
there you need to kind of have the

403
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:03,370
motivation to build your own security

404
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:05,290
company you have to really want to build

405
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,820
it and you need to know why you want to

406
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:08,620
do that what your goal is maybe you want

407
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,210
to sell exploits maybe you indeed want

408
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:11,710
to grow a company and sell it later on

409
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,940
or maybe it's just gonna be your brain

410
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:14,440
site or your baby and you're gonna kind

411
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:16,240
of maintain it as long as you can and

412
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,400
run with it because it's actually tons

413
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,690
of fun I'm going with a ladder like my

414
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:21,400
company I really like because it's

415
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:23,170
really fun and we have just 20 people

416
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,470
and I want to keep it like that and I

417
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:28,180
don't wanna sell it never why would i

418
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,920
for how you build it then afterwards I

419
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:31,750
think it's of secondary importance most

420
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,650
important is that you know what you want

421
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,600
and that your heart is in the right

422
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:36,520
place and that you're acting with the

423
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:41,110
right people for this and then just like

424
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:42,970
pull it off in my opinion you need to

425
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:45,190
make a decision about the posture of

426
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:47,800
your company so you want to wear a suit

427
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:49,750
or do you wanna wear wellies do you want

428
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,280
to create a template company or do you

429
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,470
want to create a michelin-star

430
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,209
restaurant with actual fine dining pen

431
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,410
tests that are so good that people will

432
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:58,090
definitely always come to you because

433
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:00,250
they know what they get do you been an

434
00:14:58,090 --> 00:15:01,510
exit or do we need keeper and run with a

435
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:02,140
company for as long as you can because

436
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:04,030
you love it

437
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,230
where interests and ethically what is

438
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:06,670
the goal of the whole operation

439
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:09,450
once you're clear on that you're pretty

440
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:10,990
much equipped already in hand start

441
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:13,600
we're gonna talk

442
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:15,370
needless to say about the keeper this is

443
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,450
the goal this is what I want to show in

444
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,650
this particular presentation I don't

445
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:19,240
want to tell you how to build a company

446
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:20,740
that you sell in two years I don't want

447
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,910
to tell you I do want to tell you how to

448
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,390
build a company that you keep for as

449
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:25,959
long as you can

450
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,490
the first thing

451
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,140
when building the whole thing up it

452
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:30,850
sounds easy but probably the hardest

453
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,380
part is to grow a name people need to

454
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:33,820
recognize you people need to see you

455
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:35,860
people need to learn that you're now on

456
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:39,280
the market that you're good that you

457
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:42,850
have expertise and that you are the

458
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:44,829
right one for them to work with it's

459
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:47,290
actually not that super hard because

460
00:15:44,830 --> 00:15:49,060
right now we have the situation where

461
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:51,370
everybody can submit conference talks

462
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:52,780
submit research work with bug bounty

463
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:55,270
programs get in touch with other people

464
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:56,770
network use Twitter your social networks

465
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:58,180
and all these things to kind of make

466
00:15:56,770 --> 00:16:00,250
sure that they get recognized that they

467
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,650
get seen and getting seen is the most

468
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:05,290
important thing publish posts partake in

469
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:06,790
discussions if for example Gareth

470
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:08,439
follows you and Twitter Gareth face from

471
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:09,910
the UK then you know already that you

472
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,170
came quite far because he follows you

473
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:12,910
people oh these those that are relevant

474
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:15,370
so that's already kind of pointing you

475
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:17,439
in the direction that something is being

476
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:19,120
done right but you doesn't have to be

477
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,140
just Gareth but you know if industry

478
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,580
leaders that you know and that you

479
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:23,439
respect kind of look at you and see you

480
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,730
then you have made the first step in the

481
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,320
right direction which is good

482
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:28,480
write a lot of papers if you have the

483
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,280
chance publish find new box back classes

484
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,840
win hacking challenges get seen engage

485
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:35,050
with others partner as much as you can

486
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,920
speak start small don't grow too fast or

487
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,839
do this too quickly

488
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,520
don't let this go over your head but

489
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,050
slowly build your way up until you're at

490
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:43,449
the point of people actually knowing you

491
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:46,569
and then you're already half done like

492
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:49,000
this is pretty much half the battle then

493
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,380
go and reduce your business maybe you do

494
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,580
this before maybe you do this afterwards

495
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,050
but basically you need to go and

496
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:55,660
register it somewhere I don't really

497
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:57,640
know how it works here in India I do

498
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,650
know how it works in Germany and it's

499
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,270
not that hard maybe here it's harder

500
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:02,920
maybe it's not I can't really tell

501
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:04,540
because I'm not an expert for that but

502
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,879
I'm pretty sure that most of the people

503
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:08,409
here most of you know where at least to

504
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,450
go to and to ask these questions and

505
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:13,180
then Ramon learn more about how to do

506
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:14,319
the registration process and then

507
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,209
oftentimes the question is like what

508
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,429
kind of company do you want to create is

509
00:17:16,209 --> 00:17:20,589
it like for example a huge one with

510
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:22,270
shares and stocks or is a big small one

511
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:24,129
or you want to be a freelancer first or

512
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:25,869
a team of freelancers that's your choice

513
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:27,820
and I always recommend to take the lean

514
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:29,679
approach and always start small and then

515
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:31,600
grow organically grow slowly but grow

516
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:35,470
steadily and that's the most important

517
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:38,320
thing so now we are already a tag 3

518
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:38,780
running the whole thing because once you

519
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,280
did all

520
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:41,629
once you are successful and once you

521
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,510
have the first clients in the extra like

522
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:46,580
you um then you get a good feeling you

523
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:49,430
know you did go into the right direction

524
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:51,250
so the first client is pretty much the

525
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:53,810
most important thing that you can have I

526
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:56,180
was very lucky with my first client

527
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:58,460
because it was a very large company from

528
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,880
the US who tends to build operating

529
00:17:58,460 --> 00:18:02,930
systems and create amazing browsers and

530
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,180
you can kind of guess who that was but

531
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:06,890
that was amazing because we had a client

532
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:09,110
that actually supported us to the first

533
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:10,220
hard weeks and months and basically says

534
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:12,350
like we're always gonna have work for

535
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:14,240
you in some way and this is the client

536
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:16,219
that you want be friends with the client

537
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,720
be nice with the client make sure that

538
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:19,520
they don't drop you because the first

539
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,370
client is the most important thing and

540
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,330
you don't wanna get rid of them

541
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:25,550
ideally find someone that you already

542
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:26,840
know from like earlier experience from

543
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:28,610
your old job or something like this

544
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,080
maybe from back bounty programs or

545
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,969
someone that you already are in touch

546
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,409
with so they know who you are and you

547
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:35,210
know how they are because then the

548
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:37,840
communications and the whole process and

549
00:18:35,210 --> 00:18:41,090
the whole flow is much much easier

550
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,620
sometimes there's weird ways of finding

551
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:44,330
your first client or finding clients in

552
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:45,949
general sometimes it's just like binge

553
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:47,449
drinking with them in the evening at a

554
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:48,890
conference in the next morning you have

555
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:50,060
a contract or a meeting or a briefing

556
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:52,460
call or something like this who knows

557
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:55,070
everything is possible don't exclude the

558
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,390
possibility of a weird approach just

559
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,800
because it's weird because it might

560
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:59,510
become your best client whatsoever

561
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,370
sometimes you receive an email that

562
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:02,690
email really sounds weird at first and

563
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,070
you read it once and twice is like I

564
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:05,210
shouldn't really respond to that but

565
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:07,129
then you do that and it turns out it's

566
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:09,440
the best client after all that happens

567
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:14,660
don't slam those doors be open as open

568
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:17,000
as you can then the boring stuff comes

569
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:19,730
because then you need to kind of get

570
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,470
organized and getting organized is the

571
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:23,330
most important thing you need to be able

572
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:26,810
to organize yourself and that is

573
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:28,310
sometimes so so hard when we started

574
00:19:26,810 --> 00:19:30,139
with quite early on what we do what

575
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:31,490
really were great for us was that we

576
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:33,950
made a decision for like an online

577
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:36,320
office solution you could go with office

578
00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:38,240
365 or with Google Docs or Google Drive

579
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,320
or whatever is out there but you need to

580
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,240
have something that is actually

581
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,550
supporting you a tool that helps you and

582
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:45,170
a tool that you can use for the next

583
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:47,120
years because migrating from one

584
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:48,200
solution to the other that sucks a lot

585
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,709
you never want to do that there's

586
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:51,809
definitely gonna be it for me

587
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:53,760
so choose wisely what tool you're gonna

588
00:19:51,809 --> 00:19:55,529
use and then stick with it go with what

589
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,629
you hate the least I looked at a couple

590
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:58,980
of one and one of them I hated the least

591
00:19:57,630 --> 00:20:01,380
so I went with it and we're quite happy

592
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,059
with it better don't go with a niche

593
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:05,549
product because the company might could

594
00:20:03,059 --> 00:20:07,200
just go bankrupt and then what so better

595
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:08,549
go is something that is like big that is

596
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,700
on the market already that is here to

597
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:13,200
stay for the next years and also have an

598
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,970
eye on what your clients are likely to

599
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,419
use the majority of our clients use

600
00:20:14,970 --> 00:20:19,710
Google Drive and they use slack so we

601
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:21,600
use Google Drive and we use slack

602
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,789
because then we have a shared interface

603
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,469
we can share documents with them quite

604
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:27,690
easily and they can share stuff with us

605
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:30,000
we can invite them into our slack or

606
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:31,350
they can invite us into their slack and

607
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,880
we can chat all the time during the pen

608
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:34,620
test which is amazing experience I

609
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,169
always chat with them obviously as close

610
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,489
as possible during the assessment what

611
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:40,500
is mentioned you manage my very maybe

612
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:42,690
here or somewhere else people use

613
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,639
different software and then you need to

614
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:46,559
decide go with the one that you hate the

615
00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:47,939
least and ideally find something that

616
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,260
your clients use as well because then

617
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:53,250
you're already on the same paper on the

618
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:55,919
safe side tools there's a lot of tools

619
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:58,230
you can use and there is actually more

620
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,669
tools that you can use that should be

621
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:01,139
there because most of them are too

622
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:03,450
specific and the company might go

623
00:21:01,139 --> 00:21:06,000
bankrupt as mentioned and they are not

624
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:07,679
really useful in the long run so find

625
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,630
the tools that you use that you need

626
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:11,940
should be productive but don't overdo it

627
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:13,409
don't have like three different calendar

628
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,799
applications at the same time go with

629
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:18,419
one what I use for myself and I'm kind

630
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,590
of trying to use the minimal approaches

631
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:20,880
I use a calendar

632
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,529
I mean I'm using the hell out of that

633
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,720
calendar and everything is done by the

634
00:21:22,529 --> 00:21:26,940
scheduler this is my my anchor my most

635
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,620
important tool the calendar I can share

636
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,000
with others but it's very very simple

637
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,928
just one through the pretty much does

638
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,880
all the heavy lifting

639
00:21:30,929 --> 00:21:34,470
then another tool that I have is like

640
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,720
this little to-do list next to the

641
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:38,669
calendar very very minimal this thing

642
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,110
tells me what to do today and the rest

643
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:42,380
of the calendar tells me what to do this

644
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:44,760
week next week and in the coming months

645
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:46,799
manage your documents will make sure

646
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:48,658
that processes that are repetitious that

647
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,549
are being templated by you create

648
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:53,039
document templates manage your documents

649
00:21:50,549 --> 00:21:55,320
be sure that you find what is needed to

650
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:56,820
be found and do link kind of organize

651
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,830
your file system in a way that it helps

652
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:00,570
you so basically the tools are there to

653
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:01,919
help you and you to force them into a

654
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,689
state that they actually do the

655
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,860
and that they ease your life and don't

656
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,540
force you to do things all the time

657
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,889
updates here and updates there and so on

658
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:09,149
and the most important thing with

659
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:11,130
getting organized and that's the very

660
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:13,110
much most important thing is everything

661
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:15,000
that you do and everything that you

662
00:22:13,110 --> 00:22:17,100
learn and everything that you talk about

663
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,780
with your clients over the over the

664
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:22,139
phone or over a Skype session and these

665
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:24,330
things always write it down always put

666
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:26,520
it into writing and then confirm it with

667
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:28,439
a client that this is indeed what you

668
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:30,570
talked about we had so many situations

669
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,730
where we had a call with the client and

670
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:35,129
we agreed on something via voice and

671
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:37,440
then we didn't confirm with them that

672
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:39,240
indeed that was the thing we talked

673
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,950
about that was the amount of person days

674
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:42,750
that was the daily rates and so on and

675
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:44,010
then the abuse sentences like no and the

676
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,240
call you said something different this

677
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,470
was three weeks ago it's like no I

678
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,140
didn't I didn't say anything different

679
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:51,210
oh we heard it exactly so they kind of

680
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,770
altered the truth afterwards and that is

681
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:54,600
something that you need to avoid at all

682
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:56,190
cost that's part of getting organized

683
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:58,409
write down what you agreed on in the

684
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:59,880
phone call send them an email have them

685
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:01,050
confirm that this is accurate and then

686
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,870
you have it in writing and nothing can

687
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:06,389
happen and you're in the safe so this

688
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:08,580
often takes time and practice like one

689
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:10,230
doesn't get organized quickly if one

690
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:13,110
wasn't organized before believe me it

691
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:15,510
took me some time years actually but at

692
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:17,909
some point you'll notice that you are in

693
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:19,920
this particular state page and then you

694
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:21,570
actually can work fluently and don't

695
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,470
have any road bumps and hiccups anymore

696
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:24,149
because everything comes together

697
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:26,690
automatically and that's the state you

698
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:29,760
want to reach start as early as possible

699
00:23:26,690 --> 00:23:31,290
my baby brother once said oh I'm a

700
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,760
student no but I don't need a calendar I

701
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:35,010
keep all that stuff in my hands like

702
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,270
dude absolutely not you will lead the

703
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:40,170
calendar start early

704
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:42,450
olav uses the calendar so there was

705
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:43,440
actually it's absolutely impossible to

706
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,630
keep all the things in your head

707
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,520
sometimes people pride themselves with

708
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:49,500
having everything in their head but that

709
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:51,060
is not a viable solution believe me at

710
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,650
some point it's gonna overflow you will

711
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:57,840
now have no chance to remember all these

712
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:59,640
things well as mentioned don't overdo it

713
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,919
with the tools there's like so many

714
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,420
shitty to us that nobody needs so make a

715
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:06,540
wise decision check what you actually

716
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:08,280
need keep it minimal use like three or

717
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,050
four or maybe five tools to get yourself

718
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,180
organized because that's usually enough

719
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:13,850
maybe you need a plugin or an extension

720
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,620
or something like this but may

721
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:17,629
sure that the whole thing is lean

722
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,189
because otherwise the tools are gonna

723
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:20,750
pretty much drown you in their features

724
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:22,669
and then you don't take any benefits

725
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:25,809
from them at all keep it lean that's

726
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:28,490
like the most important approach here

727
00:24:25,809 --> 00:24:30,440
one thing that is like a personal tool

728
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:32,090
for myself and I started doing that

729
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,280
round about six to seven years ago Liz

730
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:36,409
working with mailbox zero who here works

731
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:39,399
with mailbox zero or knows what I mean

732
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:43,370
with that few people it's good good

733
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:45,830
mailbox zero means that at the end of

734
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:47,809
the day you pretty much have zero mails

735
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:51,408
and your inbox everything that had to be

736
00:24:47,809 --> 00:24:52,970
done was done you receive an email you

737
00:24:51,409 --> 00:24:55,370
check what's in that email you'll

738
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:58,669
respond and then you archive it so it's

739
00:24:55,370 --> 00:25:00,500
gone and if something then happens or

740
00:24:58,669 --> 00:25:01,909
someone responds back to you then it

741
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,470
will pop pop pop up again and you will

742
00:25:01,909 --> 00:25:05,510
be seeing it again and you will be in

743
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:07,250
the position again of making like an

744
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:08,840
actionable tasks out of that but the

745
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:10,309
worst mistake that people are doing is

746
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,080
having like this huge overflowing

747
00:25:10,309 --> 00:25:14,629
mailboxes and they have no clue what is

748
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:16,399
going on and I can identify meanwhile

749
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:17,720
people who do that because that's the

750
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,400
people that you write an email and

751
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:20,990
nothing comes back and then you remind

752
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,789
them and nothing comes back and then

753
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:24,650
remind them again for example via a

754
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:26,419
signal or with a call it's like dude

755
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:28,580
where's the scope information it's like

756
00:25:26,419 --> 00:25:30,260
oh yeah over so that email sorry I know

757
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:31,970
already okay this person does not use

758
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,980
mailbox zero and that is problematic

759
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:36,409
because then important information gets

760
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,940
overseen so doing this following this

761
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:39,620
pattern or following this approach in my

762
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:42,289
opinion is a massive game-changer in

763
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:45,500
terms of getting organized you responded

764
00:25:42,289 --> 00:25:46,879
your task is done the ball is in the

765
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,530
corner of the client or wherever you

766
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,730
talk to archive it make sure it's

767
00:25:48,530 --> 00:25:52,100
invisible that you can't see it anymore

768
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:53,659
so doesn't distract you no time to

769
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:55,760
respond which is another small trick

770
00:25:53,659 --> 00:25:56,929
respond with the question so like I'm

771
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,669
not really sure what you meant you could

772
00:25:56,929 --> 00:26:00,320
you elaborate please archive it be done

773
00:25:58,669 --> 00:26:01,820
have it soft because then they will take

774
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,620
some time and get back to you and maybe

775
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:04,668
when they do then you will have time

776
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:06,620
again to actually work on this

777
00:26:04,669 --> 00:26:07,909
particular task make sure that there is

778
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,889
nothing in your view in your mailbox

779
00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:12,559
that distracts you too much keep it

780
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:14,210
organized keep the volume low make sure

781
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,559
you have mailbox zero I can really just

782
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,760
encourage you to do this because it's an

783
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:18,260
amazing helper and once you're there

784
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:21,610
once you actually reach that stage

785
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:21,610
that's the top feeling

786
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:27,800
my approach is you Ravidas when it goes

787
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:30,169
towards six o'clock in the evening I

788
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:32,240
work towards everything inbox empty and

789
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:33,770
I know that this is usually not

790
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,140
successful because we have lots of

791
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:38,750
clients of different time zones so when

792
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:41,180
I start working they just get up and

793
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:42,890
then I get tempted like it's seven

794
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:45,140
o'clock or an ale o'clock nothing like

795
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:46,910
hmm I could maybe have another look at

796
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:48,350
my mailbox that see or no there's like

797
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:50,210
five new mails and then you're back in

798
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:51,409
work mode don't do that because in the

799
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,730
end if you do this and if you keep doing

800
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:54,260
this if you don't respect the fact that

801
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:56,300
people will write you at all times

802
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:58,310
during the day a because of time zones

803
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:00,110
be because they're crazy then you will

804
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:01,940
go crazy as well and you might indeed

805
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:03,139
fall prone to the risk of burning out

806
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:04,220
because you will never really stop

807
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,170
working and you shouldn't do this you

808
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:08,120
should set like a line you look pretty

809
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:09,800
much set like a threshold and then from

810
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,000
this moment on I'm not checking emails

811
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,560
anymore I know that there's like ten

812
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,630
more but I don't care because my workday

813
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:16,280
is over check out the next morning with

814
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:17,450
a fresh eye and it's better for you and

815
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,879
it's even better for the client because

816
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:21,770
you delivered better quality and you

817
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:26,240
don't hastily respond and give them the

818
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:28,310
feeling that they're not important once

819
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,560
you mastered mailbox zero and once you

820
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:32,060
mastered getting organized and have a

821
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:34,129
good feeling about the things that you

822
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:36,139
do that you don't really you know you

823
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:37,490
kind of noticed in the situation when it

824
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,740
actually takes place that you are there

825
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:41,780
then you can take on bigger dragons and

826
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:43,250
take on bigger projects and it's

827
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:45,230
mentioned this might take years to get

828
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:49,700
there but it's worth the work and I can

829
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:50,960
only but recommend to go there another

830
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,730
thing that you definitely need to tackle

831
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,180
which is a bit harder is your own

832
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:58,760
security you're a security company so

833
00:27:56,180 --> 00:28:00,560
you need to be secure as well your

834
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,270
website needs to be secure and your

835
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,830
document store needs to be secure and

836
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:06,080
your co-workers and your team needs to

837
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:07,490
be properly secured and for that I think

838
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,560
it's important that you know your own

839
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:11,810
threat model and I often talk to people

840
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:13,490
who select yeah I have like cubes or as

841
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:15,350
running on my laptop and I spend like

842
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:18,550
five days of setting it up and now I'm

843
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:23,439
like safe from the NSA it's like man and

844
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:25,810
you're not part of the groups of people

845
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:27,850
that the NSA would monitor they don't

846
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:29,889
care about you you find web backs or

847
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:32,080
server parts and these things stuff with

848
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:34,660
like a small or low half left they don't

849
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:37,899
care about you the NSA or whatever

850
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:40,090
agency shouldn't be in your threat model

851
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:41,650
because they attack other people like

852
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:44,709
you don't have enough candy for them to

853
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:46,420
even notice you so don't have a threat

854
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:48,430
model that forces you to be overly

855
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:50,590
paranoid and spent your entire T of time

856
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:52,030
with hardening your posture because if

857
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:54,790
you go to that point you will eventually

858
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:57,129
realize the perfect security will kill

859
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:58,600
productivity because then you start

860
00:28:57,130 --> 00:29:00,520
thinking about this and that in taking

861
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:02,530
and paranoid approach and this will

862
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:04,870
consume so much time that you can't use

863
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:07,030
for doing a Shi useful things so try to

864
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:08,469
find like a good balance my good balance

865
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:10,300
for example is I know that I'm running

866
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:11,740
and I'm running limits and I know that

867
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,330
it's not optimal I'm running Ubuntu as

868
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,950
an operating system I know that it's not

869
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:16,449
great like there is definitely security

870
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:19,120
shortcomings in this operating system

871
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:21,070
I could also run Windows 10 and it would

872
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,290
also be security shortcomings or privacy

873
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:25,480
shortcomings here and there but I don't

874
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:28,090
care too much because in my threat model

875
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:30,370
and actually quite fine because lastly

876
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:33,129
the information that we sit on is box

877
00:29:30,370 --> 00:29:34,689
that are about to get fixed and I rather

878
00:29:33,130 --> 00:29:38,110
want to be a bit more productive and

879
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:40,660
overly paranoid one thing however that

880
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:44,830
you need to consider is not an external

881
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:46,540
attacker but the chaos monkey something

882
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:48,939
that kind of precious in your computer

883
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,409
ruins your hard disk or anything like

884
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:52,210
that or your cloud storage is being

885
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:54,520
deleted for whatever reason mirror

886
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:56,170
everything back everything up in

887
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,790
different locations I for example have

888
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:59,980
three different locations where are two

889
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:01,270
automated backups and I don't think that

890
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,530
I can't really lose stuff because

891
00:30:01,270 --> 00:30:03,790
they're completely isolated from each

892
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:06,010
other has nothing to do with each other

893
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:09,820
so I'm feeling fairly ok if I lose my

894
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:11,530
laptop today doesn't matter could happen

895
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,840
I mean I don't want to lose it but it's

896
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:16,120
not gonna throw me back too much

897
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:18,159
exercise that practice advanced what we

898
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:20,260
for example do or what I do once a year

899
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:22,060
is pretty much play the chaos monkey and

900
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:24,129
just like delete my partition and test

901
00:30:22,060 --> 00:30:25,200
how long it takes me to be fully

902
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:27,670
productive again

903
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,410
meanwhile I'm around about six hours and

904
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:30,970
after six hours I'm up and running again

905
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,580
I have everything that I need my backup

906
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:33,799
is plated

907
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:35,149
and I can start working again of course

908
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:36,710
there's details here and details there

909
00:30:35,149 --> 00:30:38,539
but if you practice this a little bit

910
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:40,669
you will be pretty much safe against the

911
00:30:38,539 --> 00:30:41,989
chaos monkey that is attempting to kind

912
00:30:40,669 --> 00:30:43,519
of destroy your work and you won't lose

913
00:30:41,989 --> 00:30:45,679
data anymore and you're gonna be back on

914
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:48,049
track as quickly as possible you can use

915
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,429
for example SVN or gate that is external

916
00:30:48,049 --> 00:30:50,960
and a couple of other tools that

917
00:30:49,429 --> 00:30:53,690
basically allow you to do backup I use

918
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,549
SVN as a backup tool is that smart maybe

919
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:58,249
not but it works for me and so far it

920
00:30:55,549 --> 00:31:02,570
has saved me multiple times so I'm doing

921
00:30:58,249 --> 00:31:04,009
this now about the final egg and this is

922
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,389
like the most important act because it's

923
00:31:04,009 --> 00:31:06,859
mentioned we're gonna talk about

924
00:31:05,389 --> 00:31:08,689
ourselves are gonna talk about people

925
00:31:06,859 --> 00:31:11,389
about staying sane because we're all

926
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:13,039
just humans and a lot of pressure might

927
00:31:11,389 --> 00:31:15,080
actually drag us down real hard and we

928
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:17,389
don't want that it doesn't make sense to

929
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,980
first build something awesome and run it

930
00:31:17,389 --> 00:31:20,779
and then realize that one was too much

931
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:22,549
and you're burned out you can't do it

932
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:23,929
anymore and then watch we don't want to

933
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:26,480
have that so let's talk about how to

934
00:31:23,929 --> 00:31:27,649
actually stay sane and deal with all the

935
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,239
pressures and all the challenges that

936
00:31:27,649 --> 00:31:34,699
are actually existing in our field and

937
00:31:29,239 --> 00:31:38,480
in other fields as well sorry surviving

938
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:41,419
all the it's one of the most

939
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:44,090
hardest parts in this job I feel because

940
00:31:41,419 --> 00:31:46,519
clients will give you so much idiotic

941
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:48,168
feedback really oh my god this can't be

942
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:49,460
true the ideas that they sometimes have

943
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:52,369
the expectations that they sometimes

944
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:54,350
have are absolutely crazy and if you let

945
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:56,238
these things go under your skin this

946
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:57,949
might be really bad so you shouldn't do

947
00:31:56,239 --> 00:31:59,659
this you should grow a tougher skin and

948
00:31:57,950 --> 00:32:01,340
make sure that they can't drag you down

949
00:31:59,659 --> 00:32:03,259
with their nonsense not all clients of

950
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:05,689
course only a small portion of clients

951
00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:08,600
will do this but this is oftentimes

952
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:11,529
enough to ruin your day and then ruin it

953
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,529
for other clients as well of course

954
00:32:11,739 --> 00:32:15,649
usually or from my experience like the

955
00:32:14,539 --> 00:32:17,179
first clients you have are the nice

956
00:32:15,649 --> 00:32:18,949
clients because this mention is probably

957
00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:20,480
the people that you already know or had

958
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:22,999
contact with so they're not gonna be

959
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,919
nasty to you but then word goes around

960
00:32:22,999 --> 00:32:27,289
and people start to learn about your

961
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:28,970
company and recommend your company and

962
00:32:27,289 --> 00:32:30,499
eventually you will have your first

963
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:32,480
client like the first client that is

964
00:32:30,499 --> 00:32:33,980
like really annoying and can't be

965
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,029
appreciated in any way of course they

966
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,710
gives you money and you give them

967
00:32:35,029 --> 00:32:38,130
services but in the end at some point

968
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,510
you might realize

969
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:41,390
I actually don't want your money because

970
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:43,710
no this is not do not not pleasant

971
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:44,880
mention the first ones are usually quite

972
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:48,059
nice and quite fair

973
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,970
but the bad ones will come and the

974
00:32:48,059 --> 00:32:52,799
question is what did you do with them

975
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:54,690
that's a bit hard to say and a thing is

976
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:57,179
like important to kind of first classify

977
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:58,530
them to classify and categorize the bad

978
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:01,110
clients that you're gonna have at some

979
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:02,820
point because there's a variety of bad

980
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:05,840
clients that you can have I call them

981
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:08,639
asterisk holes will not be too graphic

982
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,980
so there is the first category of Esther

983
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:14,480
is Kol that basically says your rates

984
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:16,980
are too high you should be much cheaper

985
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:18,630
this is such a douche move because

986
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:21,870
effectively the client tells you that

987
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:24,480
your work is bad how can they even dare

988
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:26,459
doing that how can they dare telling you

989
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,260
that you should be cheaper you don't go

990
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,520
to the to the to the car dealership and

991
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,919
says like this is a very nice

992
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,809
mercedes-benz here but I just want to

993
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:35,400
pay half because I think that's

994
00:33:33,809 --> 00:33:38,760
appropriate and the car dealer would say

995
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:40,490
 off go away you can do that too you

996
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:43,860
can be that car dealer it's just like

997
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:46,080
ridiculous they exist and they will come

998
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:47,490
they will even lie at you they will say

999
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,139
like well we have a couple of other

1000
00:33:47,490 --> 00:33:51,330
vendors on the line as well and they're

1001
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,620
much cheaper then go with them then

1002
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:54,510
don't come to us go with the other

1003
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:56,850
vendors if that's better if cheap is

1004
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:58,590
important let go with them you don't

1005
00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:01,080
have to deal with that there's so many

1006
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:03,149
clients in the world how many people is

1007
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:05,879
the world moment on inhabit six seven

1008
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:08,340
billion so many clients you don't need

1009
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:11,280
this one then there's another asterisk

1010
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:13,590
all category and that is your report was

1011
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:15,990
so bad we're so disappointed I'm not

1012
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:17,909
gonna pay you I'm gonna pay you less we

1013
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:19,589
had that usually you have a contract

1014
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:21,119
that kind of makes you think sure but we

1015
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:23,369
often had clients that kind of stalled

1016
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,359
us our report was excellent it was

1017
00:34:23,369 --> 00:34:26,010
really really good

1018
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:27,509
the team spent a lot of energy and then

1019
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:29,250
the client tries to kind of push the

1020
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:31,440
price a little bit by making us feel bad

1021
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:33,149
the first one the first Esther iskills

1022
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:35,850
is like you're too expensive the second

1023
00:34:33,149 --> 00:34:37,980
one says like oh your work is bad kick

1024
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:39,480
them out fire them don't work with them

1025
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:43,199
you don't need them the world is big

1026
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:44,550
enough another category that that I'm

1027
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,239
pretty much confronted with at least

1028
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:50,649
once a month

1029
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:52,839
often times even more often is the Shuar

1030
00:34:50,649 --> 00:34:54,969
next week's test is definitely gonna

1031
00:34:52,839 --> 00:34:56,980
happen you reserve the slots for us we

1032
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:58,598
prefer we prepared everything perfectly

1033
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:00,490
okay we're gonna start fresh on a Monday

1034
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:02,380
and on Monday morning you heard nothing

1035
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:04,118
from them and on Tuesday morning you

1036
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:05,380
heard nothing from them and on Wednesday

1037
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:07,000
their righteousness like yeah we had a

1038
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:08,500
little bit of a delay it's like Bentham

1039
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,030
is sitting here and waiting and idling

1040
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,440
we're not making money right now we just

1041
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,490
like sitting here and waiting so yeah

1042
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,320
I'm so sorry

1043
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:15,549
can we start next week no we can't

1044
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,680
because next week we have a different

1045
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:19,930
project we don't have time next week oh

1046
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,000
can you not move things around like no

1047
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:24,240
we can't we move things are out already

1048
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:26,980
for you but giving you a slot and

1049
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:28,779
planning and reaching out to you for the

1050
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,190
preparations and you didn't answer we're

1051
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:32,020
not going to do this again it's very

1052
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:34,000
very annoying but it's another situation

1053
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,920
where you need to discipline the client

1054
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,570
and tell them no this doesn't fly we're

1055
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,910
not gonna do it next week we hit this

1056
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:41,710
week plant and no other week at some

1057
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:42,759
point they learn but it's painful it's

1058
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:45,369
like once most of the one of the most

1059
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:47,290
painful test results in my opinion and

1060
00:35:45,369 --> 00:35:48,790
then the most important one that we just

1061
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:50,140
had this we just had this case it was

1062
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:52,029
ridiculous I'm gonna tell the story

1063
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:54,368
about this the client that basically

1064
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:56,170
says we're gonna pay you for the work

1065
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:58,690
that you did that was defined in the

1066
00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:01,030
contract and then we're gonna keep

1067
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:02,650
sending you emails with questions over

1068
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:04,030
and over again and ask for more more

1069
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:05,410
more more and more another report

1070
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,820
another editing another version here's

1071
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:08,049
another question how do we fix this back

1072
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:09,250
what is going on here can you have a

1073
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:11,020
look at this particular thing can you do

1074
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:13,599
retest and they expect this to happen

1075
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:15,759
for free we had one client recently that

1076
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,760
are fired with a high level of enjoyment

1077
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,980
that asked for eight reports we had one

1078
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:23,380
in the contract they wanted eight eight

1079
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,609
reports and different versions and then

1080
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,960
they didn't like what we sent them

1081
00:36:24,609 --> 00:36:27,640
because we were still friendly to some

1082
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,770
point and then they took the PDF and

1083
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:32,140
they cracked it open and they modified

1084
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:33,820
it as they liked it and then their CEO

1085
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:35,560
reached out and asked like do you can

1086
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:37,210
kind of publish this instead I wrote it

1087
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,160
how I like it much better it's like

1088
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:41,080
you what are you thinking this is the

1089
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,440
document with our names on you can't do

1090
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:43,330
this

1091
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,859
this is ridiculous there's like Oh

1092
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:47,940
apologies I've heard resolved this was

1093
00:36:44,859 --> 00:36:49,960
okay this is not okay so we fired them

1094
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:52,300
we told them that this should just

1095
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:55,240
please leave and never come back because

1096
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:57,250
we don't need them they need us we don't

1097
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,229
need them and I think this is a good

1098
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,830
methodology at some point when you're

1099
00:36:59,230 --> 00:37:01,900
strong

1100
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:06,310
as a company to just like fire the

1101
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:07,900
clients that you don't need some clients

1102
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:09,190
are really nice the majority of clients

1103
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:11,080
are really nice we have a lot of client

1104
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:12,880
that we really really love because

1105
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,799
they're amazing and they're supportive

1106
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,160
and their respect that we work with them

1107
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,210
on pretty much the same height like

1108
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:21,399
pretty much without this condescending

1109
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:23,260
relationship of vendor client and so on

1110
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,370
this is amazing you're gonna have a lot

1111
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:26,710
of them as well if you're really good

1112
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:29,470
and you should keep them but the ones

1113
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:30,760
that act like enraged five-year-olds you

1114
00:37:29,470 --> 00:37:32,859
need to get rid of them because they

1115
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,270
give you no value at all and they're

1116
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,680
annoying they take your time and they

1117
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:37,330
stress you so much that at some point

1118
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,950
you don't enjoy your job anymore you

1119
00:37:37,330 --> 00:37:41,830
don't enjoy your work anymore and that's

1120
00:37:38,950 --> 00:37:42,850
the last thing that should happen so if

1121
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:45,190
you have a client that is really

1122
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:47,380
unpleasant fire them you can fire

1123
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:48,850
clients and at some point you might

1124
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,870
actually enjoy that feeling when you if

1125
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:52,770
you do this like its said enough is

1126
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:55,720
enough get the out so that's good

1127
00:37:52,770 --> 00:38:00,550
and you should really do this if it's

1128
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:01,750
necessary at some point and that is

1129
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:03,790
something that you need to train as

1130
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,780
early on as possible is tell apart the

1131
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:07,060
good flying through our client from the

1132
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:09,490
bad plans sometimes in the initial phase

1133
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:11,620
it might be a bit bumpy don't fire them

1134
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:13,240
then wait a little bit give them some

1135
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,710
chance gives them some time because

1136
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:16,419
maybe you first need to tell them how

1137
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:18,370
you function and you need to learn how

1138
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:19,690
they function and after some weeks or

1139
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:20,710
after some projects together you will

1140
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:24,550
realize that they're actually quite

1141
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:27,070
great so give him some time but also as

1142
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:29,170
mentioned hire them if needs be if you

1143
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:30,820
realize after some weeks that everything

1144
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:32,440
is like a mess and everything is like

1145
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:34,600
bumpy and the test is not well planned

1146
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,130
from them they are unprepared and they

1147
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:40,180
give you a couple of these asterisk old

1148
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:42,400
categories if that already goes bad then

1149
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:44,290
how can you expect that the invoicing

1150
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,670
process is gonna be smooth because there

1151
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:47,590
is going to be the next problems and

1152
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:51,630
more pain for you and zero pain for them

1153
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:53,650
because they're just desperate calls so

1154
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:55,420
another thing that helps you with these

1155
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:58,060
things and that is something that I

1156
00:38:55,420 --> 00:39:00,310
rarely experience from other security

1157
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:03,220
companies at least not as often as I

1158
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:05,170
would hope to partner up a lot partner

1159
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,790
with other small firms make sure that

1160
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:08,720
you build up a network of small firms

1161
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:11,000
that are similar to you work

1162
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:13,730
them because you're not competitors as

1163
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:15,140
mentioned the market is huge there is no

1164
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:17,300
need to kind of steal each other's

1165
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:18,980
projects rather the contrary invite them

1166
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,750
to join your project if the contract

1167
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:22,460
allows tell the client that you partner

1168
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:24,290
up with someone else to kind of handle

1169
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:26,210
the project and build up a network of

1170
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:28,580
friendly other companies around you I

1171
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:30,200
know a couple of companies in Berlin who

1172
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:31,220
for a long time didn't partner at all

1173
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,799
they were just like pretty much like a

1174
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:36,140
fortress and then there was a managerial

1175
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,820
change and they opened up and ever since

1176
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:39,259
then they've been doing much much better

1177
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:42,170
we're a partner with them we work

1178
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:43,790
together we have a fantastic time and we

1179
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:45,380
oftentimes do it in a way that when a

1180
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:46,850
client reaches out to us and says like

1181
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:49,250
well we won't have a penetration test

1182
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:51,230
okay I'm probably gonna be fifteen

1183
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:54,320
person days okay and it should happen

1184
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:55,580
next week that's not gonna fly we don't

1185
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,380
have time next week oh that's too bad

1186
00:39:55,580 --> 00:40:00,140
but we have to do this next week still

1187
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:01,940
not gonna fly but we have a couple of

1188
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:03,529
partner companies that are really good I

1189
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:05,390
can recommend them and then you just

1190
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:07,610
send the client there and everybody's

1191
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:09,379
happy you're happy because you don't

1192
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:11,150
have to kind of over plan things the

1193
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:12,890
partner is happy because they get a cool

1194
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:14,300
job from you and the client is happy

1195
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:16,100
because they get their stuff done on

1196
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:17,630
time and they have the feeling that

1197
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:20,089
you're not there to kind of squeeze

1198
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:21,650
money out of them and kind of pressure

1199
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:23,540
something that is that it's not even

1200
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:25,100
necessary I won't give good results but

1201
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:27,140
you have their security in your best

1202
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:30,940
interest so just like passing them on to

1203
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:34,250
the next best partner and everybody wins

1204
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:38,360
partnering is also a thing that will I

1205
00:40:34,250 --> 00:40:40,250
be helping you to survive q4 who knows

1206
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:42,040
what I mean with that surviving q4 like

1207
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:44,810
the fourth quarter of the year

1208
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:48,440
that's the diarist of all times because

1209
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:50,299
in q4 there is so much budget left and

1210
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,700
it needs to be poured out on some people

1211
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:54,620
so in q4 at some point once you like

1212
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:56,240
more well-known as a company everybody

1213
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:58,279
will come and want their pen test people

1214
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,779
come six months in advance just to make

1215
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:01,550
sure that they get a slot in September

1216
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:03,110
or October or something like this and

1217
00:41:01,550 --> 00:41:04,850
you will definitely be close to Bernard

1218
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:07,460
in this quarter because the workload is

1219
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:10,130
insane everything always seems to happen

1220
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:13,340
in q4 q1 is then usually very very calm

1221
00:41:10,130 --> 00:41:15,980
you can relax again but q4 is darkness

1222
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:18,200
light tons of work tons of money most

1223
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:19,880
probably tons of challenges but I would

1224
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,350
close I would be close to say that in

1225
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,740
this particular quarter and this is what

1226
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:23,990
we

1227
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:25,250
it's just too much but if you have

1228
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:27,109
partners where you can share the

1229
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:28,309
workload with it's much easier just

1230
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:29,930
gives em pom products and they do

1231
00:41:28,309 --> 00:41:32,119
something with you and so on you pretty

1232
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:33,859
much you share the pressure with others

1233
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:35,150
and again that makes everybody happy

1234
00:41:33,859 --> 00:41:36,078
makes you happy makes your partner's

1235
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:38,750
happy makes your clients I mean

1236
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:41,119
everybody wins in the end I mean of

1237
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:42,980
course partnering might fail and your

1238
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:45,950
partner might be letter asterisk oh and

1239
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:47,960
you might get burnt but quite honestly

1240
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:49,910
that never happened to us and I think

1241
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:51,559
it's worth the risk of that happening

1242
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:56,629
because the benefits are just like so

1243
00:41:51,559 --> 00:41:59,809
big so q4 as mentioned be prepared for

1244
00:41:56,630 --> 00:42:01,670
this it's a really tough quarter and the

1245
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:03,529
more well-known you are and the more

1246
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:05,599
clients you get the more work will come

1247
00:42:03,529 --> 00:42:06,799
at you in q4 we meanwhile have like a

1248
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:09,500
meeting in the team where we basically

1249
00:42:06,799 --> 00:42:11,660
select okay everybody brace yourselves

1250
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:14,150
q4 is coming and it's gonna be bad and

1251
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:15,558
we have like mechanisms how I can make

1252
00:42:14,150 --> 00:42:17,119
sure that people don't get too much work

1253
00:42:15,559 --> 00:42:18,410
they can kind of opt-out says like hey I

1254
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,849
need a week off I can't do it anymore

1255
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:21,288
because it's too much and so on and so

1256
00:42:19,849 --> 00:42:22,430
on you will find your tools you will

1257
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:24,829
find your mechanisms that allows you to

1258
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:26,480
do this but make sure that in this

1259
00:42:24,829 --> 00:42:28,849
quarter you don't burn out because it

1260
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:30,740
ever goes so quickly I myself at the

1261
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:33,230
problem last year last year I was close

1262
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:34,879
to a burnout like full-on like the the

1263
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:36,619
non funny parts was like getting panic

1264
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,970
attacks and crying all of a sudden like

1265
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:40,339
all these things just being completely

1266
00:42:37,970 --> 00:42:42,828
done make sure that this doesn't happen

1267
00:42:40,339 --> 00:42:45,020
to you because it's all about the fun of

1268
00:42:42,829 --> 00:42:46,910
the work that you will have and it's not

1269
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:48,559
worth to burnout and there is always

1270
00:42:46,910 --> 00:42:51,049
tools and mechanisms that can prevent

1271
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:52,849
that from happening don't value the

1272
00:42:51,049 --> 00:42:54,500
money and the work too much also value

1273
00:42:52,849 --> 00:42:57,589
yourself because that's in the end the

1274
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:58,130
most important part don't underestimate

1275
00:42:57,589 --> 00:43:00,230
it

1276
00:42:58,130 --> 00:43:02,270
because burnout is a DIYer of thinking

1277
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:04,549
it's hard to recover from that it takes

1278
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:06,288
a lot of time once you're really in that

1279
00:43:04,549 --> 00:43:08,299
particular zone it might take months

1280
00:43:06,289 --> 00:43:09,890
maybe even years for you to get back I

1281
00:43:08,299 --> 00:43:11,210
know a couple of people who had burnout

1282
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:12,740
and they were gone they were like

1283
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:14,480
disappearing from the field for an

1284
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:16,640
entire year you don't want this to

1285
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,369
happen to you so be very respectful of

1286
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:20,660
your own boundaries and your own

1287
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:21,980
pressure levels that you can take and

1288
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:25,069
make sure that this doesn't happen to

1289
00:43:21,980 --> 00:43:26,900
you and if it means that you can't do a

1290
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:28,460
certain project and you have to delay it

1291
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,869
then so be it you are more important in

1292
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:32,030
the project your health is more

1293
00:43:29,869 --> 00:43:34,070
important than the projects

1294
00:43:32,030 --> 00:43:35,690
you need to however learn that your

1295
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:37,160
pressure levels and the amount of

1296
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:38,810
pressure that you can take will grow

1297
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:39,799
over time like you will get used to

1298
00:43:38,810 --> 00:43:41,900
things as mentioned you will grow a

1299
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:43,250
thicker skin and eventually you will be

1300
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:45,110
like strong enough to kind of take a

1301
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:46,700
workload that you couldn't take two

1302
00:43:45,110 --> 00:43:48,410
years ago but you can take it now and

1303
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,629
maybe in the future you will be able to

1304
00:43:48,410 --> 00:43:52,700
take even more but don't overdo it

1305
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:58,100
don't test yourself too hard it's not

1306
00:43:52,700 --> 00:44:00,020
worth it effectively the only thing that

1307
00:43:58,100 --> 00:44:02,150
you need or that you can do here is like

1308
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:05,030
look at yourself observe yourself and

1309
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:06,290
ask your peers how am i doing kind of

1310
00:44:05,030 --> 00:44:08,450
give you the impression that I'm close

1311
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:10,910
to a burnout is everything still okay

1312
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:13,759
and they will likely help you and tell

1313
00:44:10,910 --> 00:44:15,200
you well you are quite erratic recently

1314
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,640
so you should be taking care of little

1315
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,100
but if they say something like that to

1316
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:21,109
you or if they show you concern respect

1317
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:23,600
that and actually follow their advice

1318
00:44:21,110 --> 00:44:24,770
and step down a little bit from the

1319
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:29,029
extreme pressure that you're giving

1320
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:30,440
yourself don't burn out because you're

1321
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:32,510
the most important part in this company

1322
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:34,190
at your building and your team is the

1323
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:35,420
most important part in this indistinct

1324
00:44:34,190 --> 00:44:37,520
your building so also watch out for

1325
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:39,320
others help others by telling them if

1326
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,580
you have the feeling that it's the time

1327
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:44,660
that they should kind of step back a

1328
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:48,560
little bit so we're almost at the end of

1329
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:50,390
the presentation and let's sum it up be

1330
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,759
organized organize yourself that's the

1331
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:54,170
most important thing be more organized

1332
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,370
than your clients because they will come

1333
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:56,030
at you and they won't be organized

1334
00:44:55,370 --> 00:44:58,549
perchance

1335
00:44:56,030 --> 00:45:00,380
be open be open for new things to come

1336
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:01,940
in don't kind of lock everything down be

1337
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:03,290
open for partnering sometimes for

1338
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:04,610
interesting or for weird clients just

1339
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:07,490
accept them and see what happens because

1340
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:09,080
what could go wrong be strict make sure

1341
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:10,640
that the client follows your rules as

1342
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:12,980
well you follow the clients rules they

1343
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:15,980
have to follow your rules be stubborn if

1344
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:18,350
something doesn't go the way you want it

1345
00:45:15,980 --> 00:45:20,870
try to make that this happens kind of

1346
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:22,100
tell the client that it doesn't fly if

1347
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:24,140
they want this and this and it and that

1348
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:27,080
and then change directions tell them

1349
00:45:24,140 --> 00:45:28,310
what the track is on which you and the

1350
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,750
client can actually navigate together

1351
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:31,370
and last but not least

1352
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:32,900
needless to say be brilliant we always

1353
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:35,120
as good as you can and what you do and

1354
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:37,070
don't lose the fun because the fun is

1355
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:39,319
pretty much the fuel for brilliance

1356
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:41,150
so make sure that you have fun in your

1357
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:43,670
job then the brilliance will come

1358
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:46,070
organize yourself be strong stand for

1359
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:47,270
yourself watch out for your team don't

1360
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:47,810
burn out and then you're gonna have a

1361
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:50,780
good time

1362
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:53,150
so that's but at least be mindful it

1363
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:54,830
still just jabs it she'll just work it

1364
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:56,540
still just project it's not life and

1365
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:58,850
death you're still the most important

1366
00:45:56,540 --> 00:46:01,850
part is the human and please never

1367
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:03,770
forget that if you burn out if you can't

1368
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:05,450
deliver what you like to deliver any

1369
00:46:03,770 --> 00:46:08,870
more than no one wins and no one wants

1370
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:11,330
that so I think we've reached the end of

1371
00:46:08,870 --> 00:46:13,580
the presentation and I hope that now you

1372
00:46:11,330 --> 00:46:15,830
have some pointers that might help you

1373
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:17,900
building your own thing and staying sane

1374
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:19,610
in the process as mentioned you managed

1375
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:20,960
my very and there was probably a lot of

1376
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,460
things that were specific to us or

1377
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:26,030
specific to others but I think that

1378
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:27,110
least there's a couple of common ground

1379
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:28,790
that we can see in this presentation

1380
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:30,680
that might help you to actually kind of

1381
00:46:28,790 --> 00:46:32,960
do your thing and end up as being very

1382
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:36,799
very happy and that's the most important

1383
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:38,330
things so just know if you're unhappy as

1384
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,710
an employee or unhappy with what you're

1385
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:41,600
doing right now it doesn't have to be

1386
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:43,370
like this you have the power to create

1387
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:46,339
your own thing it can be fun doesn't

1388
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:47,839
have to be it can also fail but usually

1389
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:49,850
it goes quite well and it's likely going

1390
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:51,920
to be cool and one thing that is most

1391
00:46:49,850 --> 00:46:54,080
important to say right now right now in

1392
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,880
InfoSec we're leaving in the fat years

1393
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:57,529
where like there's projects and clients

1394
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:59,150
all over the place we never had that

1395
00:46:57,530 --> 00:47:02,060
much work as we have right now because

1396
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:03,710
of regulations and the general situation

1397
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:06,500
and the news reporting on hacker attacks

1398
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:08,200
and whatnot these are the fad yours now

1399
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:12,800
is the time to if you get started and

1400
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:14,930
why not try not to be a whale

1401
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:17,240
try not to kind of grow too much stay

1402
00:47:14,930 --> 00:47:21,410
like a wasp or a Hornet say agile and

1403
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:23,029
small and dangerous and edgy stay or

1404
00:47:21,410 --> 00:47:25,460
become the team that you want to be

1405
00:47:23,030 --> 00:47:27,410
build what you want to have and pretty

1406
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:29,360
much then there's nothing in the way

1407
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:31,580
between you and a successful project and

1408
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:32,780
a successful company and your being

1409
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:34,370
happy in the end don't be too dried out

1410
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:36,950
therefrom be value driven help your

1411
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:39,620
clients help your team help yourself and

1412
00:47:36,950 --> 00:47:41,330
have a good time so maybe it's time

1413
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:43,339
right now maybe this inspires people

1414
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:45,140
here to create their own companies just

1415
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:47,540
like see whether it works or not

1416
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:49,288
I think now is a good time so why not

1417
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:50,549
right right now and

1418
00:47:49,289 --> 00:47:52,370
I wish you the best of luck and that's

1419
00:47:50,549 --> 00:47:55,460
all that I have thank you very much

1420
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:55,460
[Applause]
