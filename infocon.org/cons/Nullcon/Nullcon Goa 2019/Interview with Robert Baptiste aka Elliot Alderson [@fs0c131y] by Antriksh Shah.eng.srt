know me from Twitter I'm used to tweet

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:28,960

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:33,790
website on offense under the username F

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:37,510
Society so last year I started to work

10
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:42,390
on official other application other

11
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:45,670
applications so I found several issues

12
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:49,120
in it so I started to have a lot of

13
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:53,879
photos in India and started to discuss

14
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:57,159
with a lot of info signals from India

15
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:59,968
after that I you lolly position other

16
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:03,339
leaks on some vulnerabilities in India

17
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:06,430
in Indian websites I also found some

18
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:09,789
interesting stuff in the demo

19
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:15,399
application is the application of the

20
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:20,350
Prime Minister so it's a pleasure for me

21
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:22,689
to to connect with the Indian InfoSec

22
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:27,189
community and to be able to discuss with

23
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:30,219
you even if I'm not physically here in

24
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:31,439
India and I can discuss with you so this

25
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:34,240

26
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:38,139

28
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:57,520

29
00:01:40,600 --> 00:02:00,780
country can you look it yeah yes I guess

30
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,548
as if your government doesn't really

31
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:07,329
doesn't really look what I'm doing and

32
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:10,720
sometimes people don't like when you

33
00:02:07,329 --> 00:02:13,950
will show some issue in their in their

34
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,319
systems website or application and

35
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:19,310
iPhones

36
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:23,388
one issue in either under all phones

37
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:27,760
Prime Minister applications or I will

38
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:27,760
not take the risk to come in India fauna

39
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:43,730
yes

40
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:55,609
the other thing I can fight yeah maybe

41
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:57,649
maybe one day you guys yeah okay so I'm

42
00:02:55,609 --> 00:03:00,379
gonna ask you few questions and then I

43
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:11,180
keep the suggestion open for the

44
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:14,090
audience questions asked why Indian

45
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:17,030
websites Indian applications you know by

46
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:23,959
the you know or even political person

47
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:26,239
why India yes this is a question and

48
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:29,299
this is the most frequent question and

49
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,699
receiving on Twitter why's the hell a

50
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:36,139
French alike means pinging so much time

51
00:03:31,699 --> 00:03:39,439
on India haps on the website so the

52
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:41,449
answer is quite simple if India is an

53
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:44,989
amazing country we've has many

54
00:03:41,449 --> 00:03:46,879
challenges to face with a population of

55
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:50,709
this size having the future of

56
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:53,388
cyberspace is an almost impossible task

57
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:55,329
so this is why I'm so interested by

58
00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:58,669
India because there is a lot of history

59
00:03:55,329 --> 00:04:02,930
improve and as a security researcher of

60
00:03:58,669 --> 00:04:05,659
this is super interested to study this

61
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:09,459
kind of system when you are so much

62
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:12,679
people impacted by the same system the

63
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:17,840
security aspect of this systems are

64
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:20,719
super interesting and to be honest my

65
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:25,929
initial encounter with India is a pure

66
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:29,420
is clearly random at the beginning of to

67
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:32,120
2018 a lot of my followers

68
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:38,180
asked me to check the ADA application

69
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:41,270
the official Android application like I

70
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:44,300
was young guys I asked me so I decided

71
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:46,549
to give it to Luke and I found like five

72
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:47,620
of fifty hundred mobility big

73
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,990
venerability

74
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:55,180
so after that I started to receive a lot

75
00:04:50,990 --> 00:05:00,050
of exposure events like the Indian media

76
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:03,440
and my Twitter icons started to become a

77
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:05,570
famous among the Indian and forsake

78
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:08,810
community and I started to have a lot of

79
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:12,290
Indian followers and with all these

80
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:15,740
followers I discuss a lot on the disk I

81
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:17,990

107
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:08,039
news channel as well oh we have problems

108
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:08,040
with the Internet

109
00:07:47,529 --> 00:07:50,369
of Audion things

110
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:39,260

114
00:08:44,720 --> 00:09:02,079
so just fixing the Internet okay so

115
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:02,079
rejoining again

116
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:25,310
okay yes will you let us know any of

117
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,870
your experiences in reporting issues

118
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:34,510
with the Indian government or any

119
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:37,910
politicians yes of course so first

120
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:40,519
making responsible disclosure is and

121
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:42,469
this is very common especially in a

122
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:45,079
country like India where you have a lot

123
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:47,600
of yaki level and where I can be super

124
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:51,260
complicated to contains a person in

125
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:54,140
charge but contrary to what people tend

126
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:56,899
to think when you manage to reach to the

127
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:59,839
correct person people are pretty nice

128
00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:03,110
and when you have some technical guy

129
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:08,600
talking with you in general these people

130
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:12,920
want to fix the issue when I disk use

131
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:16,520
for example with application team of the

132
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:19,040
900 II application this guy were pretty

133
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:22,399
nice with me and I just wanted to

134
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:27,770
understand what was the problem on all

135
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:30,130
to fix the problem so I know making

136
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:34,399
responsible disclosure is complicated

137
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:37,970
but you have to try you have to try to

138
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:40,700
contact concept companion you have to

139
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:45,560
keep in mind that the most important

140
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:49,100
things is to protect the personal data

141
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:52,489
of people so when you are communicating

142
00:10:49,100 --> 00:11:09,560
about an issue you take care if you are

143
00:10:52,490 --> 00:11:13,130
some personal data of user at risk they

144
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:19,060
came to me one minute after publishing

145
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:22,220
my tooth is a contact and say some me a

146
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:31,699
private message and on Twitter

147
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:35,000
one minute after do you have any message

148
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:37,160
to the Indian government on how they

149
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:42,280
should ensure the security of the

150
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:42,280
infrastructure or on the UID system

151
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:51,079
after all

152
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:55,130
I'm working on a deal for more than one

153
00:11:51,080 --> 00:12:00,290
year I found several issues I try to

154
00:11:55,130 --> 00:12:05,450
contact you ID several times but this

155
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:09,610
guy as as only one organization who

156
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:16,730
never answered to me and I always denied

157
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:21,800
what I found and accept accept lame

158
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:25,370
press releases they are doing nothing

159
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:29,719
and they try to fix silently the issues

160
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:31,610
so the first step should be in my

161
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:35,810
opinion the first step should be for the

162
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:38,720
googleman for you either to be nice with

163

them give them an email address to some

165
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:51,530
issues gives them a secure channel to

166
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:54,230
communicate the issue as they are here

167
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:57,010
to help you they are here to fix the

168
00:12:54,230 --> 00:13:00,350
problem and to make the system better so

169
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:05,300
security researcher the InfoSec

170
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:24,230
community is really a friend on the one

171
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:29,000
who makes it good you IDI pvp or five

172
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:31,970
degrees I never take fitness ok another

173
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:34,770
thing I may have not done my home book

174
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:37,140
I'm not studying much but most of

175
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:41,100
issue that I think you have either

176
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:43,319
reported in public is not the data leak

177
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:46,250
of the CVR

178
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,450
or UID system it's actually by different

179
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:53,850
departments or different agencies that

180
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:58,250
use that system right yeah we found that

181
00:13:53,850 --> 00:14:03,350
we found a leak in front of some

182
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:09,660
shorties website by using the idea that

183
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:15,870
if fungus or some issues directly is the

184
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:18,329
ideal system on the they don't listen on

185
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:20,250
at least as I don't communicate with

186
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:23,940
security researcher what it was the

187
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:27,570
issue they fund but my change so this is

188
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:34,110
also this is also the responsibility or

189
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:38,160
you iodide to - Angelo's a GI bleed that

190
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:42,930
is safely stored values of your parties

191
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:46,110
because because if third party of patent

192
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:50,339
company is authorized to collect all the

193
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:53,459
data of this companionship a secure

194
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:56,720
storage for feed data because it's not

195
00:14:53,459 --> 00:15:00,930
acceptable for continue to stir and you

196
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:03,060
indicate you I don't know what it was

197
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:08,219
the official document in a open

198
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:11,849
directory and n DS by D so finding some

199
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:21,480
inner cat directly for google searches

200
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:23,670
is not okay audience do you want to

201
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:27,290
reveal anything interesting or about

202

206
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:48,230
analyzes not finished so I will add ISTA

207
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:52,160
right now better we will have mostly to

208
00:15:48,230 --> 00:16:09,440
come for all for sure yes okay any

209
00:15:52,160 --> 00:16:11,569
questions from the audience yeah so I

210
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:15,170
understand some background on this that

211
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:18,590
some agencies that use other data is not

212
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:22,240
you know clearly maintaining security

213
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:25,580
aspect or will this be something

214
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:28,210
question to the NCI ap folks here will

215
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:32,420
this be something you guys can help

216
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:35,390
people like Baptist to kind of middleman

217
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:37,189
that yeah I'm just trying to get a

218
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,720
background for all the other folks you

219
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:42,050
know who wants to disclose some

220
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:48,890
vulnerability so I'll just pass on the

221
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:51,949
mic to you sir is that okay okay the

222
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:55,160
question was to it yet yeah the question

223
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:57,140
was to Elliott know it's kind of you

224
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:59,810
know I'm trying to set the roads on

225
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:02,300
where we can solve this issue you know

226
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:07,960
your question is do you think NCI facie

227
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:13,909
in bridge this gap exactly yeah okay so

228
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:17,030
we have an agency call as NCI a PC that

229
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:19,160
would like to be a part and associate

230
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:22,129
with you you do responsible disclosure

231
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:24,760
and reduce the gap between you know the

232
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:27,500
government then the security community

233
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,390
so if you would like to talk to any

234
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:33,730
organization in the country I think NCI

235
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:36,880
PC would be Allstate agree for it yeah

236
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:42,090
he was he is it the question

237
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:50,590
all right any other question

238
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:53,770
no no I just wanted to add one more

239
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:57,429
thing when you get in touch em anyway

240
00:17:53,770 --> 00:18:02,110
talking I know they can hear me but when

241
00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:05,170
we're talking about okay I'll say it and

242
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:08,050
then you can draw in it so when we talk

243
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:15,310
about our VDP and we talk about giving

244
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:17,139
us an importance let's be patient to

245
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:18,879
communicate the problem he has to

246
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:22,330
understand the problem somebody has to

247
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:27,970
fix the problem so all of this takes

248
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:30,520
time if you give us an input and expect

249
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:34,900
us to fix it in 24-48 hours it may not

250
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:38,050
happen that doesn't indicate that

251
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:39,490
nothing is happening you know if you

252
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:42,370
tell a major company or major

253
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:44,320
organization boss you got a problem he

254
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:46,750
has to accept the problem own it then

255
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:53,530
only will he fix it so when you report

256
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:56,380
something be patient the input from the

257
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:58,450
organization of ncip see is that when

258
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:00,460
you report something they request you to

259
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:03,700
be patient it can't be fixed

260
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:07,390
but in a day or two there are procedures

261
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:09,040
and policies follow in order to fix an

262
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,420
issue because everything is not in their

263
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:13,210
control they have stock to meet

264
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:15,790
different stakeholders so this is the

265
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:21,570
response or input from the organization

266
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:21,570
do you have a response to that or yeah

267
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:34,510
yes yes yes I am I have some some issue

268
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:39,280
with that because when you have so much

269
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:42,540
data in at risk when you have me in yeah

270
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:46,540
at least your personal data of people

271
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:50,830
occurs on the malicious people you can

272
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:53,530
explore attendance data easily

273
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:58,320
a policy that don't help what process

274
00:19:53,530 --> 00:20:01,330
under just done so data on cell the data

275
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:06,850
to people who want to buy it

276
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:12,159
so having policy process is okay but you

277
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:14,830
have to understand that malicious people

278
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:20,050
don't have a bishop is why I am so

279
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:24,550
interested and I so I want to fill the

280
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:27,250
issue as quickly as possible because if

281
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:30,639
the data at risk managers people just

282
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:35,650
get it so I have no problem to discuss

283
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:38,530
with any agency I don't have any problem

284
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:41,800
I'll collaborate with police the

285
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:45,580
government and it will be a pleasure for

286
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:48,340
me but you have to be dynamic and you

287
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:52,149
have to understand that you cannot take

288
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:55,000
months to solve an issue and this is

289
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:58,810
what I managed to do thanks to my

290
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:03,640
Twitter account some for example for the

291
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:08,770
latest ADA leaked I published we try to

292
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:11,950
contact the company for four days I'm

293
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:17,080
saying never answered but just after the

294
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:20,560
leak and just after a secure secure a

295
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:24,310
publication as they fix the issue in

296
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:29,470
three hours so it's possible to fix the

297
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:32,879
issue quickly and once again malicious

298
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:32,880
people don't care about process

299
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:19,408
different question so how do you choose

300
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:29,940
your applications to find bugs how do

301
00:22:19,409 --> 00:22:33,840
the how do you use that I didn't have a

302
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:37,620
clear process to be honest I have a big

303
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:43,949
big to-do list with a lot of application

304
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:46,020
names that may need followers and on

305
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:49,529
Twitter thanks to the pilot Michigan

306
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:52,789
listening when I'm seeing that a lot of

307
00:22:49,529 --> 00:22:55,649
people who want to analyze and the same

308
00:22:52,789 --> 00:23:18,960
petition and understand nice application

309
00:22:55,649 --> 00:23:21,090
to my to-do list and thanks so much and

310
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:23,309
I'm sure that the community has

311
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:25,520
committed to bring you safely to the

312
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:29,190
country and make sure your return match

313
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:35,029
NCI PC has agreed to take help from you

314
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:35,029
and ensure that they would fix it okay

315
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:54,270
okay so there is a link called our VD P

316
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:58,020
dot NCI pcs are done in a V DP at the

317
00:23:54,270 --> 00:24:00,480
rate ncip see the dot in is an email

318
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:04,139
link so an email account which you can

319
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:06,620
report was abilities to he doesn't want

320
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,620
to listen to you

321
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:12,560
so yeah there's an email address or

322
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:16,280
related responsively disclosed

323
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:17,540
vulnerabilities - and I think you should

324
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,180
do that you have been doing that in the

325
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:23,360
past but this is an official statement

326
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:25,160
I was officiating but response from one

327
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:27,649
of the organizations that they would

328
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:29,840
want you to report issues and Magne be

329
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:31,430
teased to them and they would take it up

330
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:37,659
with different organizations and

331
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:39,920
