1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,920
hey guys has everyone had coffee just

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:12,280
making sure before you start yes

3
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:14,590
all right good very well done hey so um

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:16,390
I wasn't sure if I understood the exact

5
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:18,850
notion of the flashback track so what

6
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:20,650
I'm gonna do is for some reason take you

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:21,820
through this life that I had done last

8
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:24,119
time and then talk about all the stuff

9
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:28,480
that's changed in the meantime

10
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:30,430
cool ringtone so but what I'd like to do

11
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,810
is if you have questions not if you have

12
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:34,150
a comment that you'd like everyone else

13
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,649
to hear but if you have questions can

14
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,820
you just like let me know because it's

15
00:00:35,649 --> 00:00:43,360
better if we get those out of the way

16
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:45,760
yeah okay all right okay so at the time

17
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,170
that I gave the talk we were actually

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,820
trying to understand you know the

19
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:50,320
relevance of some of this stuff and it

20
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,030
was actually in the midst of some very

21
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,390
serious debates do you guys remember the

22
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:58,930
Apple FBI case all right who wants to

23
00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:00,940
tell someone else what happened anybody

24
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:04,180
if you remember it I've got a lot of

25
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:09,429
nods so if you remember it tell someone

26
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:17,920
else what happened one human what didn't

27
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:24,640
they want to disclose not exactly does

28
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:25,869
anyone yep yes how did they want to

29
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,409
unlock the phone doesn't remember what

30
00:01:25,869 --> 00:01:33,610
they specifically asked the babble you

31
00:01:29,409 --> 00:01:34,810
know Craig just tell them the yeah the

32
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:36,429
pinko but they wanted to do something

33
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,140
specific they actually want to send a

34
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:42,130
software update so they wanted the

35
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:45,399
signing key for iOS all right so here's

36
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:48,939
the deal there is a gradation like a

37
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:51,670
gradient from asking to unlock one

38
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:53,500
iPhone and then asking to have the

39
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,479
sign-in key for iOS you know there's

40
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,369
like a little tiny bit of difference

41
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:58,479
between the two things but those were

42
00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:02,380
the discussions that were happening at

43
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,270
the time and what you saw was the FBI

44
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:07,360
had had their case completely ready they

45
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:09,429
were ready to go so the idea that was

46
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,340
there on the shelf is that okay

47
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:14,200
you know the FBI had been planning this

48
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,640
for ages they were just looking for an

49
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,440
opportunity in order to

50
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,679
come out with all this legal stuff to

51
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,410
try to force Apple to give this type of

52
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,880
cooperation with the authorities and the

53
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,710
way that you look at this problem

54
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,510
whether you think what a it was

55
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:30,610
like a you know almost a terrorist

56
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,560
incident of course Apple should

57
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,670
cooperate and give everything they need

58
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,880
for law enforcement how many of you

59
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:38,950
believe that I'm serious so it's okay it

60
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,210
depends on your point of view right so

61
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,970
if you really believe that there are

62
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:45,490
extreme cases and the usual ones that

63
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:49,080
are used are pedophilia and terrorism

64
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:52,510
where you are forcing cooperation of

65
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:55,120
private companies to assist in these

66
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:57,910
type of law enforcement actions so again

67
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,180
how many of you feel in extreme cases

68
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:02,290
philia terrorism national security that

69
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:06,010
you should cooperate with the

70
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:07,660
authorities okay I'm putting my hand up

71
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,760
for you guys I don't that is not a

72
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:12,040
representation of belief I want to point

73
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,220
out that there is some divide that it's

74
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,030
okay to have this point of view not okay

75
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:19,690
for me to yell at you through the

76
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:22,600
microphone but that this contention

77
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:24,970
means that we have allowed a certain

78
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,709
amount of Rights and permissibility to

79
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:30,370
our governments in order to act on our

80
00:03:26,709 --> 00:03:34,720
behalf to promote and provide for public

81
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:36,730
safety okay sometimes though especially

82
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,109
like what I was presenting this talk

83
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:40,840
there was a concern that there was a

84
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:43,570
huge discrepancy between the initial

85
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,370
intent and the actual action of the

86
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,109
authorities when it came to some of

87
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:49,150
these subjects and you know like I like

88
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:51,519
to say that like national security is

89
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,410
pretty much the root password to

90
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,640
everything over the law case of national

91
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,320
security all right here you go here's

92
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,880
all the data here's access to the

93
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,410
telecommunications network here is

94
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,329
everything that we've ever used you know

95
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:03,700
in every record we've ever maintained

96
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,620
but what you see is that intelligence

97
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,780
agencies as a result of this national

98
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,570
security root password that they have

99
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:12,760
complete and utter information awareness

100
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:14,410
they know everything you know who you

101
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:16,750
call they know where you've been they

102
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:18,820
know all of your list of friends and how

103
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:20,560
they hang out and that these agencies

104
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,260
even though they have this complete

105
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:27,940
unfettered access to all of this data

106
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:30,130
and can force mandatory cooperation and

107
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,350
include that with silence you're never

108
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:34,360
allowed to discuss these issues when you

109
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:36,760
cooperate with the authorities so even

110
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:40,090
though they can do all this they

111
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,800
still are afraid of cryptography and

112
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:43,960
they call this the going dark problem

113
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,160
have you guys heard of that the going

114
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,680
dark problem yeah okay

115
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,450
so what you see is that this going dark

116
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,550
problem of anyone who's using publicly

117
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:53,560
available cryptography to hide in any of

118
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,330
their information is a serious concern

119
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,670
because it means that the Eye of Sauron

120
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,500
that's coming out of these agencies is

121
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:03,340
not able to penetrate these pockets

122
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:05,260
using crypto so you know there's a lot

123
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,060
of attempts to do cryptanalysis to break

124
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,380
the cryptography to do traffic analysis

125
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,330
to try to determine who's talking to who

126
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:12,820
if none of this should come as as

127
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:15,099
strange but even though we knew the

128
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:16,300
extent of which some of these activities

129
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,520
were happening and the mass surveillance

130
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:20,650
was going on you didn't really see a

131
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,780
sort of knee-jerk reaction that was a

132
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:24,609
sort of common reaction from the public

133
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,289
you saw a little bit of outrage on CNN

134
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:28,410
but how many of you live in countries

135
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:31,630
where the legislation actually changed

136
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:33,040
after there's no Danube even in the

137
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,330
United States the legislation didn't

138
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,720
really change after this note in

139
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:40,210
Revelations because the initial thority

140
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,700
where all of the work that was based on

141
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:43,989
the Patriot Act the makers of the

142
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,090
Patriot Act when they were actually

143
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:49,480
conducting a review said no fair

144
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:51,549
interpretation of the Patriot Act could

145
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,130
have led to the abuses which had led to

146
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:56,020
so the makers of the Act themselves

147
00:05:54,130 --> 00:06:00,520
acknowledged that there was a far

148
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:03,490
reaching action that was not in line

149
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:07,049
with the original intent of the Patriot

150
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:10,150
Act and that's really the problem so

151
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:11,830
this stuff talk about flashback it

152
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:14,049
should bring you to the way wayback

153
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:16,060
machine where we had the original crypto

154
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:19,810
words doesn't even remember that it's an

155
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:21,130
age test no original code you do

156
00:06:19,810 --> 00:06:23,710
remember and you're just not putting up

157
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:26,140
your hand Craig right is pointing and so

158
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,430
all the old people in the room and the

159
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:30,310
original crypto wars they were fought in

160
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:32,230
the 1990s and if you remember what it

161
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:34,750
was was that like there were these heads

162
00:06:32,230 --> 00:06:37,539
of the FBI and what they wanted to do

163
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:39,570
was have surveillance capabilities every

164
00:06:37,539 --> 00:06:41,580
we're not even talking about the NSA

165
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:43,260
we're talking about the FBI who wanted

166
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,000
to do this and the guy who was at the

167
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:47,099
FBI who did it and I know they have a

168
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,680
slight resemblance but this was Louis

169
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:51,930
Freeh doesn't you remember him well

170
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:54,120
Louis Freeh was also famous because he

171
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:55,620
investigated the famous blue dress you

172
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,500
know Monica Lewinsky Clinton the blue

173
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:02,870
dress with a stain no one they I don't

174
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:06,570
okay meet me after if you want to know

175
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:08,580
so the clue is so this that's this is

176
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:10,830
guy that was his CV you know he took

177
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:14,190
down the Mafia he thought there's her

178
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:17,159
evil cryptography machine and he managed

179
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,900
to investigate you know Clinton so but

180
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,360
at the time and now I miss him now I

181
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:25,020
like commis my homie stickers everywhere

182
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:28,410
but we also had James Comey who was

183
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:31,950
saying look I don't want backdoors in

184
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:34,320
cryptography I want front doors I want

185
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:37,590
with a court order to be able to come in

186
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:40,650
to anyone's so-called house with a

187
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:42,690
lawful like authority with a warrant and

188
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:45,030
I want to be mandated to do this by the

189
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:46,650
court and they wanted the same things

190
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,330
you know at any time to be able to come

191
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:50,159
in and actually it's not that different

192
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:51,840
from other governments across the world

193
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,100
so if you take a look at the French

194
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,900
government the English government they

195
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,190
all want the same thing you know they

196
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,919
wanted to be able to come in they wanted

197
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:02,550
to have key escrow or other such like

198
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:05,790
huge repercussions types of capability

199
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:07,170
and as part of this you know in order to

200
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,430
do the kind of stuff that they wanted to

201
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:10,710
do it requires a certain amount of

202
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:12,270
magical thinking and those of you that

203
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,890
are familiar with it will understand why

204
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:17,190
because basically what they said is look

205
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:18,900
I want to be able to get into any type

206
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:21,510
of communications or communications

207
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:23,969
device at any time and I want to do that

208
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:26,130
maybe we can you know split the keys or

209
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:29,430
I get like this magical unicorn shaped

210
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:31,050
poopy golden key and with my golden key

211
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:33,330
when I have a court order I can just

212
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:36,150
unlock something and by the way nobody

213
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:39,180
else will find this master key just for

214
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:41,959
me how many of you believe that if you

215
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:44,579
do you really need to see me later so

216
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:49,080
the the clue is that this magical

217
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:50,690
thinking was not only to a few people

218
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,830
Evan

219
00:08:50,690 --> 00:09:26,430
[Music]

220
00:08:51,830 --> 00:09:42,570
get into the judges issue search

221
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:44,339
warrants for interception orders my

222
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:45,480
daughter's missing you know for fun what

223
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,730
do you mean you can't tell me who she

224
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,530
was texting with before she disappeared

225
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:51,750
now I keep saying folks is a democracy

226
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:53,370
should never drift maybe that's where we

227
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:55,020
want to go but I think we have a

228
00:09:53,370 --> 00:10:06,930
conversation in this country about where

229
00:09:55,020 --> 00:10:08,910
we go the Fourth Amendment that is

230
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:12,569
clearly in play and I follow it and I

231
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:14,430
get a third we need to discuss place we

232
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:16,620
can't get access so it's a huge feature

233
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:21,270
we're discussing sheriffs the Chiefs

234
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:24,770
raised in the country Child Exploitation

235
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:24,770
cases car wrecks

236
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:35,760
we have to talk about all right so

237
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,930
here's the deal guys uh it sounds really

238
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,580
rough right

239
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,620
you want to help this guy again commis

240
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,450
my homie now but at the time when he

241
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:44,040
said this I was like yeah right this is

242
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:49,500
a load of and why is it

243
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:52,290
 any ideas do you really need

244
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:56,480
Apple or Google to tell you who texted

245
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:56,480
who all right then

246
00:10:57,410 --> 00:11:02,170
exactly so do you need Apple or do you

247
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:04,420
need a tea and by the way

248
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:07,540
all of the lawful interception systems

249
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:09,880
at telecom networks are super mature and

250
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,709
can do this all the time and if you just

251
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:14,620
have access to iCloud you know that's a

252
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:17,020
different type of permissive action to

253
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:19,330
go ask if this stuff is backed up but

254
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:21,640
you just get it from there so again this

255
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:24,040
is and it's being sold to

256
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:28,000
senators who buy that and then

257
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:31,180
take it on board yes is it a question or

258
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,710
a comment ok leave it for later

259
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:36,489
you missed my intro when I said no

260
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:38,560
comments sorry no questions are for for

261
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:41,260
good so please ask questions but please

262
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,599
reserve your comments for later or talk

263
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:45,550
to me afterwards so yeah all right hey

264
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,920
listen the clue is that he had

265
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:50,069
alternatives so it wasn't just AT&T if

266
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,150
he really has something that is actually

267
00:11:50,070 --> 00:11:54,790
locally stored on the device there were

268
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:58,480
alternatives other than asking for the

269
00:11:54,790 --> 00:12:00,400
signing key to iOS and I'm Joe King you

270
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,110
know what isn't the FBI drop acid or get

271
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:06,310
lasered I'm kidding

272
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:07,450
I'm joking so but there are options that

273
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,250
he could have done you know he could

274
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:12,250
have tried to look at how he defeats the

275
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:14,440
secure Enclave or you know do some

276
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:16,780
actual decapping or actually figure out

277
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:19,510
with infrared laser glitching how to

278
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:20,290
strip off every layer and then do it

279
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,460
that way and I want to show you

280
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,250
something because there actually is a

281
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:25,690
video at the time this is all three and

282
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:40,480
a half years ago okay there was a sin

283
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:43,540
jenn market trick everything anything

284
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,120
ain't only the same but it's $100 more

285
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:48,760
if you buy a 16 gigabyte phone compared

286
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:52,000
to a 16 gigabytes and we have well now

287
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:55,150
curation to watch one day china and i

288
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,910
heard one man has challenged the aqua

289
00:12:55,150 --> 00:13:03,490
pricing strategy single ooh let's check

290
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:08,670
out what is so here is where all the

291
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:08,670
magic takes place all the magic fish

292
00:13:31,720 --> 00:14:25,000
so guys I'm like

293
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:37,730
[Music]

294
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:44,509
[Music]

295
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:56,669
[Music]

296
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:02,179
[Music]

297
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:16,669
[Music]

298
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:18,139
the point is this guy was able to do all

299
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:19,789
of this in a Shenzhen market for to

300
00:15:18,139 --> 00:15:21,319
pursue / cheap but he didn't require a

301
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:22,970
lot of user interaction in order to

302
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:25,069
actually get to the data on the song and

303
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:26,029
that's like kind of the point the FBI

304
00:15:25,069 --> 00:15:27,289
could have done the same thing they

305
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:28,910
could have asked the corporation of the

306
00:15:27,289 --> 00:15:31,369
NSA to lock it they didn't do any of

307
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,529
those things and instead try to figure

308
00:15:31,369 --> 00:15:37,100
out how they can just brute force this

309
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:38,509
access directly by demanding the most of

310
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,389
the that they could with Apple so it

311
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:43,279
wasn't really a question of is it the

312
00:15:41,389 --> 00:15:45,109
Apple versus FBI wasn't even a question

313
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:46,549
it says privacy versus security which is

314
00:15:45,109 --> 00:15:49,249
what a lot of people in the media made

315
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:52,220
it it was really question of you know

316
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:54,649
what rights do private companies have to

317
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:56,449
retain their Liberty versus the control

318
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:59,539
that's exercised by government in

319
00:15:56,449 --> 00:16:02,329
certain cases that is far beyond again

320
00:15:59,539 --> 00:16:04,549
it's action versus intent it goes far

321
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:06,258
beyond the original depth of powers that

322
00:16:04,549 --> 00:16:10,339
was given to them in order to promote

323
00:16:06,259 --> 00:16:12,230
and protect public safety so this is

324
00:16:10,339 --> 00:16:25,839
relevant because it actually causes some

325
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:25,839
unintended effects missing - oh my god

326
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:37,069
it's great have raised with them they've

327
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,499
got a couple of laws that are working

328
00:16:37,069 --> 00:16:45,069
their way through the system that would

329
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:48,459
essentially force all US companies to

330
00:16:45,069 --> 00:16:53,599
turn over to the Chinese government

331
00:16:48,459 --> 00:16:56,108
mechanisms where they could sue and keep

332
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,109
track out

333
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:40,820
stop-in because here's the deal

334
00:17:38,179 --> 00:17:42,679
there's no foreign government that's

335
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,230
gonna have the wholesale turning over of

336
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:46,670
data and this applies to China but it

337
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:49,730
equally applies of course to the United

338
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:51,559
States right so why wouldn't we demand

339
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:54,020
the same things from all governments and

340
00:17:51,559 --> 00:17:56,570
imagine this magic key of this golden

341
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:58,700
key again you'd have to basically split

342
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:01,189
your key your master key if you are

343
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,559
Apple or Google or whoever and you'd

344
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:05,120
have to give a master key to the Chinese

345
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:07,840
government you'd have to give a master

346
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,969
key to the American government so again

347
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,770
imagine what it would require for you to

348
00:18:10,970 --> 00:18:14,150
be able to do this well and for the

349
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:16,570
government to be able to do as well

350
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:20,780
you'd have to have like perfect

351
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:22,879
technical execution and flawless process

352
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:24,260
execution by these governments I want to

353
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:27,800
ask you have you ever seen a government

354
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:30,530
do anything with flawless execution so

355
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:32,450
these types of tasks are not something

356
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:33,860
that you want to just give to a

357
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,990
government and let them figure out how

358
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,820
to do it right and it comes back to this

359
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:40,520
initial idea you know you saw in the

360
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:42,020
James Comey video you talked about look

361
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,460
this is a real problem for the Fourth

362
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,980
Amendment for the Fourth Amendment is a

363
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:47,870
right to search and seizure but you also

364
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:50,000
have the Second Amendment

365
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:53,659
do you guys know it the Americans might

366
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:56,780
now it you know the Second Amendment the

367
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:58,460
right to bear arms so Americans have at

368
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:01,460
all times the right to bear arms and in

369
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:04,880
the original crypto Wars the reason

370
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:07,020
there was a war was because the State

371
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,890
Department of the United States had said

372
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:13,740
aaaghh Rafi is a weapon it's you cannot

373
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:16,620
just trade cryptography or give it to

374
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:18,929
countries without an export license from

375
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:21,899
the US State Department and all of the

376
00:19:18,929 --> 00:19:24,480
cryptographers said no cryptography

377
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,700
belongs in the public domain everyone

378
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,900
should have access to good crypto damn

379
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,520
it that was actually kind of dumb

380
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,260
because if it was a weapon we'd all have

381
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,300
the right to bear it and there would be

382
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:35,460
no way you could you know don't take

383
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,440
away my crypto would be like a Snowe

384
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,940
slogan instead of just the NRA kind of

385
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,960
thing you know crypto kills people I

386
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:45,330
don't know but em the clue is that

387
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:47,280
there's this great a kxe D comic about

388
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:49,199
it as well but cryptography protects way

389
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,940
more than just the bad guys who are

390
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,130
doing this terrorism in pedophilia as

391
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,530
you know you know free speech free trial

392
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:57,150
the right to dissent the ability to have

393
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:59,580
fair competition and intellectual

394
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:01,470
property etc etc etc so there's a wealth

395
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:03,510
of things why you want to protect your

396
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:07,679
cryptography and so like where does this

397
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:09,059
go from cryptography to quantum well we

398
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,890
need to talk about quantum a little bit

399
00:20:09,059 --> 00:20:13,740
first in order to kind of bridge that

400
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:15,179
gap the first thing is you know when I

401
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:16,679
originally got interested in quantum

402
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:18,840
moves because I was working on lawful

403
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:22,380
intercept systems so I was building

404
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:25,139
national lawful intercept networks in

405
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:27,510
order for governments with a warrant to

406
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:30,330
correctly be able to intercept only the

407
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:32,190
traffic needed not let the attacker know

408
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:34,050
they were doing any interception and

409
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:37,590
making sure that those systems were

410
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:41,428
fully an auditable accountable etc yeah

411
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:43,020
so um I had met someone who said you

412
00:20:41,429 --> 00:20:44,730
know that's all well and good but how do

413
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:46,290
you deal with it when you're dealing

414
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:48,059
with post quantum cryptography or

415
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:49,379
quantum key distribution and I said you

416
00:20:48,059 --> 00:20:51,389
know it doesn't matter you still capture

417
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:53,010
the traffic and then it's the count of

418
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:54,900
the government's to decrypt it later and

419
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:56,429
they usually have techniques and tactics

420
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:59,670
to do that they said well that does not

421
00:20:56,429 --> 00:21:01,559
work when it comes to qkd so I tried to

422
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:03,059
figure out how is this work and what you

423
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,710
see is when we talk about things that

424
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:06,540
are quantum we're all talking about all

425
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:08,580
things around quantum technologies and

426
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,530
in order to look at quantum we have to

427
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:13,050
kind of take our head away from where we

428
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:14,580
think about classical physics classical

429
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:17,490
physics is the study of macroscopic

430
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:19,559
things right big stuff big things big

431
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,970
reactions that we can see when we talk

432
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,860
about

433
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:23,720
quantum it's really different it's all a

434
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,370
super super trouper small stuff and it's

435
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,740
really a different type of study so

436
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:32,209
quantum kind of emerged in the 1920s

437
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:33,740
with Niels Bohr and if you guys ever see

438
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:34,880
all that picture you know with Einstein

439
00:21:33,740 --> 00:21:36,680
sitting on the front row with all these

440
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,300
other scientists that was the Solveig

441
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:40,900
conference and that's kind of like the

442
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:43,879
seminal moment where Einstein and Bohr

443
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:46,610
started arguing about quantum mechanics

444
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:48,560
and quantum mechanics for a large extent

445
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:50,209
is very counterintuitive so you have you

446
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,860
know Fineman and you have more even

447
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:54,560
saying like if you really understand it

448
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:56,149
or if hasn't completely shocked you you

449
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,740
don't really understand it and if you

450
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:59,900
think you understand you don't really um

451
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:01,790
because of that counterintuitive miss

452
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,410
and what you should know is that it's

453
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:05,420
not about something like where you have

454
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:08,000
an action and a reaction a highly

455
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:10,790
deterministic outcome but you have

456
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,580
something happen and probably something

457
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:15,740
else could follow okay so in order to

458
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:17,449
study some of these effects you also are

459
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:19,850
talking about super super super cooling

460
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:21,440
the particles the subatomic particles in

461
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:24,080
order to be able to study how they

462
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,450
interact meet each other have I confused

463
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:29,629
you all thoroughly yet no damn it all

464
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:32,570
right give me some time so when we talk

465
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:34,730
about quantum and we try to figure out

466
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:37,460
how we do quantum information science we

467
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:40,370
look at writing information on quantum

468
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:42,620
bits or qubits and you know you guys all

469
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:45,919
know binary that's 0 and 1 right

470
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:49,790
well quantum bits or qubits are the 0

471
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:52,750
and the 1 at the same time they they

472
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:54,590
exist in this like superposition state

473
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:56,870
continuously okay so they're

474
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:59,030
continuously this and only when you

475
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:01,520
actually do a measurement do they

476
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:04,490
indicate whether they are a 0 and a 1 so

477
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,379
there are 0 and 1 in all terms until you

478
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:09,500
do a measurement and then they flip one

479
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:13,280
way or the other clear okay

480
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:15,500
all right good and entanglement is this

481
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,170
principle that actually gives a quantum

482
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,510
computer which has a lot of these qubits

483
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:23,090
scale and the reason it does that is

484
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:24,650
this is how we link the individual

485
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:27,050
qubits which are existing in this

486
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:28,790
superposition state to each other so

487
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:31,010
you'll have a 0 and a 1 and when you

488
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:32,090
want to couple it with another 0 to 1 so

489
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,200
let's say I have a qubit that's

490
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,179
positioned like this

491
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:38,240
in order for me to entangle I basically

492
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:40,250
flip the bits right and then I entangle

493
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:43,970
these two to the other side when the

494
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:46,160
result is zero of mixing this with this

495
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:50,450
then I know that they've been properly

496
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:53,930
entangled okay clear still confused

497
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:56,630
anyone yet okay so entanglement gives

498
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:58,700
these quantum computers scale because of

499
00:23:56,630 --> 00:24:02,900
the following reason think about it this

500
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:05,420
way when I'm binary I can be a 0 or 1 so

501
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:08,030
if you write something on this binary

502
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:11,630
state you write it in one of these two

503
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:14,149
states right but when I write it in a

504
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:19,610
cubed you have to think that it's 2 to

505
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:22,670
the N alright so if I M where n is the

506
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:26,899
number of qubits so if I have one qubit

507
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:28,460
and it's due to the N it's ladder guys

508
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,840
come on this I know we haven't had

509
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:33,100
coffee but come on

510
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:39,580
alright two to the N where n is one is

511
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:44,149
good to the N 1 and is 3 when n is 4

512
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:46,939
when n is 5 here's the deal this is an

513
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:49,340
exponential thing so because of this

514
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:53,450
exponential capability with only very

515
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:56,899
few qubits I have tons of space to write

516
00:24:53,450 --> 00:25:00,140
on in the same spot where I had this one

517
00:24:56,900 --> 00:25:04,010
binary probability of like the 0 or the

518
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:06,260
1 if I have 2 to the X or n where I have

519
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:08,840
multiple qubits entangle to each other I

520
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:12,170
have this exponentially increasing space

521
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:15,709
to write my information this is the

522
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:17,120
power of quantum computing so the idea

523
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:19,490
is you have these qubits

524
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:21,709
you entangle them together when you've

525
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:24,680
achieved that you have this massive

526
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:26,840
amount of space to write all of these

527
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:29,330
possibilities are we clear

528
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:31,159
do we understand how cool and kick-ass

529
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:34,780
quantum computing is just from this

530
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:37,070
principle all right ok problem with

531
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:39,320
entanglement Einstein didn't believe it

532
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:42,230
he called it spooky action at a distance

533
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:44,960
he said this is you know God

534
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:45,720
does not play dice he won't give you

535
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,330
this problem

536
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:51,150
allistic outcome you cannot tell me that

537
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:54,179
you can combine things over an arbitrary

538
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:58,110
distance have them so coupled that a

539
00:25:54,180 --> 00:26:00,360
flip on the one entangled side photon

540
00:25:58,110 --> 00:26:02,040
side will result in a flip in the other

541
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,540
side no way

542
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:08,760
doesn't happen and why doesn't it happen

543
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:10,590
anyone know hell yes

544
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:12,720
thank you we talked about less much but

545
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:14,840
it violates relativity because this is

546
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:23,040
happening faster than the speed of light

547
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:25,139
okay what no there is so that's right

548
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,790
this is the thing all right so here's

549
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:29,040
the deal there are scientists at the TU

550
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:30,810
delft who when I presented this paper

551
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,980
was only a few months after they did

552
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:33,389
this there was an article published in

553
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:35,430
Nature you can still google it now

554
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:38,820
there's a great YouTube video please go

555
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:41,640
look okay it's all about the loophole

556
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:44,970
free bail test and what they did is this

557
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:47,220
test across this university campus with

558
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:48,870
two diamonds and what they've done is

559
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:50,250
they've taken the electrons in these

560
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,750
diamonds they've entangled them then

561
00:26:50,250 --> 00:26:53,820
they had photons added to the mix

562
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:56,460
entangled those and then they did this

563
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:59,040
swap test across the distance of this

564
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:01,020
university campus and what they saw is

565
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:04,020
that faster than the speed of light on

566
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:07,590
multiple tests and also validated and

567
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:09,930
verified by other scientists you had

568
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:13,169
this loophole three tests would always

569
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:16,380
resulted in this spooky action being

570
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:19,110
verified and basically proving Einstein

571
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:22,560
wrong there is something that goes

572
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:25,469
faster than the speed of light in this

573
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,970
thing we don't know how we don't know

574
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:29,040
how the hell they're managing to

575
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:31,650
communicate across this arbitrary

576
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,450
distance we don't understand it and we

577
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:35,520
can't explain it but we can observe it

578
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:38,550
we can see that it's happening and that

579
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:42,300
it's been validated this is crazy scary

580
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:45,270
take a and the result of which

581
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:47,669
means that because of the power that we

582
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:49,050
give from a quantum computer you know we

583
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,820
saw Moore's law right everybody

584
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:52,889
remembers Moore's law yes

585
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,899
but now what we're seeing is am dollz

586
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:57,450
laws which is you keep adding processing

587
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:58,340
and power or you keep adding chips but

588
00:27:57,450 --> 00:28:00,230
you don't have the

589
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,658
sorry increase in processing power so

590
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:04,220
what you're seeing is a sort of

591
00:28:01,659 --> 00:28:05,990
parabolic shift downwards instead of

592
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:08,419
this continuously increasing exponential

593
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:11,870
effect of Moore's you're seeing Amdahl's

594
00:28:08,419 --> 00:28:13,520
kind of going not so much and because of

595
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:15,080
Amdahl's law and our decreasing

596
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:17,960
processing power we basically need

597
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:20,299
alternatives to still get our high for

598
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:22,340
our computing resources so there is no

599
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:24,889
alternative other than to look at

600
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:26,870
quantum computers by the way I have to

601
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:29,120
be very clear quantum computers are not

602
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:30,739
there for you to like do little cool

603
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:34,189
funky things they're really there for

604
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:36,860
scientific analysis and very specific

605
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:38,860
types of problem sets so it's not going

606
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:42,740
to make your home computer any faster

607
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:44,870
okay and and what we see is that there's

608
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,610
like before we even thought about having

609
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:49,428
a quantum computer we already had two

610
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:51,439
algorithm shores and Grover's sure does

611
00:28:49,429 --> 00:28:53,450
integer factorization everybody remember

612
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,179
their high school math remember what

613
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:59,870
integer factorization is okay good and

614
00:28:56,179 --> 00:29:02,720
you will not remember don't be shy okay

615
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:04,729
you raise your hand in the back good ok

616
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,370
all the people who are cool and say they

617
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:09,559
did remember at what you know claimed to

618
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:20,000
be cool and someone tell them what

619
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:23,840
injured factorization is please okay

620
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:28,630
that I'm gonna help you so like let's

621
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:32,809
take a like um pick a number

622
00:29:28,630 --> 00:29:35,390
sure 34 so we know that like there are

623
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:36,980
certain things that get to 34 right so

624
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:43,520
what are all the integers that will get

625
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:48,830
us 34 huh - right but what else one in

626
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:50,929
33 okay so here's the deal right that's

627
00:29:48,830 --> 00:30:00,408
how we get it but for cryptography this

628
00:29:50,929 --> 00:30:02,390
is relevant why very good so the idea is

629
00:30:00,409 --> 00:30:04,940
with crypto cryptography we're always

630
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:06,320
using very large primes right with and

631
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:07,789
what we're trying to figure out is when

632
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,230
you have these very large Prime's we

633
00:30:07,789 --> 00:30:12,200
multiply them together and we get the

634
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:14,720
cipher text as a result as a product

635
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:17,450
these you know large primes we want

636
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,519
no-one to be able to factor back from

637
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:21,649
just having a sample of the encrypted

638
00:30:19,519 --> 00:30:23,929
traffic we don't want them to get to our

639
00:30:21,649 --> 00:30:25,279
original keys that is why integer

640
00:30:23,929 --> 00:30:28,760
factorization would be kind of like a

641
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:31,100
snag in that whole cryptography thing so

642
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,120
as a result of which we don't want

643
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:34,760
anyone to be able to do it so the

644
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:36,860
algorithm is there it's just waiting for

645
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:39,590
a quantum computer with enough entangled

646
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:42,350
qubits in order to be able to run short

647
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:44,480
and this is what the whole bloody planet

648
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:45,830
is working on right now to try to figure

649
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,710
that out the second thing you have is

650
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:50,600
Grover Grover's algorithm is doing the

651
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:52,669
optimization of large database searches

652
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,469
and so what Grover's gets to do is

653
00:30:52,669 --> 00:30:56,179
basically look at all of the possible

654
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:59,059
answers filter them all out

655
00:30:56,179 --> 00:31:02,450
simultaneously it basically runs all the

656
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:03,740
options at the same time that doesn't

657
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:05,870
blow your mind I don't know what will

658
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:07,789
but Grover's gets to do that so it just

659
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:09,469
tries all the outcomes at once and then

660
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:12,789
as a result of which figures out which

661
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:14,210
one is correct to solve the problem yeah

662
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:16,850
I'm sorry

663
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:20,059
yeah the P and NP problem yeah yes yes

664
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:21,559
so the the idea is because of shores and

665
00:31:20,059 --> 00:31:23,059
Grover's attached to a quantum computer

666
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:24,769
instead of looking at all the

667
00:31:23,059 --> 00:31:26,418
opportunities look there are some really

668
00:31:24,769 --> 00:31:28,580
cool opportunities we could do

669
00:31:26,419 --> 00:31:31,429
personalized medicine we can cure cancer

670
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:33,439
we can do protein folding stuff we can

671
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:35,870
figure out I don't know

672
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,700
new fuels and nanotechnology we can do

673
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:39,168
all kinds of scientific modeling on a

674
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:41,510
quantum computer which could potentially

675
00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:44,149
you know save the human race from the

676
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:48,470
cesspit that we are currently in but um

677
00:31:44,149 --> 00:31:51,889
the downside is it breaks crypto okay

678
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:53,539
pretty bad and everybody all over the

679
00:31:51,889 --> 00:31:55,370
planet is in on this quantum race

680
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:56,539
everybody wants to get there first

681
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:59,989
because there's a huge strategic

682
00:31:56,539 --> 00:32:03,230
advantage of reading everybody else's

683
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:05,149
secrets so one of the solutions and the

684
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:07,639
one that I initially got interested in

685
00:32:05,149 --> 00:32:09,379
was quantum key distribution so we all

686
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:11,539
know Alice and Bob they're our friends

687
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:14,299
right so when Alice wants to talk to Bob

688
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:17,210
bless you and she uses a quantum Channel

689
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:19,340
which is just a fiber-optic cable that's

690
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:21,169
lights quantum so there's so many

691
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:22,879
quantum of text you know photosynthesis

692
00:32:21,169 --> 00:32:24,559
is a quantum effect everything is

693
00:32:22,879 --> 00:32:26,240
quantum all over us

694
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:28,730
the clue is that alice is gonna talk to

695
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,259
Bob over a fiber-optic channel what

696
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:33,879
she's worried about is the presence of

697
00:32:30,259 --> 00:32:36,259
Eve what she wants to do is basically

698
00:32:33,879 --> 00:32:37,759
figure out if Eve is there and this

699
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:39,110
simple picture looks slightly more

700
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:41,210
complicated but not that much

701
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:42,649
everybody knows what a polarizer is

702
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:45,440
right everybody has polarized sunglasses

703
00:32:42,649 --> 00:32:47,120
at least once ok so this is basically

704
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,919
like a more expensive polarized

705
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,689
sunglasses all right what we do is we

706
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:54,580
take the light and when we orient it

707
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:57,799
through our polarisers we shift the

708
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:59,840
qubits in a particular orientation ok

709
00:32:57,799 --> 00:33:01,460
the the single photon that we've sent

710
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,610
through that thing is polarized in a

711
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:08,330
particular orientation we set up Alice's

712
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:11,449
polarisers in a particular config we

713
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:14,149
tell Bob via a secondary out of bound

714
00:33:11,450 --> 00:33:15,590
and that can use classic cryptography

715
00:33:14,149 --> 00:33:17,629
which is one of the reasons a lot of

716
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:19,699
cryptographers hate this by the way but

717
00:33:17,629 --> 00:33:21,949
and so we use classic cryptography to

718
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:25,129
tell Bob how alice has configured her

719
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:29,090
polarisers Bob then configures his

720
00:33:25,129 --> 00:33:33,009
polarisers in order to receive it if Eve

721
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:36,320
is trying to read Alice's bit sequence

722
00:33:33,009 --> 00:33:38,929
she it up because she's

723
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:41,269
interrupting it and there's no way to

724
00:33:38,929 --> 00:33:42,950
measure without changing that's one of

725
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:45,769
the principles of qualm because of this

726
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:47,480
no cloning effect either she can't copy

727
00:33:45,769 --> 00:33:51,409
it you can't change it you can't monitor

728
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:53,690
it that sequence gets shifted so if Eve

729
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:56,570
is on the line even when they're using

730
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:59,840
the right config on both sides Bob will

731
00:33:56,570 --> 00:34:02,629
get complete crap okay that's how they

732
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:05,330
know this lining is no longer secure we

733
00:34:02,629 --> 00:34:06,740
have to do something else and you know

734
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:08,210
there's some issues with this when you

735
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:10,310
have to do this over fiber because fiber

736
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:12,859
has distance limitations you can't go

737
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:14,659
more than 64 kilometers so how many of

738
00:34:12,859 --> 00:34:16,819
you communicate every once in a while

739
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:19,879
with people who are further than 64

740
00:34:16,819 --> 00:34:22,279
kilometers away from you kind of a small

741
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:23,719
snag right so we can't use it

742
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:26,149
effectively but there's this possibility

743
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:27,739
of free space quantum so there was this

744
00:34:26,149 --> 00:34:30,020
experiment that was already done three

745
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:31,459
years ago Paula Villa Daisy Italian

746
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:33,520
researcher dude from university of

747
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:35,020
padova basically put a quantum Li

748
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,449
between Las Palmas and Tenerife in the

749
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:41,980
Canary Islands in Europe basically he

750
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:43,178
had that big-ass laser shooting from one

751
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:44,918
observation point to the other

752
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:46,659
observational point and he managed to

753
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:48,908
get a pretty stable thing even with the

754
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:50,350
water vapor and everything it was pretty

755
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:53,830
stable so he managed to have a fully

756
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:56,500
encrypted link over this laser that was

757
00:34:53,830 --> 00:35:00,340
pretty damn cool no more 64 kilometers

758
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:02,620
this is 144 you know but I don't think

759
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:03,520
it's a solution all the time and we'll

760
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:06,370
explain why in a minute

761
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:10,170
the other thing that you can do is say

762
00:35:06,370 --> 00:35:13,060
okay our algorithm specifically like RSA

763
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:15,520
all of the elliptic curve is

764
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:17,830
screwed because of these factoring

765
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:19,780
possibilities from Shore and Grover so

766
00:35:17,830 --> 00:35:21,670
what we should do is move over to a new

767
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:23,500
set of algorithms where even when you

768
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:25,570
have a quantum computer they're still

769
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:29,830
unbreakable and we've had MEC Elise

770
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:31,870
already since 1978 so we've had a post

771
00:35:29,830 --> 00:35:33,819
quantum algorithm that could totally

772
00:35:31,870 --> 00:35:35,589
still work today except you know you

773
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:38,590
have to optimize it you know it's still

774
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:42,010
MP hard the worry is that without it you

775
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:44,710
will always have a problem okay and the

776
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:47,770
NSA also did the sweet b from august

777
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:50,230
2015 to recommend that everybody in the

778
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:52,360
government already transition to that

779
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:54,400
new set of algorithms schneier talked

780
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,230
about it and you know I had this this

781
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:00,910
was my closing slide in the flashback

782
00:35:56,230 --> 00:36:02,980
tract but here's the deal since I spoke

783
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:04,690
to you guys last every slide you just

784
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:07,210
saw was the exact set of slides I used

785
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:10,270
at the last time but since that I spoke

786
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:13,750
to you Schrodinger's cat got a bit

787
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:16,930
bigger and the space that occupies the

788
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:19,540
quantum space is everywhere so there is

789
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:23,080
no one I talk to that's not doing

790
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:26,590
something now in quantum and that's

791
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:28,779
different so when you take a look at

792
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:31,540
what's happening in the world agencies

793
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:34,030
haven't stopped hacking you know we like

794
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:36,190
one crys the latest in a series of

795
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:38,800
from the hardware stuff and the Super

796
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:40,720
Micro crap I mean we're all still doing

797
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,150
the same different day right

798
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:45,370
none of the modus operandi well they've

799
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:46,609
they've gotten a bit more you know they

800
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:49,430
need a

801
00:36:46,609 --> 00:36:51,529
demands more ingrained but like I was

802
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:52,879
showing Dylan outside today like we just

803
00:36:51,529 --> 00:36:54,200
saw thunderclap so it's continuously

804
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,660
gonna go on we're not stopping it now

805
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,910
what we do these days though is we out

806
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:01,819
the bad guys so we take photos of the

807
00:36:58,910 --> 00:37:03,470
spies we put it on Twitter and your news

808
00:37:01,819 --> 00:37:06,170
media and we say these are Russian GRU

809
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:09,348
agents there were in Amsterdam to go and

810
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:12,410
try to tap into the OPCW we didn't do

811
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:14,690
that before so that's new and and what

812
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:17,598
you also should know which is new is

813
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:19,519
that China in the last couple of years

814
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,519
also launched the world's first quantum

815
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:23,598
communication satellite and unlike every

816
00:37:22,519 --> 00:37:26,598
other country on the planet

817
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:30,470
they built a 2,000 kilometer long fully

818
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:32,259
quantum trusted node network across the

819
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:33,649
length of China from Beijing to Shanghai

820
00:37:32,259 --> 00:37:37,309
 hell

821
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:38,809
that is so serious and there's no other

822
00:37:37,309 --> 00:37:40,640
country that's able to do this type of

823
00:37:38,809 --> 00:37:42,920
effort just purely from an engineering

824
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,660
standpoint let alone from a financial

825
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,339
and everything else so they are way

826
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:48,109
ahead of everybody else just because

827
00:37:46,339 --> 00:37:51,440
that their communications from a

828
00:37:48,109 --> 00:37:53,839
national perspective cannot be tapped at

829
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,430
all so although you know they're

830
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:57,859
perfectly instead of potentially doing

831
00:37:55,430 --> 00:38:00,890
things to other people their own OPSEC

832
00:37:57,859 --> 00:38:02,538
is pretty darn good when you want to

833
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:04,160
examine for yourselves though the power

834
00:38:02,539 --> 00:38:06,200
potential of a quantum computer you have

835
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:07,848
to first think like how long do you need

836
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:09,529
to keep your cryptography or your data

837
00:38:07,849 --> 00:38:11,989
or whatever how long do you need to keep

838
00:38:09,529 --> 00:38:13,190
their stuff secure any ideas how long do

839
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:18,499
you need to keep your data secure any

840
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:20,900
ideas here 18 months well that's gonna

841
00:38:18,499 --> 00:38:22,160
be and but like what about your medical

842
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:25,640
health data what about everybody who's

843
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:27,319
doing ancestry.com data or your DNA data

844
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:29,538
that you're sending off to 23andme or

845
00:38:27,319 --> 00:38:31,640
your health and medical records that you

846
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:34,579
leave at local hospitals or how long

847
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:37,098
does that need to be secure yeah so we

848
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:39,440
don't know how to do that we do not know

849
00:38:37,099 --> 00:38:42,349
how to secure your data for a lifetime

850
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,910
let's just start from there okay how

851
00:38:42,349 --> 00:38:45,650
long before there's a viable quantum

852
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:53,089
computer that breaks into our secrets

853
00:38:45,650 --> 00:38:55,690
any ideas who have any 12 to 20 where

854
00:38:53,089 --> 00:38:55,690
did you get that number

855
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:59,530
[Music]

856
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:07,470
okay so I think that's that's like a

857
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:09,869
that you're in the mid-range but I would

858
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:12,899
say I just did a ran study on this so

859
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:15,119
the most optimistic estimate is five

860
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:17,010
years and that the research that's

861
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:19,170
actually like saying that it's five

862
00:39:17,010 --> 00:39:20,490
years is not in the public domain so

863
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:21,990
these are state-sponsored attackers

864
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:23,399
working on this like they would have

865
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:25,560
worked on the Manhattan Project they've

866
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,210
taken a bunch of scientists and their

867
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,279
families they have moved them to a

868
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:32,460
reservation where they are working in

869
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:35,130
complete and utter secrecy as a national

870
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:42,270
strategic objective so that's the five

871
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:44,460
years excuse me well well this is not so

872
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:46,020
scary but it's probably a realistic

873
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:47,880
possibility in some countries who have

874
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:49,200
the investment opportunity and the

875
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:52,170
availability to attract these type of

876
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,339
scientists the issue is attracting these

877
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:54,810
scientists because the majority of

878
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,670
scientists want to work in the public

879
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:59,549
domain the ones that are really good

880
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:03,210
with this stuff do so um here's the deal

881
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:05,100
so five is hyper optimistic I think and

882
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:07,290
then you have this extrapolation of you

883
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:09,299
know never will have cold fusion before

884
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:10,920
we ever have a proper viable quantum

885
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:14,010
computer that's actually capable of

886
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:15,359
breaking our crypto and then the last

887
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:17,010
question is how long do we need to

888
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:19,080
transition our networking systems

889
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:21,900
to one that's quantum safe like how long

890
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:26,609
would India need to go all quantum safe

891
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:28,710
with all her algorithms okay so let me

892
00:40:26,609 --> 00:40:34,020
just ask how's that ipv6 thing coming

893
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:36,900
along we suck at speed our whole problem

894
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:40,259
has always been one of speed we need to

895
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:43,410
get better faster in order to be smarter

896
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:44,880
with this stuff so when it look at when

897
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:46,410
you look at you know like what is the

898
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:48,000
real threat when it comes to algorithmic

899
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:49,799
stuff and we're looking at breaking

900
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,869
stuff where we used to say okay look it

901
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,130
takes a lifetime of the universe to

902
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:55,500
break some of the algorithms we have

903
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:57,869
we're talking about a matter of seconds

904
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,100
so we need that phase plan of defense

905
00:40:57,869 --> 00:41:02,010
first and foremost

906
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:03,868
everybody wherever you use crypto across

907
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:06,480
your network for whatever purpose you

908
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:08,220
use it you have a key length okay you

909
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,690
probably have optimized that key length

910
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:12,870
to not use the maximum

911
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:16,740
key size size matters here gentlemen

912
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:18,390
size definitely matters so make sure I'm

913
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:22,379
just kidding come on

914
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:23,759
so make sure you use the optimum key leg

915
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,380
like the maximum key length that's

916
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,520
affordable to you under all of the

917
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:28,440
algorithms you have running in your

918
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:30,600
network the second thing is look for

919
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:32,820
options to use quantum key distribution

920
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,319
because there are some like you know

921
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:36,390
probably a primary and secondary data

922
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:39,420
center where it's a viable alternative

923
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:41,040
it is not viable across your network but

924
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:43,170
there might be very specific points

925
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:47,130
where you would have a case to worry

926
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:50,580
it's there okay and what I believe in is

927
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:52,530
using these things in Union you're they

928
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:53,670
use multiple things at the same time so

929
00:41:52,530 --> 00:41:55,470
you don't just say okay I'll let me do

930
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:57,030
this but you do a staggered effort based

931
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:58,560
on what's available and this is

932
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:01,290
off-the-shelf technology so you can

933
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,820
easily set up a qkd link with no problem

934
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:05,490
it'll take you a week to set up and

935
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:07,020
finally look at post quantum algorithms

936
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:08,729
you know they're gonna come out of Miss

937
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:10,710
but don't wait for this to come out just

938
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:13,110
try your own again there's a huge issue

939
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:14,580
of capture now and decrypt later it's a

940
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:17,220
real picture of the NSA data center

941
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:18,990
facility in Utah where they make huge

942
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:20,700
copies of all kinds of traffic that's

943
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:22,529
running across the internet and this is

944
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:24,839
nonfiction so they actually make copies

945
00:42:22,530 --> 00:42:27,120
a lot of governments capture traffic and

946
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:29,580
keep it for quite some time and the

947
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:31,560
fundamental thing is old secrets are

948
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:33,810
sometimes just as interesting as new

949
00:42:31,560 --> 00:42:36,840
ones because there's a certain amount of

950
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:39,090
predictive force where if you have the

951
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:41,610
old secret at your disposal you can kind

952
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:42,630
of extrapolate other characteristics

953
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:45,930
that would allow you to hack things

954
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:48,540
later okay what we did is we started

955
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:52,350
with toe dip in the water by creating

956
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:54,090
our own quantum link between the hague

957
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:56,310
and rotterdam between two data centers

958
00:42:54,090 --> 00:42:58,530
and there was a distance that we did now

959
00:42:56,310 --> 00:43:00,660
we're building a fully quantum Internet

960
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:02,160
backbone across four nodes in the

961
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:04,310
country we're working with universities

962
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,270
to do it it'll be completed by 2021 I

963
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:07,740
think this is really cool

964
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:09,270
because we actually have quantum

965
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:12,240
computers on other sides of these links

966
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:14,460
so it's truly fully quantum it's not the

967
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:16,229
trusted node set up that we have

968
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:19,110
everywhere else because the trusted node

969
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:21,390
is just you know it's Alice to Bob Bob

970
00:43:19,110 --> 00:43:22,510
to Charlie and Charlie to thingy so when

971
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,190
you need to have a full

972
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:27,820
chain of trust when Alice wants to

973
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:29,980
communicate with Zed it's gonna be

974
00:43:27,820 --> 00:43:31,930
really really difficult unless she has

975
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:34,450
to you know flip every time between all

976
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:36,819
of these intermediary hops this will be

977
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:39,939
fully end to end because it's going to

978
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:42,130
use entanglement as a property to get a

979
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:43,900
quantum repeater which doesn't exist yet

980
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:45,790
so that means we can bridge those

981
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:47,650
distance limitations we have on fiber

982
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:51,730
and we have the potential to build a

983
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:54,910
brand new form of Internet a blueprint

984
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:56,140
for a quantum internet where the basis

985
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:58,420
of your telecommunications

986
00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:02,310
infrastructure will be fully encrypted

987
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:05,050
by default the feds are scared shitless

988
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:06,850
this is what it really looks like so

989
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:10,150
this is not common off-the-shelf

990
00:44:06,850 --> 00:44:11,620
technology yet so where you have a

991
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:13,330
quantum key distribution trusted node

992
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:17,200
Network you can just buy it and plug in

993
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:19,390
your rack this is not rackable what you

994
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:22,419
see is qkd is being used now to support

995
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:24,279
military operations and for critical

996
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:26,290
infrastructure continuity purposes and

997
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:28,060
this is a concern because I don't think

998
00:44:26,290 --> 00:44:29,710
this is the only realm of operations

999
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:32,410
what I do think would be really

1000
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:34,960
interesting is this is a picture of the

1001
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:36,670
star link setup from Elon Musk I think

1002
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:39,850
that there might be actual opportunities

1003
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:41,950
to think about using qkd from space in

1004
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:44,319
between these satellites why do you

1005
00:44:41,950 --> 00:44:51,100
think qkd from space to earth sucks any

1006
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:53,680
idea what that's a beautiful answer but

1007
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:56,290
the real answer is you can't use a

1008
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:58,930
quantum link from space to earth when

1009
00:44:56,290 --> 00:45:02,290
there's sunlight or when it rains and

1010
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:04,960
sometimes there's sunlight like you know

1011
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:06,310
half of the day and the other time you

1012
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,950
know every once in a while there's rain

1013
00:45:06,310 --> 00:45:10,960
so atmospheric disturbances allow any

1014
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:13,540
quantum link that goes from space to a

1015
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:16,030
ground station to be problematic but in

1016
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:18,009
between the vacuum of space to use a

1017
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:20,050
fully encrypted link is an awesome

1018
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:23,290
bloody possibility think about it fully

1019
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:26,350
meshed awesome quantum network there so

1020
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:29,230
I'm if anybody knows a LAN hit me up I

1021
00:45:26,350 --> 00:45:32,049
want to like pray at the altar of mr.

1022
00:45:29,230 --> 00:45:34,309
musk and and like let him know about

1023
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:37,339
this idea to do this all right

1024
00:45:34,309 --> 00:45:40,190
anyway post quantum standards they're

1025
00:45:37,339 --> 00:45:44,270
only gonna be available by 2024 don't

1026
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:47,089
wait for them start playing now so what

1027
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:48,950
we do is we have our own little team at

1028
00:45:47,089 --> 00:45:52,549
C's o lab so you might have you might

1029
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:57,169
know Phil Zimmerman he wrote PGP Phil is

1030
00:45:52,549 --> 00:45:58,880
in my team so I'm very lucky um but you

1031
00:45:57,170 --> 00:46:02,030
know he's in my team he listens to no

1032
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:04,760
one it's a mess anyway and so Phil is

1033
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:07,160
leading our post quantum efforts so what

1034
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:08,569
we've done is we have a PhD in post

1035
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:10,460
quantum and in chronic immune occations

1036
00:46:08,569 --> 00:46:12,020
we have dedicated resources we work with

1037
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:14,569
universities and we basically build a

1038
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:16,759
fully post quantum implementation of the

1039
00:46:14,569 --> 00:46:18,440
VPN and we want to make it part of the

1040
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:19,809
standard Linux distribution so it's open

1041
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:22,040
source and available to everybody else

1042
00:46:19,809 --> 00:46:24,500
we also are working on a post quantum

1043
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:29,829
version of SSH and pretty soon we'll

1044
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:33,140
have a post quantum version of PGP so

1045
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:35,240
yeah and we have a timeline for that and

1046
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:38,598
we're starting it like we've already

1047
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:40,729
finished with the VPN it's finishing and

1048
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:43,309
we're using khyber which is still in the

1049
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:45,020
running as a mist standard that's what

1050
00:46:43,309 --> 00:46:46,730
we're hoping it gets you know we think

1051
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:48,440
it has a high possibility but we have a

1052
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:50,420
high degree of crypto agility so if it

1053
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,970
doesn't become the standard we can swap

1054
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:54,950
it out and put another one in and then

1055
00:46:52,970 --> 00:46:57,109
post quantum SSH stuff we spoke to the

1056
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:59,450
guy you know what's his name the dude

1057
00:46:57,109 --> 00:47:02,390
who started SSH and he wants to work

1058
00:46:59,450 --> 00:47:06,439
with us that's good and we are planning

1059
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:08,720
the whole stuff around PGP so for all of

1060
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:10,430
you if mature eyes those crypto assets

1061
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,470
think it through in terms of when you're

1062
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:14,629
gonna be ready look for that crypto

1063
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:16,069
agility in your own solutions engage

1064
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:18,440
your hardware and software people to get

1065
00:47:16,069 --> 00:47:19,970
their in order make sure you have

1066
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:22,579
all this stuff built in as a requirement

1067
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:24,109
in your supplier security annexes when

1068
00:47:22,579 --> 00:47:26,630
you do selection and you know all that

1069
00:47:24,109 --> 00:47:30,319
other stuff and make sure you start

1070
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:34,369
failing find out what doesn't work now

1071
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:36,049
don't wait for the standard find out

1072
00:47:34,369 --> 00:47:38,000
what doesn't work now so that when the

1073
00:47:36,049 --> 00:47:42,470
standard arrives you'll be totally ready

1074
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:45,230
to go and put it in place good here's

1075
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:47,660
the deal my job is CEO of kpn I have to

1076
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:50,049
make sure that we are trusted

1077
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:54,288
by our customers partners in society

1078
00:47:50,049 --> 00:47:57,230
that means I need to keep myself and our

1079
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:58,700
team valid and worthy of that trust we

1080
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:02,210
can only do it when we can guarantee

1081
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:03,919
that long-term secrecy so please like

1082
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:05,390
make sure you can do the same for your

1083
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:12,109
customers and partners and company

1084
00:48:05,390 --> 00:48:19,400
thanks guys thank you I think I'm out of

1085
00:48:12,109 --> 00:48:34,460
time but questions okay questions Wow

1086
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:36,680
really oh go ahead yes yeah then we're

1087
00:48:34,460 --> 00:48:39,289
all screwed yes

1088
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:42,230
no no okay no here's the deal right and

1089
00:48:39,289 --> 00:48:43,760
did you ever see like what was the movie

1090
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:47,780
with Alan Turing I forgot the name of it

1091
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:50,599
a beautiful mind or imitation game yeah

1092
00:48:47,780 --> 00:48:53,420
so do you so Alan Turing imitation game

1093
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:56,150
so he had the ability to crack enigma

1094
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:57,859
right so here's the deal do you think

1095
00:48:56,150 --> 00:49:02,450
that the English ran out and told

1096
00:48:57,859 --> 00:49:04,460
everyone look I can break your stuff no

1097
00:49:02,450 --> 00:49:06,109
and you know I've been to our

1098
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:08,750
intelligence services in the Netherlands

1099
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:10,190
and in the they have a little Museum in

1100
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,730
the front it's really funny as the

1101
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:14,450
following

1102
00:49:10,730 --> 00:49:17,990
they used the Enigma machines to

1103
00:49:14,450 --> 00:49:19,339
actually encrypt traffic you know far

1104
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:21,970
beyond I won't tell you the date because

1105
00:49:19,339 --> 00:49:25,099
I don't embarrass anyone but far beyond

1106
00:49:21,970 --> 00:49:26,629
World War two because the British didn't

1107
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:28,279
let them know that they can read their

1108
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:31,069
stuff they were like yeah in fact the

1109
00:49:28,279 --> 00:49:34,369
British recovered Enigma devices gave it

1110
00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:37,038
to the Allies their allies and said use

1111
00:49:34,369 --> 00:49:39,529
this it's really good crypto we got it

1112
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:42,470
from the Germans super good stuff okay

1113
00:49:39,529 --> 00:49:44,029
so they gave it to their allies knowing

1114
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:45,770
full and well that they could read their

1115
00:49:44,029 --> 00:49:46,940
traffic and I think that this is the

1116
00:49:45,770 --> 00:49:49,130
same thing you're gonna keep your

1117
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:50,660
strategic advantage here to read

1118
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:52,579
everyone else's secrets as long as

1119
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:57,879
possible so as long as you can keep it

1120
00:49:52,579 --> 00:49:57,880
out of the public realm the better yep

1121
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:02,740
yep

1122
00:50:04,609 --> 00:50:10,109
by its five to never the most optimistic

1123
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:19,800
is five

1124
00:50:10,109 --> 00:50:21,810
oh you mean well so so look dude okay so

1125
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:24,440
I gotta tell you maybe where I get my

1126
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:26,880
information from so I'm on the EU

1127
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:29,430
committee to do all things quantum so

1128
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:33,569
the EU flagship and I'm also on the Etsy

1129
00:50:29,430 --> 00:50:35,578
post quantum team so being an Etsy and

1130
00:50:33,569 --> 00:50:36,810
the EU I have access to some of the best

1131
00:50:35,579 --> 00:50:37,650
people in the field and this is what

1132
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:40,828
they tell me

1133
00:50:37,650 --> 00:50:42,390
so it's also a little bit of holding

1134
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:44,760
between friends about what do you think

1135
00:50:42,390 --> 00:50:46,560
what do you think and you know it's like

1136
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:50,099
the Microsoft guys are doing so much

1137
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:52,500
work Google it has multiple bets on a on

1138
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:54,660
a quantum computer so it really depends

1139
00:50:52,500 --> 00:51:05,359
and like I mean there's some amazing

1140
00:50:54,660 --> 00:51:09,540
people working on this stuff from yeah

1141
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:25,319
yeah yeah well the NSA announcing Swede

1142
00:51:09,540 --> 00:51:26,430
be yeah yeah well so in the Snowden

1143
00:51:25,319 --> 00:51:29,190
documents one of the Snowden documents

1144
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:30,359
were actually referred to a quantum

1145
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:31,710
computer but at the time they were

1146
00:51:30,359 --> 00:51:33,779
looking at trying to develop something

1147
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:37,500
of like eight or nine qubits that is

1148
00:51:33,780 --> 00:51:40,319
nothing you know so that is like okay

1149
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:42,480
but it's not monumental so trying to get

1150
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:44,009
that far and that was 2009 maybe they're

1151
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:45,390
a bit further but they're still nowhere

1152
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:47,550
near the range that I've seen in some

1153
00:51:45,390 --> 00:51:50,368
universities and the biggest problem

1154
00:51:47,550 --> 00:51:52,440
look to build a quantum computer it's

1155
00:51:50,369 --> 00:51:54,359
not just having good engineering it's

1156
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:58,589
also like there's a certain amount of

1157
00:51:54,359 --> 00:52:04,020
finicky nests and and demonstrable

1158
00:51:58,589 --> 00:52:06,560
amount of static in the noise and where

1159
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:08,849
it is so you have these super super cold

1160
00:52:06,560 --> 00:52:10,500
environments you know it's like they're

1161
00:52:08,849 --> 00:52:11,940
the scientists that are there that are

1162
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:13,859
working on the quantum computers we're

1163
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:15,269
talking about freezing things colder

1164
00:52:13,859 --> 00:52:17,578
than outer space in order to

1165
00:52:15,269 --> 00:52:19,198
them in the lab and when you build

1166
00:52:17,579 --> 00:52:21,269
qubits there's all different types of

1167
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:23,459
topology you know there's a quantum dots

1168
00:52:21,269 --> 00:52:25,198
there's like this mesh ruby thing

1169
00:52:23,459 --> 00:52:26,368
there's you can do this on diamonds so

1170
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:28,169
it's all different because they're

1171
00:52:26,369 --> 00:52:30,059
looking for like this perfect structure

1172
00:52:28,169 --> 00:52:32,219
this crystalline structure in order to

1173
00:52:30,059 --> 00:52:35,069
put the photons in and set it all up and

1174
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:37,619
there's braiding so there's they're just

1175
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:39,719
studying the different topology parts of

1176
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:42,299
how you build a quantum computer is a

1177
00:52:39,719 --> 00:52:44,099
study in and of itself just on that you

1178
00:52:42,299 --> 00:52:46,769
could easily talk for two hours so

1179
00:52:44,099 --> 00:52:49,079
because of this nature of complexity

1180
00:52:46,769 --> 00:52:52,828
it's hard to say like okay this one

1181
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:54,929
person has all of those solutions so

1182
00:52:52,829 --> 00:52:57,630
it's engineering it's topology it's

1183
00:52:54,929 --> 00:53:00,209
actually being able to not get those

1184
00:52:57,630 --> 00:53:02,579
qubits in a state where they decohere

1185
00:53:00,209 --> 00:53:04,198
and evaporate what's one of the problems

1186
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:06,899
with quantum computers is now when

1187
00:53:04,199 --> 00:53:10,140
you're building physical qubits right

1188
00:53:06,899 --> 00:53:11,669
that doesn't scale well so the the thing

1189
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:14,189
is to try to build a universal quantum

1190
00:53:11,669 --> 00:53:16,348
computer with logical qubits that does

1191
00:53:14,189 --> 00:53:18,689
scale you know exponentially and that's

1192
00:53:16,349 --> 00:53:21,899
really hard to do so

1193
00:53:18,689 --> 00:53:23,939
IBM Google Microsoft they're running

1194
00:53:21,899 --> 00:53:26,519
their asses off and then the amount of

1195
00:53:23,939 --> 00:53:29,629
money that's being poured by China it's

1196
00:53:26,519 --> 00:53:33,209
not just a public effort it's also

1197
00:53:29,630 --> 00:53:36,059
Alibaba Jack Ma had pledged like 16

1198
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:37,769
billion to quantum research you know to

1199
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:40,549
develop labs all over the world I mean

1200
00:53:37,769 --> 00:53:43,618
that's a shitload of money the whole EU

1201
00:53:40,549 --> 00:53:45,899
flagship is one billion when I got onto

1202
00:53:43,619 --> 00:53:47,969
this EU team I thought oh my god that's

1203
00:53:45,899 --> 00:53:50,219
amazing there's only three flagships in

1204
00:53:47,969 --> 00:53:51,630
the EU the graphene project the human

1205
00:53:50,219 --> 00:53:53,699
brain project and the third one is

1206
00:53:51,630 --> 00:53:56,159
quantum so I thought ah this is so cool

1207
00:53:53,699 --> 00:54:00,439
I get to be on it yay but then I

1208
00:53:56,159 --> 00:54:05,399
realized it's not so cool it's 1 billion

1209
00:54:00,439 --> 00:54:07,199
spread out over ten years where only 500

1210
00:54:05,399 --> 00:54:09,209
million comes from the EU and the other

1211
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:13,349
500 million has to come from country

1212
00:54:09,209 --> 00:54:16,678
contributions so the EU together puts

1213
00:54:13,349 --> 00:54:22,139
500 million on the table and China is

1214
00:54:16,679 --> 00:54:24,119
putting billions and in one year so it's

1215
00:54:22,139 --> 00:54:27,059
not a fair game it's a completely

1216
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:30,289
asymmetric space so your guess is as

1217
00:54:27,059 --> 00:54:30,289
good as mine when we get there

1218
00:54:30,560 --> 00:55:08,640
yeah which technology yes so satellite

1219
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:10,170
to earth

1220
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:11,819
yeah but they also have satellite to

1221
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:14,880
satellite so the Chinese also did a

1222
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:18,030
fully encrypted satellite to satellite

1223
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:19,740
connection um also with the University

1224
00:55:18,030 --> 00:55:20,640
of Padua they did satellite to ground so

1225
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:23,160
they've also done the transatlantic

1226
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:25,740
connection for like they did a

1227
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:28,440
videoconference you know so this

1228
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:29,850
satellite is gonna be used way more for

1229
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,740
all of these things and it's only

1230
00:55:29,850 --> 00:55:33,509
getting more popular rather than less

1231
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:41,729
despite some of the implementation

1232
00:55:33,510 --> 00:55:43,110
obstacles well I don't think look I'm

1233
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:45,120
not saying throw the baby out with the

1234
00:55:43,110 --> 00:55:47,970
bathwater I'm saying do what we always

1235
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:49,049
did we always we know defense in depth

1236
00:55:47,970 --> 00:55:51,569
as cybersecurity

1237
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:52,140
that's all I'm suggesting get your stuff

1238
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:54,150
prepared

1239
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:56,339
think it through make sure you have

1240
00:55:54,150 --> 00:55:58,170
multiple alternatives don't put all of

1241
00:55:56,340 --> 00:56:00,720
your eggs in any one basket we

1242
00:55:58,170 --> 00:56:02,550
absolutely should not you know throw

1243
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,500
away everything we do now that is not

1244
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:06,360
what I'm saying I'm saying make sure you

1245
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:08,880
supplement it with post quantum

1246
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:10,260
algorithms look at you KD and figure out

1247
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:14,460
what your current cryptography is and

1248
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:16,560
how it's doing right okay hey one last

1249
00:56:14,460 --> 00:56:18,330
thing does anybody work I'm gonna say

1250
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:21,509
the magic words on like artificial

1251
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:24,000
intelligence at the moment so of course

1252
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:26,850
like the ultimate like vanilla ice cream

1253
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:29,250
sundae combination is a hardware

1254
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:32,450
topology using a quantum computer and

1255
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:35,030
trying to figure out how to map the

1256
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:37,759
exponential Hardware with some really

1257
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:40,130
smart software and machine learning to

1258
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:42,920
actually think about you know combining

1259
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:44,480
the two flavors into something that's

1260
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,890
actually worthwhile because instead of

1261
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:48,560
just looking at artificial intelligence

1262
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:50,328
work in software look at you know how do

1263
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:52,339
you actually map that onto a topology

1264
00:56:50,329 --> 00:56:53,510
that's quantum because it the software

1265
00:56:52,339 --> 00:56:56,480
part of it is just as much of a

1266
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:58,780
challenge as the hardware thank you so

1267
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:02,699
much guys thank you

1268
00:56:58,780 --> 00:57:02,699
[Applause]
