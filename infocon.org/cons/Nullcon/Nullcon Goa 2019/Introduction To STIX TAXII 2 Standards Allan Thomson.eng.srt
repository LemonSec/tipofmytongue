1
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:06,830
thank you

2
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:12,270
so I as I was introduced I'm Alan

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,309
Thompson one of the things that I also

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:17,880
do you know I'm filter a looking glass

5
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:20,340
but I also a co-chair steaks and taxi

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,669
version to interoperability subcommittee

7
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:25,620
and that committee I'll actually share

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:28,710
some details about what that objective

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:31,590
is as part of the presentation I also

10
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,980
have some live demos of some open-source

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:37,019
tools using sticks and taxi and

12
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:39,180
hopefully they actually work given the

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:44,070
internet and everybody else being on

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:45,780
here but let's dig in so before we talk

15
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,970
about sticks in taxi I wanted to ask a

16
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,600
question of how many people in this room

17
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:55,950
I've actually either created or read use

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,160
a sticks in their environment regardless

19
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:04,019
of version so I saw about three four

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,099
hands so or we'll get down thank you

21
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:08,609
yeah

22
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:11,759
so that is one of the things that I'm

23
00:01:08,609 --> 00:01:16,139
here to help change because one of the

24
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:20,369
things that this industry really needs

25
00:01:16,139 --> 00:01:24,719
is to work together and collaborate in a

26
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:27,179
way that starts to provide a way to

27
00:01:24,719 --> 00:01:27,839
fight back against adversaries it's way

28
00:01:27,179 --> 00:01:31,319
too easy

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:33,959
for actors who are targeting companies

30
00:01:31,319 --> 00:01:35,670
to attack you know the previous

31
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:39,090
gentleman just said you know it's easy

32
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,249
to be on the red team well the way that

33
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,990
we need to start changing the dynamics

34
00:01:41,249 --> 00:01:46,399
in our industry is start to actually

35
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:49,259
share information that's actionable and

36
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:52,649
I'm gonna go through some of how you

37
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:56,189
identify that how you use it so that you

38
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:58,139
can start taking about but stakes is the

39
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,119
the schema of the information that we're

40
00:01:58,139 --> 00:02:03,449
going to be talking about but it's not

41
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,759
just one aspect of that I want to

42
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,239
explain there's multiple aspects of

43
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,800
information that you need to exchange

44
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:14,960
one is the higher level intelligence

45
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:18,110
objects which a threat analysts are very

46
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,330
but in terms of you know who is building

47
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,490
a campaign against your organization or

48
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:24,650
against an industry those are typically

49
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:26,840
higher level intelligence subjects and

50
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:30,730
I'll actually show you some of that in a

51
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:33,770
minute there's also a lot of lower level

52
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:36,459
what I would call data facts they're not

53
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:39,860
really intelligence there are pieces of

54
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:43,880
data like an IP address like a domain

55
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:47,690
like a file a hash that when out of

56
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:49,790
context is sometimes not actionable and

57
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:51,920
the reason why that is is because until

58
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:54,769
you start to put it together with other

59
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,600
facts and other pieces of information it

60
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:58,430
may not be relevant to your environment

61
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,790
and may not even indicate a malicious

62
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:04,760
activity now stakes actually allows you

63
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:07,280
to build both the higher level object

64
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,010
model but also all of the facts that

65
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,350
support those higher level constructs

66
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:15,920
and those things typically are called in

67
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:18,470
stakes cyber observables now in another

68
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,649
key part of six is actually the pattern

69
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:23,570
grammar itself one of the things that

70
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:26,299
sticks is about is communicating

71
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:28,910
information to people who can share

72
00:03:26,299 --> 00:03:31,700
information and act on it the pattern

73
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:33,340
grammar allows you to program eyes that

74
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,768
and I'll show you some examples of that

75
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,989
we're also going to cover taxi and I'll

76
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:41,450
have a live demo of that that is the

77
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:43,459
application that allows you to exchange

78
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:46,730
sticks and then we'll talk about

79
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:49,489
interoperability let me give you a quick

80
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:51,048
brief overview of sticks and taxis so

81
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:53,989
sticks and taxi have been around for a

82
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:56,000
long time but they've really

83
00:03:53,989 --> 00:03:59,269
significantly changed over the many

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,299
years so they started out in 2012 it was

85
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:05,950
the original version that was developed

86
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:09,140
to create information sharing it was a

87
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:12,950
initial attempt at trying to do that

88
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:15,890
there was a lot of theory and and some

89
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:18,469
practice that went into it however over

90
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:20,539
the years it became obvious that many

91
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:22,510
companies who are building products for

92
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,740
intelligence-sharing

93
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:26,599
statistics version one had a lot of

94
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:30,590
problems in terms of scale and

95
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:33,080
usability so stakes - which is now part

96
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:36,140
of the wases community which is our

97
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:38,240
public standards organization is a

98
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,860
completely new version it's almost like

99
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,440
night and day different from sticks

100
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,580
version one and sticks to is the the

101
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,930
thing that I want to kind of talk about

102
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:51,320
and show you specifics so from at a high

103
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:52,970
level sticks to the the first thing that

104
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:57,080
most people talk about is that it's a

105
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:59,930
JSON not XML that on the surface might

106
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,240
seem like well duh it's like you know

107
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,860
why why would you ever choose XML no it

108
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,530
is for anything

109
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:09,050
however there's multiple reasons why

110
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:11,270
JSON was chosen not just in terms of

111
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:14,060
like programmability and ease of using

112
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:16,669
the data but also in terms of scale in

113
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,830
terms of flexibility that a JSON

114
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:21,290
provides now some XML provides some of

115
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:24,770
that but the key point is that is it's

116
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:26,360
much more effective and capable another

117
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:28,669
key thing that I want to point out is

118
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:32,030
that it wasn't just a data format from

119
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:33,710
XML to JSON it was also the data model

120
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:36,859
itself that was fundamentally broken

121
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:41,020
with sticks one so sticks one tended to

122
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:41,020
model things very hierarchical

123
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:47,060
very hierarchical and from a tradecraft

124
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:49,789
perspective from how analysts build

125
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:52,370
intelligence and build their knowledge

126
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:54,470
about what they're looking at it is that

127
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:57,050
model was not very conducive and

128
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:59,990
effective way to model things so what

129
00:05:57,050 --> 00:06:01,760
sticks do did was completely change how

130
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:04,580
you build intelligence to a much more

131
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:06,440
graph the base data model and I'm going

132
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,870
to ship you a lot of examples of that

133
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,140
but that fundamentally is much more

134
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:14,420
accurate to how threat analysts and

135
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:16,580
multiple teams work on intelligence they

136
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,440
they tend to build up individual pieces

137
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:21,229
of information and then they correlate

138
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:24,230
it together over time not everything is

139
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:27,680
constructed all at once and so having a

140
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:30,680
graph representing all the data and then

141
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,760
be able to leverage that using standard

142
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:37,880
ways is exactly what sticks to did now

143
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,289
taxi to is also you know the the

144
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,980
application that allows you to exchange

145
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,800
sticks

146
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:45,800
is a sister of their sticks the schema

147
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,960
taxi to is how we exchange it between

148
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:52,250
systems under standard way and taxi to

149
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:54,680
you also went from XML to JSON embraced

150
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:57,710
restful api switch is a fairly modern

151
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,780
well it's not not modern anymore it's

152
00:06:57,710 --> 00:07:02,659
been around for a long time but the it

153
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:04,640
taxi to is really much more moving into

154
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:06,500
this century of how you exchange data

155
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,570
and there's various aspects that I will

156
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:12,110
show I'll show in a minute so I want to

157
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:13,730
cover you know four areas one is I'm

158
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,430
going to talk about the sticks to data

159
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:18,290
model and how you model things that's

160
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:20,660
the second part of how you model real

161
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:23,480
world things like intelligence reports

162
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:26,090
like you know we were just talking

163
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:28,520
earlier about certain types of attack

164
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,349
behaviors you know the reason why people

165
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,140
try to use machine learning from the

166
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:34,880
previous presenter is because individual

167
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:36,080
indicators are not sufficient what

168
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,570
you're trying to do is understand

169
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:42,020
behaviors well sticks to data model

170
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:45,140
allows you to codify what behaviors are

171
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:47,510
and then I'll show you how important

172
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:49,219
that is from a tradecraft but also how

173
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:51,530
to do it in an interoperable way and

174
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,630
then the third part I'll actually show

175
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:56,989
you how is taxi to works and then

176
00:07:53,630 --> 00:08:00,710
finally talk about interoperability so

177
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:03,110
as I said there are four key aspects of

178
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:06,620
the data model in sticks - first is the

179
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:08,510
main objects which is if you are trying

180
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,580
to understand how adversaries are

181
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:13,370
potentially targeting you so for example

182
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:16,400
campaigns understanding which actors are

183
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:19,150
out there is a particular apt group is a

184
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,310
you know an individual is it

185
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:24,169
unidentified that you know very little

186
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:27,260
information about but you want to build

187
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:29,090
a model that you you know it's a entity

188
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:31,760
that's targeting you

189
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:33,709
there's relationships so they are they

190
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,960
kept the construct they'll be able to

191
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:38,260
connect individual pieces of information

192
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:40,970
together that builds a greater picture

193
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:45,160
cyber of examples I already said and

194
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:47,240
then part and grammar so sticks to

195
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,069
categorize these different types of

196
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,590
intelligence objects one of the first

197
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,630
things is how do you model adversary

198
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:55,459
behavior so as I've said campaign

199
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:58,600
so I have a green group that's a

200
00:08:55,459 --> 00:09:01,540
targeting with a specific objective of

201
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:03,470
potentially exploiting a particular

202
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,290
organization maybe a financial

203
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:09,050
institution how are they going about how

204
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:11,120
do you represent and sticks to what you

205
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:13,099
do is you start with an individual

206
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,050
object and then you could connect all

207
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,750
these the individual objects together to

208
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:19,550
represent the overall perspective of

209
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,170
intelligence and we're doing that

210
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:23,719
because what we want to be able to do is

211
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:26,479
eventually share it with other systems

212
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:29,779
that are going to ingest as a machine

213
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:31,610
not as a human being because today a lot

214
00:09:29,779 --> 00:09:34,519
of intelligence tradecraft tends to

215
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:37,009
involve human beings that have to read a

216
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:40,130
whole lot of things to then determine

217
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:42,019
action or some other event out of that

218
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:44,209
and what we're trying to do with sticks

219
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:47,180
is really move it more to a

220
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:49,279
machine-readable format that allows more

221
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:51,769
automation and therefore ultimately

222
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:54,230
would be more real-time be more

223
00:09:51,769 --> 00:09:55,850
actionable without human beings in the

224
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:57,110
loop we're not getting rid of human

225
00:09:55,850 --> 00:10:02,630
beings we're really making them more

226
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:05,329
efficient so another adversarial object

227
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:06,829
is intrusion set so if you're in you

228
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:08,149
know if you're a threat analyst this is

229
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:10,310
these are terms that you probably are

230
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:13,339
familiar with but an intrusion set at a

231
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:15,529
high level is really just aspects of

232
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:18,079
behavior that are in common across

233
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:22,240
multiple campaigns so an example might

234
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:28,040
be where an individual campaign is

235
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:30,709
targeting a third party who has the the

236
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:33,199
target example is always used as a pure

237
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:35,359
example but it it helps explain this so

238
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:39,170
I apologize for the example but how

239
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,579
argot happened was targets for you know

240
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:44,389
somebody who had access to the target

241
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:48,469
network had pure security they were

242
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:51,019
targeted and Exploited and then the

243
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:53,509
adversary then used that access to then

244
00:10:51,019 --> 00:10:57,139
get in to target so a campaign of

245
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:58,880
targeting that third party would be a

246
00:10:57,139 --> 00:11:01,100
single campaign but if you wanted to

247
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:03,260
represent the whole thing of what

248
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:06,230
they're our ultimate objective was which

249
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,069
was getting to target that could be

250
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:09,920
represented as

251
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:15,470
a set of campaigns over multiple weeks

252
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:18,920
or days you know getting to target okay

253
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:21,080
sticks to one of the key things that we

254
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:24,640
focused on is really how do you model

255
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:27,440
threat actors and it's not just about

256
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,720
you know their names which you may not

257
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,360
even know they may have personas

258
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,980
multiple personas but you know what what

259
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,810
are their capabilities what are their

260
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,940
objectives what are their motives and

261
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:39,829
all of this information is something

262
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:42,620
that needs to be codified so you can

263
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:44,810
share with other organizations so for

264
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:47,720
example if an actor is targeting a

265
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:49,930
financial institution that intelligence

266
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:52,400
if you're not a financial institution

267
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,900
allows you to immediately well I don't

268
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,480
care about this actor because they're

269
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,250
primarily motivated by trying to break

270
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,130
into financial institutions so that

271
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:03,530
information is very easily used to then

272
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:08,450
filter out some of the intelligence you

273
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:10,730
may be getting as an example so the

274
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:12,290
apologize this is a very detailed slide

275
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:16,550
but I wanted to highlight a couple of

276
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:19,069
things so the the the list of properties

277
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:21,199
that you see at the top are actually the

278
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:23,860
common attributes that all stakes

279
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:28,010
objects and add to sticks to that Oh

280
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:29,570
have I want to correlate two things that

281
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:31,490
are important from using six to

282
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:34,430
perspective the first is common varying

283
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:36,680
so how you version all objects and

284
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:38,209
sticks is really important because if

285
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,069
you're going to operationalize threat

286
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:42,470
intelligence what you really need to

287
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:45,320
care about is not just when something

288
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:49,160
was created but also if it's updated and

289
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,730
also when is something distributed or

290
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,060
published

291
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:55,430
downstream and so Styx has really

292
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:57,170
thought about not just what data do I

293
00:12:55,430 --> 00:13:00,109
need to represent from a you know

294
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:02,599
capturing intelligence data but how do I

295
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:04,790
then operationalize it in an environment

296
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:07,610
and make sure that those data properties

297
00:13:04,790 --> 00:13:09,829
can be used for systems that you're

298
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:12,440
connecting together and so there's a lot

299
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:14,660
of rules that are actually defined in

300
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,220
six to about you know who's like to

301
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,170
create something who's like to modify

302
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:20,600
something what are the rules for

303
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:22,069
when you must modify something versus

304
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,630
when you do it you know if you decide to

305
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:26,839
delete something what are the rules and

306
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:28,820
sticks actually you know has focused on

307
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:30,680
a lot of those key operational aspects

308
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:32,899
the other thing I want to highlight in

309
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:36,589
this is this simple little property

310
00:13:32,899 --> 00:13:38,149
created by so again operationally this

311
00:13:36,589 --> 00:13:39,680
might seem like you know it's just a

312
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:41,899
data property you know fill it in or I

313
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,359
don't well one of the key things is an

314
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:46,160
you know practitioner and creating

315
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,839
intelligence or consuming intelligence

316
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,540
is really where does intelligence come

317
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,850
from because a lot of information that

318
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,800
you're going to act upon typically what

319
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:58,250
you're caring about is the confidence of

320
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,229
that data and you know how how reliable

321
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:02,839
is the source of that information and so

322
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:05,480
Styx has I too particularly has focused

323
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:08,089
on representing things that are very

324
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:09,800
common in the trade where you want to

325
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:11,810
represent not just the intelligence but

326
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,540
who is actually creating this

327
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:16,849
intelligence because if you get a piece

328
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,599
of intelligence that has no source data

329
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:21,709
then how reliable is it you know I

330
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,449
attended the keynote this morning where

331
00:14:21,709 --> 00:14:26,060
they were talking about you know how

332
00:14:23,449 --> 00:14:28,459
people try to influence elections by you

333
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:30,260
know you know information there well if

334
00:14:28,459 --> 00:14:34,099
you don't know where information is

335
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:35,959
coming from how reliable is it now with

336
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,790
stakes - one of the key things they

337
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:40,069
focus on is well we want to bill

338
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:42,500
identify sources because then we can

339
00:14:40,070 --> 00:14:45,860
start to attribute trust and we can also

340
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:47,269
start to you know know that oh I got

341
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,730
this piece of intelligence that sticks

342
00:14:47,269 --> 00:14:52,040
to it came from you know bla vendor or

343
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:53,660
bla organization and it was you know

344
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:55,969
always accurate it was always

345
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,740
fashionable and I never had any false

346
00:14:55,970 --> 00:15:00,050
positives from that organization so

347
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:03,680
whereas if I get it from say an open

348
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:06,319
source organization where they produce a

349
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:08,630
lot of data but it may be noisy it has

350
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:10,670
some false positives then how you treat

351
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:12,800
the data from now organization versus a

352
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:15,889
more reliable organization who's always

353
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,899
fairly accurate a you know changes how

354
00:15:15,889 --> 00:15:19,310
you respond to intelligence and these

355
00:15:17,899 --> 00:15:21,260
are some of the things that sticks to of

356
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:23,239
really focused on so it's much more than

357
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:25,730
just about a data model and a database

358
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:28,110
schema it's more how you use the data

359
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:30,750
and operationalize it

360
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:31,800
so another key part that the previous

361
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:33,300
gentleman where he was talking about

362
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,920
artificial intelligence and machine

363
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,349
learning and I broke his rule where you

364
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:40,560
know like disable things but okay the

365
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:43,050
key thing is that you know how you model

366
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,640
behaviors is a fundamental aspect of

367
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:47,459
intelligence because technical

368
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,810
indicators the cyber observables without

369
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,780
context and without really understanding

370
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:52,979
how they connect is a fundamentally

371
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:56,459
important thing that you need to

372
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:59,970
understand and so you know six-two has

373
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:01,830
multiple aspects of TTP's this one is an

374
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:03,840
attack pattern so typically you know

375
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:06,660
spearfishing which is a very common way

376
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:10,200
of trying to exploit you know somebody

377
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:13,199
may be targeted maybe may not be so you

378
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:15,960
want to build a represent a this

379
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:17,940
campaign or this intrusion set you know

380
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:19,740
all starts with a spear phishing email

381
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,810
and here's the details of that you know

382
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:25,290
that typically of the the email for

383
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:27,949
example tools are also important so a

384
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:30,449
lot of legitimate tools exist for

385
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:34,140
important reasons but they're also used

386
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:36,810
by actors to potentially do scanning so

387
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:39,930
nmap is a common one where you know if

388
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:41,130
you see an occurring you know scanning

389
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:43,620
your environment and you're not

390
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:47,130
expecting it that could be indicative of

391
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:48,630
malicious or intent you know there's

392
00:16:47,130 --> 00:16:50,640
obviously a lot more that has to go into

393
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:53,490
that decision but the key point here is

394
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:55,560
you want to build a model you know they

395
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:57,840
send spear phishing or they then you

396
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,599
know do they use this tool in this way

397
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:02,910
so the ability to model those types of

398
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:05,880
things and represent TTP's is really

399
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:08,069
important malware I think probably

400
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,089
everybody would guess that that's a

401
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:12,750
really important thing

402
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:16,619
but sticks to has substantially you know

403
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:18,720
gone into the details of that so drill I

404
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:21,599
represent individual malware instances

405
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:23,400
malware families and there's a new

406
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,250
object in sticks 2.1 which is just

407
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,900
coming out in a month or so which is

408
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:31,650
malware analysis so we're able to

409
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:34,800
represent sandbox out from running it

410
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:37,410
saying virus total with or you know your

411
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,940
favorite vendor who supports sandbox and

412
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:41,340
capabilities there's a lot of different

413
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:42,960
dynamic and static analysis that i've

414
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,909
are available in the market some are

415
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,380
open-source some are commercial and what

416
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:49,320
we wanted to be able to do in sticks -

417
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,540
one is really represent all of that

418
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,700
information in a standard format so that

419
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:55,530
it can be shared so now vendors can

420
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:58,110
actually start to share their static

421
00:17:55,530 --> 00:18:03,660
analysis of malware as part of this new

422
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:06,840
in the object malware so two tips one of

423
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:09,060
the things that malware has is this idea

424
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,500
of kill chain which was originally you

425
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,000
know I think it's a registered trademark

426
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,490
of Lockheed Martin but there's actually

427
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,880
multiple different types of you know

428
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:21,120
that concept of phasing of attacks and

429
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,460
one of the things that sticks to wanted

430
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:26,760
to represent was how do we model attack

431
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:29,070
patterns to that set of phases so is is

432
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:31,650
this tool or this attack pattern

433
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:34,200
typically in this phrase of an attack

434
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:36,630
and so we want to build a represent that

435
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,940
and that's why they're the other thing

436
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:41,220
that's really important which the

437
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,650
intelligence trade typically shares

438
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:46,890
information not as a public broadcast is

439
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:49,500
typically classified which if you come

440
00:18:46,890 --> 00:18:50,970
from a more traditional defense a

441
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:53,970
background that has a very specific

442
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:58,020
meaning and that's what you know sticks

443
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:59,810
to has embraced because intelligence you

444
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,160
want to be able to say okay this is a

445
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:04,740
t.o.p read if if you're familiar with

446
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,860
TLP whereas if this piece of

447
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:10,980
intelligence is more broadly disseminate

448
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:14,040
TLP why or green or something so sticks

449
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:16,260
to has really embraced some fundamental

450
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:18,210
things that were you know either not

451
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:23,220
recognized at all or we're really hard

452
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:24,450
to do previously so another key part you

453
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,240
know what what do I adversities

454
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:28,830
typically do they typically exploit

455
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,330
things and so representing

456
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:32,280
vulnerabilities and understanding how

457
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:35,100
that represents relates to the

458
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:38,389
intelligence is a key part course of

459
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:41,010
action so sticks to is not just about

460
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:43,620
sharing what information you know about

461
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:46,379
how you're attacked but also providing

462
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:49,199
ability to communicate how to respond to

463
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:51,990
the attack and so of course of action is

464
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:54,180
an object that allows you to represent

465
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:57,750
both machine as well as human

466
00:19:54,180 --> 00:20:00,720
contact and in 2.1 it's gone through a

467
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:03,360
substantial revision that allows you to

468
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,100
start to connect to other standards that

469
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:07,530
are out there for course of action such

470
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,870
as open situ and that could cause so if

471
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:12,090
you're interested in any of those I

472
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:13,850
encourage you to look at them identity

473
00:20:12,090 --> 00:20:17,370
is really you know how you represent

474
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:19,050
individuals groups organizations report

475
00:20:17,370 --> 00:20:20,969
I'm going to go through a specific

476
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:23,639
example in a second where I'm going to

477
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:26,040
talk about how you map a typically an

478
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:28,790
intelligence report and map it into a

479
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:31,860
machine readable version of it in 62 and

480
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:34,530
but there is a this construction stakes

481
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:36,510
to to represent those things a couple of

482
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:40,410
tips of course of action as I mentioned

483
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:44,250
is new and 2.1 connect to cv you know

484
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:46,320
database so sticks to is not assuming

485
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:48,240
that all information is contained within

486
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,040
the single place of the single database

487
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,500
there's a lot of very rich information

488
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:56,040
that's either in ticket systems you know

489
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,870
lookup databases like the MVD DB so the

490
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,370
key point is the sticks to allows you to

491
00:20:57,870 --> 00:21:01,050
represent those things so it doesn't

492
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:03,149
require you to pull all this information

493
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:06,510
in a single place you can actually

494
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:08,760
connect and and relate your intelligence

495
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:11,600
to these other sources using some of

496
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:14,790
these constructs that are in sticks to

497
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:17,490
indicators are typically much more lower

498
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:19,950
level but they tend to represent things

499
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,630
that are of interest I won't call

500
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:24,300
malicious because there's many things

501
00:21:21,630 --> 00:21:26,220
that are of interest that may not be

502
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:29,520
malicious and so what you want to build

503
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:32,220
to do is represent what behaviors or

504
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,790
data represents something of interest

505
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:38,490
and so sticks to has introduced a

506
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:42,139
pattern grammar that is very very

507
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:45,540
similar to like reg X it is reg X but

508
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:48,420
allows you to express you know options

509
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:50,940
where you can combine things like if you

510
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:54,120
see this email address with this domain

511
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:56,820
and this file characteristic then this

512
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:59,030
is an indicator that I want to fire in

513
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:02,639
my environment for whatever reason

514
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:04,920
observe data represents where you're

515
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,360
actually starting to see things changing

516
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,250
so the previous presentation talked

517
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:11,250
about you know I

518
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:13,830
solution where would I understand

519
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:16,529
endpoints or the data on endpoints so

520
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:20,158
things like registry modifications you

521
00:22:16,529 --> 00:22:23,460
know file socket behaviors and observed

522
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:25,379
data in 262 is a way to represent all of

523
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:28,889
those individual pieces of data in a

524
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:31,709
collection now in Stix 2.1 this is

525
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:35,008
actually substantially changing to allow

526
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:36,570
you much more flexibility and you know

527
00:22:35,009 --> 00:22:39,860
it's a fairly advanced topic but the

528
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:42,090
reason why is enhancing it is because

529
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:44,340
organizations wanted to be able to

530
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:46,350
represent those individual facts

531
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:50,009
directly related to other data and

532
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:52,678
sticks to didn't allow them sighting is

533
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:55,470
a sighting of you saw something in the

534
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:57,840
environment and you can you can say as

535
00:22:55,470 --> 00:22:59,759
little or as much as you want about that

536
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,399
sighting and that typically is very

537
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:04,529
useful for if you've got a community of

538
00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:08,129
intelligence organizations are seeing

539
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:10,799
all of this intelligence being posted

540
00:23:08,129 --> 00:23:13,529
and they say hey I saw that indicator or

541
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,360
I saw this campaign and you can say

542
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:17,039
literally that you can just put your

543
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:19,019
hand up and say yep that's all I saw and

544
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,580
you don't provide any details but sticks

545
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:23,429
to allows you to actually provide a lot

546
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:25,678
more details using the observed data and

547
00:23:23,429 --> 00:23:28,620
the sighting construct where you can say

548
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:33,419
I saw that thing and here's the specific

549
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:35,340
details of what I saw steak's 2.1 has a

550
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:37,200
whole lotta enhancements now given most

551
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:38,668
people in the room didn't you know there

552
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,769
was about three people I think it said

553
00:23:38,669 --> 00:23:42,929
that you know the board was sticks but

554
00:23:40,769 --> 00:23:44,759
there's a lot of continuing development

555
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:46,080
to improve things I think I'll call out

556
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:48,990
one specifically which is around

557
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,779
internationalization so we live in a

558
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:53,970
world that has many different languages

559
00:23:50,779 --> 00:23:55,649
obviously and we want to build represent

560
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:57,840
the intelligence not in a single

561
00:23:55,649 --> 00:24:00,889
language there's important reasons why

562
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:03,178
that is not just for locality but also

563
00:24:00,889 --> 00:24:05,428
things that are expressed in one

564
00:24:03,179 --> 00:24:06,990
language in a certain way could mean

565
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:09,539
something and if you did a Google

566
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:11,309
Translate to your comm you your language

567
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:13,950
it might not translate the meaning or

568
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:16,200
the the intent of what that thing said

569
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:19,259
and so intelligence is about

570
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:21,690
interpretation and understanding and so

571
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:24,750
it's really important that you wrappers

572
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:27,420
the original data as well as potentially

573
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:30,380
having translated versions as well and

574
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:32,580
so sticks 2.1 introduces that capability

575
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:33,330
what else don't want to see I think

576
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:36,060
we'll keep going

577
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:39,600
so one other thing I mentioned was you

578
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:42,600
know the the confidence of the data and

579
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:45,360
sticks to recognize that there are many

580
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:47,459
different forms of how you represent the

581
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,050
conference of that data so some people

582
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,120
might be familiar with the Admiralty

583
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:55,350
scale which is you know one way of doing

584
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:57,870
a web 0 at an high low medium and sticks

585
00:24:55,350 --> 00:25:00,179
to you know recognize that many vendors

586
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:02,310
have legitimate reasons why they want to

587
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:04,590
use different scales however if you're

588
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:06,600
going to share intelligence and have a

589
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:08,730
common way to represent are to

590
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,740
understand you know these different

591
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:12,660
schemes then sticks to actually came up

592
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:16,560
with a model that allows you to

593
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:18,810
normalize it into a common scheme across

594
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:21,179
those different scales so if you're used

595
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:23,760
to using teal you know sorry I'd mercy

596
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:25,470
scale you can continue to do that but

597
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:28,650
you can then publish your data in sticks

598
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:30,900
too and somebody who uses you know 0 100

599
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:35,120
there's a standard mapping of how you

600
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:38,060
represent arbitrary in to 0 and 100 so

601
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:41,370
want to move into like giving you some

602
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:43,679
high-level information about the data

603
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:45,510
model I want to start talking about how

604
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:48,320
you actually start using it in practice

605
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:51,930
with some reports so I have two examples

606
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,790
one is I an intelligence report that I'm

607
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:55,440
going to go through and show you how to

608
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:57,450
take you know a higher level

609
00:25:55,440 --> 00:26:00,180
intelligence report and map it to 6 -

610
00:25:57,450 --> 00:26:04,140
and then I have some modeling around apt

611
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:06,270
actors but you know at a concept level

612
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,980
what people are trying to do when the

613
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:10,050
model things is they take all those

614
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:12,030
individual objects that I just described

615
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:14,730
but then you start to connect in

616
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:20,330
meaningful ways that you'll represent a

617
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:22,800
construct that you want to act on so if

618
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:25,679
you would like to follow along this

619
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,210
report it's free to download I'm going

620
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,820
to go through the example and I'll just

621
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:33,840
say switch to the screenshot for a

622
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:35,399
second so this is a report it's based on

623
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:39,149
a line rat

624
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:41,279
which is a remote access tool it is this

625
00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:44,928
report is a high-level report you can

626
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:48,089
see it's t.o.p green with a1 confidence

627
00:26:44,929 --> 00:26:50,969
it has an a high-level executive summary

628
00:26:48,089 --> 00:26:53,580
talks about you know when the

629
00:26:50,969 --> 00:26:56,190
information was initially observed any

630
00:26:53,580 --> 00:27:00,210
attribution to the actor in this case

631
00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:02,009
that name has some key points then goes

632
00:27:00,210 --> 00:27:04,409
through you know some more detail about

633
00:27:02,009 --> 00:27:07,469
blame right it then goes into some

634
00:27:04,409 --> 00:27:08,759
screenshots taking from github then

635
00:27:07,469 --> 00:27:11,869
talks about some of the information

636
00:27:08,759 --> 00:27:15,149
about malware how it does this behavior

637
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:19,769
etc etc then has some screenshots of the

638
00:27:15,149 --> 00:27:23,309
ransomware feature that includes and and

639
00:27:19,769 --> 00:27:25,859
so on so that's a high-level PDF report

640
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:28,200
that is very common in the industry this

641
00:27:25,859 --> 00:27:30,269
is obviously you know from looking class

642
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,489
but there are many vendors who do this

643
00:27:30,269 --> 00:27:35,369
type of thing and the key point here is

644
00:27:32,489 --> 00:27:37,259
not really you know say okay that's

645
00:27:35,369 --> 00:27:39,839
that's it it's like well how do I

646
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:42,690
measure operationalize this how do I

647
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:45,599
turn this into something that I can act

648
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:49,499
on because if I get a PDF report I can

649
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:51,928
scrape the PDF forwards and maybe I can

650
00:27:49,499 --> 00:27:54,629
pull out indicators using that but

651
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:56,639
that's and people do that by the way no

652
00:27:54,629 --> 00:27:58,228
that's a very common thing but the key

653
00:27:56,639 --> 00:28:00,629
point is that if you really want to

654
00:27:58,229 --> 00:28:02,219
operationalize structured intelligence

655
00:28:00,629 --> 00:28:04,529
you need to figure out okay how am I

656
00:28:02,219 --> 00:28:07,289
going to construct a data model that

657
00:28:04,529 --> 00:28:08,700
represents this whole report and all of

658
00:28:07,289 --> 00:28:10,919
the information is in the report in

659
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:14,609
sticks to so that I can then communicate

660
00:28:10,919 --> 00:28:16,739
it in a machine readable format so if I

661
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:18,389
go back to the PowerPoint you know and

662
00:28:16,739 --> 00:28:19,379
as I say this report is downloadable so

663
00:28:18,389 --> 00:28:21,779
you can follow along if you're

664
00:28:19,379 --> 00:28:25,439
interested I want to show you an open

665
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:28,190
source tool that where what I did was to

666
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,570
to kind of help talk through the report

667
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:32,969
there's this open source field called

668
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:36,539
the sticks visualizer it was initially

669
00:28:32,969 --> 00:28:39,299
developed by some folks at mitre who are

670
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:41,820
funded by the DHS to help fund you know

671
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:47,158
some of the development and I want to

672
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:48,570
show you you know what I did so I will

673
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:56,130
switch to

674
00:28:48,570 --> 00:29:02,970
this is the the JSON it's not switching

675
00:28:56,130 --> 00:29:07,559
I don't know why it's not switching hmm

676
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:14,070
maybe I need to gonna go as a slide more

677
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:17,509
to see if it okay so this is the raw

678
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:19,740
JSON that I constructed as you can see

679
00:29:17,509 --> 00:29:21,659
you know there's a lot of details in

680
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,210
there there's all at all J pointers and

681
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:25,980
you know stuff that a human being can

682
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:28,080
read but you really don't want to be

683
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:29,820
constructing this yourself because you

684
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,668
know this took me quite a while to do

685
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:35,070
this you know and obviously you know

686
00:29:32,669 --> 00:29:37,500
that's just one report if I have 10,000

687
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:40,168
reports a day and are a million reports

688
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:42,269
the day then you know human beings

689
00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:44,879
quickly are going to be exhausted so

690
00:29:42,269 --> 00:29:47,519
this is the raw data if I go to my

691
00:29:44,879 --> 00:29:51,870
browser this is the the stinks

692
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:54,179
visualizer URL and what you can do is it

693
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:57,000
has different ways to load it you can

694
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:59,759
choose files what I've done is I've

695
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,820
pasted the content in here and you hit

696
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:04,620
parse and I wasn't sure if the internet

697
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:07,139
was going to be flaky or not so I wanted

698
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:11,100
to kind of preload it so I have this tab

699
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:13,168
set up where what I did was I parse the

700
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:19,709
JSON that I just showed you and if I can

701
00:30:13,169 --> 00:30:23,100
zoom out just enough you can see the the

702
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:25,259
sticks data model representing aspects

703
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:27,719
of the report so you can see for example

704
00:30:25,259 --> 00:30:32,100
the legend on the right hand side and

705
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:35,850
then you have the the main actor it has

706
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:41,009
a location it has a couple of you know

707
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:43,830
attack patterns for example sorry keep a

708
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:45,990
Taipan is over here we have a marking

709
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:47,850
definition we have a couple of other

710
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:49,830
actors who've actually comment either

711
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:51,719
provide you feedback and what you're

712
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:54,899
starting to see here is that graph data

713
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:56,549
model in reality within the sticks to

714
00:30:54,899 --> 00:30:58,590
data model so I've created these

715
00:30:56,549 --> 00:31:00,980
individual constructs and then I've

716
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:04,168
start to connect them in a way that

717
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:06,510
what the actual report is representing

718
00:31:04,169 --> 00:31:09,630
but it's in a machine-readable format

719
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:12,960
now if I click on you know one of these

720
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:15,900
for example down here the tool the open

721
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:17,700
source tool actually shows you the node

722
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:21,480
you know all the data like created

723
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:23,490
modified all of the objects are parked

724
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:24,990
on the repor object so it's actually

725
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:26,730
showing me the connection to all of

726
00:31:24,990 --> 00:31:29,340
those objects that are part of their

727
00:31:26,730 --> 00:31:31,620
poor and the key point here is that it's

728
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:34,500
an easy way to quickly represent and

729
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:37,049
view what is ultimately you know

730
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:40,140
typically a json report is not easy to

731
00:31:37,049 --> 00:31:42,658
read as a human being you know and and

732
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:45,570
as analysts this is what you really need

733
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:47,490
to understand you need to be focused on

734
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:49,408
using the data rather than having to

735
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:50,760
worry about data formats or trying to

736
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:52,289
make sure that you've got object

737
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:54,510
pointers connecting to object pointers

738
00:31:52,289 --> 00:31:56,039
so this is starting to kind of up level

739
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:59,520
the use of the intelligence in a way

740
00:31:56,039 --> 00:32:03,510
that is more useful so if I go back to

741
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:07,770
my slides apologize didn't realize that

742
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:11,700
slide mode didn't so the first thing of

743
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:13,770
the report I want to call I is intro

744
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:17,460
stuff that was an initial page and it

745
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:19,139
was the identity of who's publishing

746
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:21,059
this information so in this case looking

747
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:22,919
glass but it could be any anybody could

748
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:24,840
be a government entity it could be an

749
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:27,450
open-source organization could be a

750
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:30,270
financial FSI site for example you know

751
00:32:27,450 --> 00:32:32,250
what's the report the information and

752
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:34,980
these are on the right-hand side here

753
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:38,070
you see specific sticks to data model

754
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:40,500
objects of what represents the coming

755
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:42,809
out of the high-level report so the

756
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:45,860
first thing is t.o.p green that gets

757
00:32:42,809 --> 00:32:48,570
mapped to a data marking in sticks to

758
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:51,719
the next part is the confidence level

759
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:53,549
which gets mapped to in sticks to

760
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,620
confidence is actually a property it's

761
00:32:53,549 --> 00:32:57,600
not an object but the key point is the

762
00:32:55,620 --> 00:33:01,709
same that it maps to something in sticks

763
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:04,529
to intro paragraph it's an executive

764
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:06,600
summary but really is identifying one

765
00:33:04,529 --> 00:33:09,419
primary thing which is the thread actor

766
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:11,709
in this case I don't know you say that

767
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:13,810
in a an X

768
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:17,020
Bannen starts to talk about things like

769
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:18,879
you know remote access ransomware key

770
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:21,070
logging these are all attack patterns

771
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,980
that need to be represented in the data

772
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:25,870
and so these high-level sentences if

773
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:28,990
you're an analyst you would have to read

774
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:31,239
it and then figure out how to okay what

775
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:33,040
does this mean to me in my environment

776
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:34,750
well sticks to if this was all but

777
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,700
represented in snakes - and you saw in

778
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:39,490
the sticks visualizer it's already

779
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:41,860
easily more more machine readable and

780
00:33:39,490 --> 00:33:46,780
therefore processing much more quickly

781
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:49,840
and effectively malware yo-you malware

782
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:53,820
objects indicators so in this case lime

783
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:56,470
right communicates with pastebin and

784
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:58,450
that's an indicator there's also an

785
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:02,530
indicator for you know the some code

786
00:33:58,450 --> 00:34:04,210
that's been shared about plugin that is

787
00:34:02,530 --> 00:34:07,720
also an indicator that you can use

788
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:09,730
potentially there's more details on some

789
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:11,199
of the attack patterns so for example

790
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:12,699
like the you know the encrypted

791
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:15,850
communications between the server and

792
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:17,770
the client you know what does it do in

793
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:22,509
terms of like spreading so in fact all

794
00:34:17,770 --> 00:34:25,840
files via USB indicator so payload is

795
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:27,370
typically 25k so that can be used as an

796
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:30,370
indicator so these things that are

797
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:32,859
expressed in human language doesn't have

798
00:34:30,370 --> 00:34:35,949
to be English it could be Hindi or Hindu

799
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:39,690
or you know minder in the the key point

800
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:42,759
is that the more that you map it to a

801
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:46,240
construct that a machine understands the

802
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:48,640
last you're dependent on human beings to

803
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:50,560
the first are because we are all

804
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:52,179
fallible and we all interpret things

805
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:55,630
differently and the more that you are

806
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:58,240
able to map it to a common construct

807
00:34:55,630 --> 00:35:01,530
that can then a machine act on that's

808
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:04,810
one of the key objectives or sticks to

809
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:06,640
so you know there's with to two other

810
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:08,680
thread actors who have commented on the

811
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,170
usefulness of lime wrap and so that

812
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:14,350
those are obviously information that you

813
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:16,060
want to retain why because maybe they

814
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:18,880
are actually using a variant of lime

815
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:20,799
rely now this individual reports makes

816
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,240
no mention of what those two thread

817
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:24,670
actors are doing or what their

818
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,729
objectives are however

819
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:29,650
you mail a LAN later six months later 12

820
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:31,359
months later that those actors are

821
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:33,190
actually targeting a different

822
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:35,710
organization or a different you know

823
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:37,900
using language or a variant of it with

824
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:40,269
some other capabilities and they've

825
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:44,140
combined it into a new way and they are

826
00:35:40,269 --> 00:35:45,819
talking your organization so this

827
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:48,519
individual report might just have a name

828
00:35:45,819 --> 00:35:50,170
and you want to construct that but maybe

829
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:52,569
six months later you get additional data

830
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:54,369
that that graph data model it sticks to

831
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:56,950
allows you to model then allows you to

832
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:59,079
attach that additional intelligence to

833
00:35:56,950 --> 00:36:01,210
that original report data and builds up

834
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:03,130
a much greater picture of the world that

835
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:06,250
you're trying to understand and act upon

836
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:08,109
you know location is another key part

837
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:11,519
you know sometimes it doesn't really

838
00:36:08,109 --> 00:36:13,269
matter because an adversary the

839
00:36:11,519 --> 00:36:14,979
especially skilled ones will

840
00:36:13,269 --> 00:36:17,049
deliberately try to obfuscate where

841
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:18,609
they're really coming from because they

842
00:36:17,049 --> 00:36:21,970
may think that you know that somehow

843
00:36:18,609 --> 00:36:26,170
matters but the key point is that you

844
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:28,959
know you'll an attack me be started from

845
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:31,569
a country X but the adversary was

846
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:33,430
actually in country Y and they were

847
00:36:31,569 --> 00:36:35,259
doing that to try and point the finger

848
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:36,700
somewhere else and obfuscated it you

849
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:38,380
know it could also be the look they're

850
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:40,450
attacking you from a tour X and no it

851
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:42,789
you know and so you know tour by

852
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:44,078
deliberately tries to office K even

853
00:36:42,789 --> 00:36:46,329
although it's you know somewhat

854
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:48,519
trackable just an extent so the key

855
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:51,400
point here is that you want to represent

856
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:53,680
you know these uncertain facts so it's

857
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:56,430
not just data facts about a specific IP

858
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:59,169
a domain it's about behaviors and

859
00:36:56,430 --> 00:37:00,910
uncertainty because that is what

860
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:03,670
intelligence analysts are really trying

861
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:04,839
to represent is that that nothing is

862
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:06,730
black and white you know I'm not a

863
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:08,410
threat analyst but I work in this field

864
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:10,990
and so trying to have a conversation

865
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:14,348
with a threat analyst about certainty is

866
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:16,990
very frustrating because they feel that

867
00:37:14,349 --> 00:37:19,569
they're not able to say black and white

868
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:22,750
it's this it's there's always degrees of

869
00:37:19,569 --> 00:37:24,880
certainty or uncertainty and that's what

870
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:27,460
sticks to is representing is that

871
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,769
uncertainty and that's important if

872
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:32,039
you're considering having a machine act

873
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:35,470
on that information again it's all about

874
00:37:32,039 --> 00:37:37,240
operationalizing the intelligence so the

875
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:38,040
next example I wanted to show you is

876
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:42,229
around

877
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:46,259
three apt actors a twenty eight one and

878
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:48,150
twenty nine the reason why I put the you

879
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:50,430
know this information which ultimately

880
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:53,310
came from my door attack so this is not

881
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:54,839
looking us derived information this is

882
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:56,220
information that was I think the

883
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:59,580
previous gentleman talked about mitre

884
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:02,129
attack framework I to I'm very you know

885
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:04,290
bullish about people learning that

886
00:38:02,130 --> 00:38:06,780
because it's a really important under

887
00:38:04,290 --> 00:38:08,430
you know to understand behaviors and the

888
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:12,780
relationships between behaviors is

889
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:14,430
really important and this information

890
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:17,250
comes from this so two of the actors

891
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:20,879
have been attributed based in

892
00:38:17,250 --> 00:38:23,250
intelligence to you know Russia and an

893
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,310
apt one has been you know a different

894
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:27,900
organization or a different country and

895
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:31,140
what I want to point out in what I'm

896
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:33,900
gonna do next is how you start to see

897
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,710
common behaviors regardless of where

898
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:38,100
they're coming from

899
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:42,870
now why does that matter well if you're

900
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:44,580
a defender you're the blue team what

901
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:46,710
you're trying to do is you know if

902
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:48,390
you're an enterprise organization you're

903
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:51,150
not a government if you're an enterprise

904
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:53,819
you don't you're not law enforcement so

905
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:54,990
you're not going to go and like go after

906
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:56,490
somebody what you're going to do is

907
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:58,229
you're just trying to understand what

908
00:38:56,490 --> 00:39:00,709
are they doing how are they doing it and

909
00:38:58,230 --> 00:39:04,620
so I can figure out how to stop them

910
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:07,320
right and you don't really care about

911
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:09,660
this you know the threat actor from that

912
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:11,640
perspective now you may have

913
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:13,230
attributable information that you can

914
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,690
then pass on to a law enforcement

915
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:16,980
organization if it is criminal but the

916
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:19,340
key point is that what you're really

917
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:22,710
trying to do is understand behaviors and

918
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:24,240
one of the things that this information

919
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:25,310
which as I say it came from you know

920
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,509
mitre

921
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:30,029
what you can start to see when you start

922
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:33,720
to represent all of these objects and

923
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:36,030
connect the dots you start to see common

924
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:39,149
behaviors and common attack you know

925
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:41,910
patterns now once you start seeing these

926
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:43,710
things you know the more public this

927
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:45,299
information becomes the more likely if

928
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:46,980
the especially if they're sophisticated

929
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:50,049
actors they're likely they're going to

930
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:52,209
change you know the you know if you say

931
00:39:50,049 --> 00:39:54,038
act or X is you know doing this

932
00:39:52,209 --> 00:39:55,930
particular type of thing in the network

933
00:39:54,039 --> 00:39:58,269
they send this specific spear phishing

934
00:39:55,930 --> 00:40:00,279
email with this content and that's

935
00:39:58,269 --> 00:40:02,169
published on the Internet then guess

936
00:40:00,279 --> 00:40:03,699
what they're not gonna do that much

937
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:06,640
longer if they're smart because then

938
00:40:03,699 --> 00:40:08,619
it's easy for as a defender to stop that

939
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,489
if they keep doing that you say yeah I

940
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:12,849
saw that

941
00:40:09,489 --> 00:40:15,549
to stop them right so adversaries are

942
00:40:12,849 --> 00:40:17,410
not that dumb it's also much easier for

943
00:40:15,549 --> 00:40:20,049
them to pivot than it actually is for a

944
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:22,269
defender to pivot and so the key point

945
00:40:20,049 --> 00:40:25,089
here is you start to build up a picture

946
00:40:22,269 --> 00:40:26,618
of the different attack patterns the

947
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:30,069
different TTP's and that's really

948
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:32,430
important so let me switch to the tool I

949
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:37,089
want to show you in the browser and

950
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:46,598
hopefully it switches I didn't switch so

951
00:40:37,089 --> 00:40:51,369
I'm gonna go a slide mode again and then

952
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:54,249
go to the browser so I have a tool you

953
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:57,519
know but this could be any tip you know

954
00:40:54,249 --> 00:40:59,288
ultimately this is a product that you

955
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:01,508
know we've built but the key point here

956
00:40:59,289 --> 00:41:04,329
is that we have a third act information

957
00:41:01,509 --> 00:41:06,429
that came from my door attack this case

958
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:09,279
this AP 28 you see all the information

959
00:41:06,429 --> 00:41:11,109
that came from my row type framework so

960
00:41:09,279 --> 00:41:13,209
they have a whole lot of citations and

961
00:41:11,109 --> 00:41:14,979
information some attributed to Christ

962
00:41:13,209 --> 00:41:18,308
rate for example some attributed to fire

963
00:41:14,979 --> 00:41:22,118
I and this is the the threat actor so if

964
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:24,699
I go to the model and understand the

965
00:41:22,119 --> 00:41:28,449
relationship you can start to see I have

966
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:31,269
a PT 28 then have some apt information

967
00:41:28,449 --> 00:41:36,819
about different types of behaviors so

968
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:38,439
they you know evade defense one of the

969
00:41:36,819 --> 00:41:40,509
things that I wanted to point out is

970
00:41:38,439 --> 00:41:45,699
this behavior here which is lateral

971
00:41:40,509 --> 00:41:47,619
movement lateral movement has is using a

972
00:41:45,699 --> 00:41:51,789
technique or a type pattern called pass

973
00:41:47,619 --> 00:41:54,579
the hash now if you didn't have you know

974
00:41:51,789 --> 00:41:58,089
if I hadn't expanded this already then

975
00:41:54,579 --> 00:42:01,390
you would see that apt 28 does lateral

976
00:41:58,089 --> 00:42:02,469
movement and it uses no pasta hash but

977
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:04,330
by expanding it

978
00:42:02,469 --> 00:42:06,130
I've actually now seen

979
00:42:04,330 --> 00:42:08,830
two other actors are actually using

980
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:10,870
pasta hash as well and they are also

981
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:13,740
using it for a lateral movement and who

982
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:17,950
are they or that's a PT 29 an apt one

983
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:20,709
now but you might say while so wha

984
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:23,169
right while intelligence is about

985
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:25,860
informing action and informing how you

986
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:28,750
respond to that intelligence and

987
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:31,360
depending on your organization you may

988
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:34,510
decide to say I don't know what to do

989
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:37,060
with this but you may also be a more

990
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:40,390
sophisticated you know entity and you

991
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:43,690
say okay well let me go see where how I

992
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:46,120
detect lateral movement what what

993
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:48,280
defensive tools and controls do I have

994
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:50,589
in my environment for lateral movement

995
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:53,350
detection do I have a gap in my security

996
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:55,720
posture if I do this has just informed

997
00:42:53,350 --> 00:42:58,390
me that the relevance of that to your

998
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:00,970
environment do you have a vulnerability

999
00:42:58,390 --> 00:43:04,480
that pass the hash potentially exploits

1000
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:07,060
or that technique exploits you can start

1001
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,610
to use this intelligence to map it to

1002
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:13,000
your specific environment and your

1003
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:15,640
specific needs and understand your risk

1004
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:18,900
because ultimately intelligence is about

1005
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:22,060
driving risk and understanding how to

1006
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:24,760
respond to that and so hopefully you you

1007
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:27,640
see the point of why this is a you know

1008
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:33,580
really important so if I go back to

1009
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:35,710
slide mode so the second example is you

1010
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:37,930
know what I just pointed out in the live

1011
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:39,910
demo where you know once you start to

1012
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:41,919
understand all these actors and you see

1013
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:43,779
these you know behaviors you can start

1014
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,940
to see commonality and that allows you

1015
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:48,460
inform how to respond to it the more

1016
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:50,830
actors you see using a common technique

1017
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:54,310
that might help prioritize how you

1018
00:43:50,830 --> 00:43:57,670
respond to as well another example where

1019
00:43:54,310 --> 00:44:01,299
a PT 20 a PT one are actually doing data

1020
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:04,030
exfil with compression they may be using

1021
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:07,110
similar techniques in that regard and

1022
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:09,940
again it can inform how you respond so

1023
00:44:07,110 --> 00:44:12,070
want to move on from how you model

1024
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:15,340
things showing you a couple of examples

1025
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:16,800
how you model real-world reports but the

1026
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:18,840
really examples and I want

1027
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:20,400
walkabout taxi v2 taxi v2 is the

1028
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:24,450
application that allows you exchange

1029
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:26,970
intelligence between systems and 2002 is

1030
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:29,430
fundamentally different really than taxi

1031
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:33,299
v1 the first thing is the you know the

1032
00:44:29,430 --> 00:44:36,060
server advertises what what is on taxi

1033
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:39,510
to that construct is called apt routes

1034
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:43,620
it's a list of where the information is

1035
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:45,480
on taxi to an AP route is can be set up

1036
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:47,040
for an individual sharing community

1037
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:48,360
could be different you can have

1038
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,390
different routes for different sharing

1039
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:53,370
communities so if you have a you know a

1040
00:44:51,390 --> 00:44:55,879
particular centralized server that

1041
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:59,250
shared across you know say government

1042
00:44:55,880 --> 00:45:02,190
you know enterprise or vertical markets

1043
00:44:59,250 --> 00:45:04,740
as well as specific paid intelligence

1044
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:07,560
versus free intelligence you can use the

1045
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:09,660
same taxi server and have all of those

1046
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:11,040
different flexibilities on the same

1047
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:13,290
server so you don't need to set up

1048
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:15,509
separate servers you can actually all do

1049
00:45:13,290 --> 00:45:18,779
it in taxi - and there are some good

1050
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:21,630
reasons why taxi to try to do that one

1051
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:23,940
of the things that taxi two does is it

1052
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:26,640
has this construct of collection it's

1053
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:28,560
really just you know where they the the

1054
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:31,920
raw information is the the intelligence

1055
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:35,490
is you can do read-only which means that

1056
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:37,550
you can't write to it and why would you

1057
00:45:35,490 --> 00:45:41,729
have that that would typically be say

1058
00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:45,450
you know in the United States DHS has a

1059
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:47,070
sharing program called AIS and that is

1060
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:50,100
where they publish intelligence

1061
00:45:47,070 --> 00:45:52,710
information to you know to a broad set

1062
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:55,049
of you know vendors and organizations

1063
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:56,940
it's a read-only source of information

1064
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:59,250
that's not right in that particular

1065
00:45:56,940 --> 00:46:01,680
instance and so that would be a case

1066
00:45:59,250 --> 00:46:04,110
where you would have an entity such as

1067
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:06,629
DHS where as a read-only collection is

1068
00:46:04,110 --> 00:46:10,260
publishing the intelligence a right only

1069
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:11,490
collection is curiously you know some

1070
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,810
people might say well why would you have

1071
00:46:11,490 --> 00:46:15,779
a right only where you can't read it

1072
00:46:12,810 --> 00:46:18,210
well organize it this came about because

1073
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:20,700
of organizations like IBM security who's

1074
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:23,220
you know involved in a lot of this is -

1075
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:25,379
is like they wanted to be able to have

1076
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:28,230
systems that would post information to a

1077
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:29,570
taxi server but those systems were

1078
00:46:28,230 --> 00:46:32,030
posting it

1079
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:34,340
you know as a impute so it's being

1080
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:36,950
treated as here's information that then

1081
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:38,390
goes into a processing data queue that

1082
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:41,569
then gets processed and managed and

1083
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:44,060
correlated but that queue is never read

1084
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:46,130
from it's only read from that server

1085
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:48,230
after it's been processed and published

1086
00:46:46,130 --> 00:46:50,780
in a different place and so they wanted

1087
00:46:48,230 --> 00:46:53,600
the ability to have systems publish the

1088
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:55,610
information in a read-only way so that

1089
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:58,790
they can then be post processed then

1090
00:46:55,610 --> 00:47:00,170
there's obviously readwrite there's some

1091
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:03,230
constructs that are really important

1092
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:06,020
from taxi to filtering is a super

1093
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:08,090
critical because if you've got you know

1094
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:11,180
millions of indicators or millions of

1095
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:12,620
individual pieces of intelligence your

1096
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:14,450
system might not be able to handle that

1097
00:47:12,620 --> 00:47:17,029
much data and you need to be able to

1098
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:18,740
reduce the data set that is you're

1099
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:20,480
trying to get you might not even care

1100
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:23,299
about different types of data so you

1101
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:25,310
only care about say technical indicators

1102
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:27,800
or you only care about high-level

1103
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:29,990
campaigns so there is a way in tightly

1104
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:33,230
to to actually filter that information

1105
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:34,839
so that you can only ask for that type

1106
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:38,330
of information from that collection

1107
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:40,130
paging is another thing that you know if

1108
00:47:38,330 --> 00:47:42,290
you've built any kind of scalable

1109
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:45,830
application where you're communicating

1110
00:47:42,290 --> 00:47:47,600
across you know the a network you can't

1111
00:47:45,830 --> 00:47:49,640
assume that you're gonna get all of the

1112
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:52,279
information you're asking for and a

1113
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:55,160
single single request response even if

1114
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:57,530
it's a higher level protocol so taxi to

1115
00:47:55,160 --> 00:48:00,049
supports the ability to page information

1116
00:47:57,530 --> 00:48:01,820
so you can say I want all the

1117
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:05,030
information you have from this certain

1118
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:07,970
date but I can only handle a thousand at

1119
00:48:05,030 --> 00:48:11,240
a time and taxi to allows you to

1120
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:14,419
actually do that on an S on a per client

1121
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:16,040
basis so you know one client could say I

1122
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:17,870
can handle a thousand things at a time

1123
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:19,880
whereas our second client could say I

1124
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:23,470
want ten thousand things at times and

1125
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:26,360
taxi to allows you to be able to do that

1126
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:27,980
this is some of the API that you will

1127
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:31,790
actually see I want to talk through more

1128
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:34,850
details so but you know this is all the

1129
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:36,890
raw restful api so if you will so a

1130
00:48:34,850 --> 00:48:39,980
simple example

1131
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:42,200
if I want to discover a server the

1132
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:42,830
left-hand side is the client connecting

1133
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:45,169
to

1134
00:48:42,830 --> 00:48:47,360
the server and you see the response on

1135
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:49,580
the right-hand side there and I

1136
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:51,530
highlight heat the information that I

1137
00:48:49,580 --> 00:48:54,400
was just talking about with roots so in

1138
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:57,470
this case there's three roots ap 1 AP

1139
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:01,070
io2 and trust group 1 so there's three

1140
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:05,060
roots on the server the next one is okay

1141
00:49:01,070 --> 00:49:06,530
I'm interested in AP 1 what information

1142
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:07,730
is available here so I wanted to

1143
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:09,620
highlight something that's really

1144
00:49:07,730 --> 00:49:11,510
important which is when you connect to

1145
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:13,790
servers and clients this hours the

1146
00:49:11,510 --> 00:49:15,320
version control or version matching is

1147
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:18,320
really important otherwise it things

1148
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:20,150
just break so the ability for clients to

1149
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,770
determine what is on a server and vice

1150
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:24,140
versa is really important for

1151
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:26,660
compatibility and sticks to taxi to

1152
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:29,569
sorry Eliza as part of the basic

1153
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:32,120
negotiation that occurs at the beginning

1154
00:49:29,570 --> 00:49:33,650
of the communication you also see a

1155
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:36,560
parameter they are called my X content

1156
00:49:33,650 --> 00:49:39,320
length that tells the client what is the

1157
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:42,440
maximum content that the server is

1158
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:47,450
willing to support in either a get or a

1159
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:48,290
post so once you've discovered the list

1160
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:51,830
of API writs

1161
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:53,509
you got a specific API now you want to

1162
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:56,569
go to a specific collection which is

1163
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:58,270
where the information may be there's a

1164
00:49:56,570 --> 00:50:00,320
couple of things I wanted to point out

1165
00:49:58,270 --> 00:50:03,410
permissions which I already talked about

1166
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:05,420
it can be pair collection for all

1167
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:08,029
clients of that collection or you can

1168
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:10,310
actually say for that individual client

1169
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:12,440
that individual client only has read

1170
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:14,720
access it can't write but you can for

1171
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:18,230
this client it can be both read and

1172
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:20,540
write that is actually supported in a

1173
00:50:18,230 --> 00:50:23,330
generic way in the standard but it comes

1174
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:26,840
down to the implementation of the taxi

1175
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:28,880
server whether they support that no this

1176
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:31,490
is another key thing where you're able

1177
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,310
to do object retrieval based on the

1178
00:50:31,490 --> 00:50:36,290
filtering which I already talked about

1179
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:38,509
I'll skip this for a second posting

1180
00:50:36,290 --> 00:50:43,009
information to taxi to is really

1181
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:44,960
important and how well the data was

1182
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:47,990
posted is really important so if you're

1183
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:50,540
posting say 10,000 things 10,000

1184
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:52,580
indicators 10,000 intrusion says

1185
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:54,590
whatever it may be you want to know that

1186
00:50:52,580 --> 00:50:56,630
that taxi server actually processed

1187
00:50:54,590 --> 00:50:59,720
those 10,000 things correct

1188
00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:02,779
so taxi to has in the protocol an

1189
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:04,879
ability to say how many did I receive so

1190
00:51:02,779 --> 00:51:08,029
it confirms that you know if I know I

1191
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:10,339
sent 10,000 did it think I got 10,000 or

1192
00:51:08,029 --> 00:51:13,730
it got 10,000 so it can say that and

1193
00:51:10,339 --> 00:51:15,999
then how many were processed so that's

1194
00:51:13,730 --> 00:51:18,769
important because if I've got some

1195
00:51:15,999 --> 00:51:20,899
incorrectly formatted information the

1196
00:51:18,769 --> 00:51:22,819
server can actually communicate back to

1197
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:26,059
the client saying hey this information I

1198
00:51:22,819 --> 00:51:28,970
got 10,000 of them but one of them or

1199
00:51:26,059 --> 00:51:32,420
five of them were actually not processed

1200
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:35,209
correctly and they failed now the the

1201
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:37,279
protocol actually I allow this server to

1202
00:51:35,210 --> 00:51:39,499
communicate what were the failures not

1203
00:51:37,279 --> 00:51:41,930
just the number because if it was 10,000

1204
00:51:39,499 --> 00:51:43,220
things and it said five failed the next

1205
00:51:41,930 --> 00:51:45,859
question the client is going to want to

1206
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:48,019
know is well of that number what ones

1207
00:51:45,859 --> 00:51:53,299
are fail so there's some very real

1208
00:51:48,019 --> 00:51:56,779
practical products that matter so I want

1209
00:51:53,299 --> 00:52:01,160
to show you a demo so juniper Jupiter

1210
00:51:56,779 --> 00:52:05,029
notebook is a open source tool I'm going

1211
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:06,739
to run against taxi to server and you

1212
00:52:05,029 --> 00:52:08,930
know I wanted to show you go out of

1213
00:52:06,739 --> 00:52:16,730
screen mode and go to my browser again

1214
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:18,919
and so here this is a Python script you

1215
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:22,069
can see here this is the Jupiter

1216
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:23,450
notebook I wrote this script with you

1217
00:52:22,069 --> 00:52:25,759
know that I took some of the scripts

1218
00:52:23,450 --> 00:52:26,509
from a colleague I work in the standards

1219
00:52:25,759 --> 00:52:28,579
tree Dali

1220
00:52:26,509 --> 00:52:30,440
he wrote the original version and I can

1221
00:52:28,579 --> 00:52:33,259
i modified it for this trade show so

1222
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:36,079
thanks to tree but the key point here is

1223
00:52:33,259 --> 00:52:37,999
that you might look oh this just looks

1224
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:41,660
like code right well what you can

1225
00:52:37,999 --> 00:52:43,730
actually do is you hit run the initial

1226
00:52:41,660 --> 00:52:45,288
thing is I connect to the server I set

1227
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:47,839
up this server object I'm connecting to

1228
00:52:45,289 --> 00:52:50,450
uber taxi comm that is actually in the

1229
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:53,029
Internet if you had a taxi client you'd

1230
00:52:50,450 --> 00:52:55,368
be like oh there right now the password

1231
00:52:53,029 --> 00:52:58,849
is uber taxi and the password is there

1232
00:52:55,369 --> 00:53:02,150
they go to the next step I say okay what

1233
00:52:58,849 --> 00:53:04,430
is the title and thank luckily the

1234
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:06,950
internet continues to work so this is

1235
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:08,569
the title that you know is actually on

1236
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:11,239
that server right now

1237
00:53:08,569 --> 00:53:13,640
and it was received I go to the next

1238
00:53:11,239 --> 00:53:15,979
step and I say okay show me what API

1239
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:18,319
routes are on this taxi server and so

1240
00:53:15,979 --> 00:53:20,328
this cord is actually getting that data

1241
00:53:18,319 --> 00:53:22,160
back as I showed you on the slides you

1242
00:53:20,329 --> 00:53:24,979
know get get at API routes and now it's

1243
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:27,439
printing out each of the the taxi routes

1244
00:53:24,979 --> 00:53:32,899
are on that server and they get to the

1245
00:53:27,439 --> 00:53:34,519
next step I hit run and I'm specifically

1246
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:36,439
for this demo interested in the mitre

1247
00:53:34,519 --> 00:53:39,348
attack collection that's on that server

1248
00:53:36,439 --> 00:53:44,089
and so I find out which one that is and

1249
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:47,299
then I go to the next step and set up a

1250
00:53:44,089 --> 00:53:49,669
collection in you know Jupiter notebook

1251
00:53:47,299 --> 00:53:52,160
and then say okay how many results are

1252
00:53:49,669 --> 00:53:54,650
in that collection there's 60 from mitre

1253
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:59,239
small number but for this demo is good

1254
00:53:54,650 --> 00:54:02,479
I'm specifically interested in 36 which

1255
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:06,529
is more fee I then want to iterate

1256
00:54:02,479 --> 00:54:09,069
through the relationships and hopefully

1257
00:54:06,529 --> 00:54:09,069
it comes back

1258
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:21,460
oh there you go find two relationships

1259
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:24,380
and then I run the last step and so that

1260
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:26,630
collection has more fee and as to

1261
00:54:24,380 --> 00:54:29,180
relationships that have binary pot

1262
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:31,850
padding and Powys Navi and that was

1263
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:34,549
actually this client open source client

1264
00:54:31,850 --> 00:54:35,810
in Jupiter notebook encourage you to get

1265
00:54:34,550 --> 00:54:38,420
familiar with it because it's a really

1266
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:41,210
useful tool to kind of learn how to use

1267
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:43,400
sticks and taxi version two and it was

1268
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:47,390
talking to in this case the uber taxi

1269
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:49,970
server there's multiple public servers

1270
00:54:47,390 --> 00:54:52,549
on the internet that you know the

1271
00:54:49,970 --> 00:54:54,740
community have been postings of so that

1272
00:54:52,550 --> 00:54:56,720
people can learn how to use taxi too so

1273
00:54:54,740 --> 00:55:01,910
if you have questions about either this

1274
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:03,799
one or others they'll let me know and I

1275
00:55:01,910 --> 00:55:08,270
think I've got about five minutes left I

1276
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:12,220
just want to quickly mention six

1277
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:15,350
preferred so one of the challenges with

1278
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:17,600
Styx version one was that it was easy

1279
00:55:15,350 --> 00:55:20,360
for any event or organization to say the

1280
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:22,759
supported Styx that was literally that

1281
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:25,760
they would say yep I support Styx and

1282
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:27,980
people would believe them however when

1283
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:31,010
you come to do things like connect

1284
00:55:27,980 --> 00:55:33,050
products together like a tip talking to

1285
00:55:31,010 --> 00:55:35,630
an end point system that claims takes

1286
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:38,390
one then they wouldn't work and the

1287
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:40,490
people who were frustrated without where

1288
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:41,870
joint customers or people who are trying

1289
00:55:40,490 --> 00:55:44,120
to use products from different

1290
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:46,069
organizations and so sticks to has

1291
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:47,870
focused and created a new cell era

1292
00:55:46,070 --> 00:55:51,830
fication program called Styx preferred

1293
00:55:47,870 --> 00:55:55,310
where organizations can submit their

1294
00:55:51,830 --> 00:55:57,830
products for certification and once they

1295
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:59,600
pass they get a badge that says they are

1296
00:55:57,830 --> 00:56:02,779
Styx preferred certified and it actually

1297
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:05,720
lists different personas so this is the

1298
00:56:02,780 --> 00:56:08,540
URL where where the portal is you can

1299
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:10,009
see who's actually got the certification

1300
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:11,660
so far there's none because we just

1301
00:56:10,010 --> 00:56:13,640
launched it but the key point is

1302
00:56:11,660 --> 00:56:16,399
organizations can submit the product and

1303
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:17,779
as if you're a consumer who's interested

1304
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:20,030
in what products out there are Styx

1305
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:21,560
preferred then you'll be able to go this

1306
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:24,890
portal and I'll actually list the

1307
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:27,230
products there's a whole lot of testing

1308
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:28,400
and test documents are defined

1309
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:31,030
you know if you're interested in the

1310
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:33,560
details cause you look it up we've

1311
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:34,280
understood the market in terms of

1312
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:36,200
personas

1313
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:38,390
so we've it's not just you know tips

1314
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:41,120
it's also things like data feed

1315
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:42,859
providers Sims taxi servers threat

1316
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:45,049
mitigation system detection systems

1317
00:56:42,860 --> 00:56:47,240
intelligence think all of these personas

1318
00:56:45,050 --> 00:56:49,460
are common things are in the industry

1319
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:52,009
things like firewalls IPS so we've

1320
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:53,690
modeled how sticks would be represent in

1321
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:55,760
each of these product categories and

1322
00:56:53,690 --> 00:56:57,350
then we've defined for that product

1323
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,390
category what are the requirements on

1324
00:56:57,350 --> 00:57:02,299
how it either produces or consumed

1325
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:04,310
sticks or both and so if they get the

1326
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:07,010
certification for sticks prefer for that

1327
00:57:04,310 --> 00:57:09,590
persona then you if you're a consuming

1328
00:57:07,010 --> 00:57:12,560
organization you know that that product

1329
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:14,810
has met a certain level of quality way

1330
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:17,240
before you know n61 they used to say our

1331
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:19,580
sticks v1 yeah I'm compatible and it

1332
00:57:17,240 --> 00:57:21,979
meant absolutely nothing we're changing

1333
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:26,150
the bar here to make it much harder to

1334
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:27,620
say you're compatible I'll skip over it

1335
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:29,780
you know we've we focused on data

1336
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:31,970
behaviors and completeness so it's not

1337
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:33,890
just specific elements of testing we've

1338
00:57:31,970 --> 00:57:36,709
I we actually expect the whole thing to

1339
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:39,319
be testing behaviors and data and with

1340
00:57:36,710 --> 00:57:42,140
that I will try and wrap up so here's

1341
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:45,670
some links for information around oasis

1342
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:49,040
which is the standards organization is

1343
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:50,600
pushing sticks in taxi the subcommittee

1344
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,580
that I was just talking about which

1345
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:57,020
takes preferred that's the one I

1346
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:59,870
co-chair is there if you are interested

1347
00:57:57,020 --> 00:58:02,090
in the specifications either the stakes

1348
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:04,730
taxi or sticks preferred specifications

1349
00:58:02,090 --> 00:58:07,010
that's the link there and there's also a

1350
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:10,130
list of open API sand repos some of the

1351
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:14,030
tools that I just showed you are of your

1352
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:16,880
reference there and with that I will

1353
00:58:14,030 --> 00:58:18,890
thank you for your time and I don't know

1354
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:21,650
if I have time for questions any

1355
00:58:18,890 --> 00:58:22,839
questions time I know it's like up I

1356
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:25,550
have a question

1357
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:27,610
be quick because everybody's dying to

1358
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:30,350
eat sure

1359
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:32,870
sticks objects that you referenced audio

1360
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:35,450
they can be ingested or pushed out right

1361
00:58:32,870 --> 00:58:37,640
yeah platforms that platforms tend to

1362
00:58:35,450 --> 00:58:39,288
support a lot more ingestion then the

1363
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,578
in terms of pushing they don't push out

1364
00:58:39,289 --> 00:58:44,809
all objects but they didn't happily

1365
00:58:40,579 --> 00:58:47,269
ingest most of them so is that is that

1366
00:58:44,809 --> 00:58:49,039
something you see fixing itself in the

1367
00:58:47,269 --> 00:58:50,419
industry over a longer time period or is

1368
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:52,400
that something that with your

1369
00:58:50,420 --> 00:58:56,720
certification programs you see earlier

1370
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:58,490
into in the near future so if I if I

1371
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,868
think I understand your question is what

1372
00:58:58,490 --> 00:59:02,629
you're saying is that you know some

1373
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:06,079
systems are able to consume way more

1374
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:08,750
data types of data than produce data so

1375
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:10,430
sticks you to implement sticks to you

1376
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:12,049
don't have to support all of the

1377
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:14,029
flexibility or all the different types

1378
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:16,069
of things that sticks to does if you're

1379
00:59:14,029 --> 00:59:17,779
a firewall and you only care about one

1380
00:59:16,069 --> 00:59:19,819
specific type of technical indicator

1381
00:59:17,779 --> 00:59:22,160
that's all you need to support and that

1382
00:59:19,819 --> 00:59:23,900
sticks preferred actually assumes that

1383
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:26,149
if you want to you want to get sticks

1384
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:28,099
preferred certification for a firewall

1385
00:59:26,150 --> 00:59:29,299
you only need to support the things that

1386
00:59:28,099 --> 00:59:31,130
make sense for a file well you don't

1387
00:59:29,299 --> 00:59:33,170
have to support things like you know a

1388
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:35,329
higher level campaign or intrusion set

1389
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:36,470
which a firewall would like and what

1390
00:59:35,329 --> 00:59:39,289
what the hell does that mean

1391
00:59:36,470 --> 00:59:42,500
whereas if you're a tip then typically

1392
00:59:39,289 --> 00:59:44,059
tips must represent all the different

1393
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,500
types of intelligence because they

1394
00:59:44,059 --> 00:59:48,650
typically allow you to create all of

1395
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:50,180
that as well as consume it so so that is

1396
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:51,380
very much part of sticks to the

1397
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:53,328
assumption that you don't have to

1398
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:59,029
support everything in one place okay

1399
00:59:53,329 --> 01:00:01,400
thanks okay Hey any other questions

1400
00:59:59,029 --> 01:00:04,160
if you're interested in discussing more

1401
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:06,799
you don't want to ask in this forum I'm

1402
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:10,098
here this afternoon we have a booth I'll

1403
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:11,869
be sit by the booth you know my goal

1404
01:00:10,099 --> 01:00:14,210
with presenting here is to actually

1405
01:00:11,869 --> 01:00:17,930
encourage the industry to adopt

1406
01:00:14,210 --> 01:00:19,819
standards and you know I fundamentally

1407
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:21,950
believe that that's how we actually

1408
01:00:19,819 --> 01:00:25,009
start taking the fight back to actors

1409
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:26,509
who are they're able to succeed and I

1410
01:00:25,009 --> 01:00:28,400
think we need to start using something

1411
01:00:26,509 --> 01:00:30,980
you know some standards like this that

1412
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:33,859
really help us work together to actually

1413
01:00:30,980 --> 01:00:35,779
get back at the actors who are trying to

1414
01:00:33,859 --> 01:00:39,109
exploit us so I encourage you to embrace

1415
01:00:35,779 --> 01:00:41,029
standards and ask questions thank you

1416
01:00:39,109 --> 01:00:43,089
very much

1417
01:00:41,029 --> 01:00:43,089
you
