1
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:10,690
moving on to our next discussion seesaw

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,870
strategy for ot and IOT risk and threat

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:18,480
management for this we have our

4
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:18,480
moderator Gaurav Shukla from Deloitte

5
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:54,160
and panelist Sudarshan rajagopal from

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:59,250
shell commitment from Vedanta Rakesh

7
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,250
wish nothing from cyber built thank you

8
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,690
[Music]

9
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,800
[Music]

10
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:21,929
thank you very much good afternoon

11
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:24,520
everybody

12
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,229
good afternoon all of us had lunch

13
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:29,158
didn't we

14
00:01:25,229 --> 00:01:33,400
right bring some energy all right so

15
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,780
first of all I think and I think we

16
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,240
should all put our hands together for

17
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:39,909
the organizers who have set up us such a

18
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,610
beautiful platform for us over last two

19
00:01:39,909 --> 00:01:43,990
days to exchange what is happening new

20
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,909
in technology what are the new cyber

21
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:47,710
trends which are coming in and the

22
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:50,820
atmosphere has been electric so let's

23
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,820
let's give them an applause

24
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:58,859
and I personally was was very very

25
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:00,569
blessed I've been very happy to see the

26
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:03,419
young and younger crowd younger by the

27
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:05,549
way I'm referring to myself to see such

28
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:07,229
a enthusiasm in relation to

29
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:09,179
cybersecurity new trends which are

30
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:11,160
happening there participating in so many

31
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:13,290
CTF contests and the cyber quizzes all

32
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,109
around the booth it was a beautiful

33
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:18,780
sight to look at if you look at over the

34
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:20,459
last two or three years the evolution of

35
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,090
technology has been precedent

36
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:26,370
unprecedented can you imagine a day

37
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,410
without your mobile phone how many of

38
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:32,099
you can imagine a day without a mobile

39
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:34,410
phone I can't can imagine it would be

40
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:36,090
dreadful that's where that's that's

41
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:39,329
where the risk management console all

42
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:42,269
right and see how many of you have

43
00:02:39,329 --> 00:02:44,340
encountered a situation where something

44
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:47,069
you are not able to locate at home and

45
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:50,099
that you think why the damn thing does

46
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:52,980
not have a calling feature in it yeah

47
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:55,200
right so so and then look at the view

48
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,630
you after work you come back home and

49
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,700
then ask Alexa turn on the music that

50
00:02:57,630 --> 00:03:01,739
you like it does it is it that they're a

51
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:03,690
beautiful experience technology's made

52
00:03:01,739 --> 00:03:07,829
it happen for you you're driving a car

53
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:09,510
right and and you are about to pay for

54
00:03:07,829 --> 00:03:11,670
the premium then you say okay my premium

55
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,888
is going to be X amount certainly your

56
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:16,950
insurer gives you a call your premium

57
00:03:13,889 --> 00:03:19,349
has gone up by some percentages why

58
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:21,268
because you have been driving Rash right

59
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:22,608
can you imagine that the changes in

60
00:03:21,269 --> 00:03:25,319
which is happening in technology

61
00:03:22,609 --> 00:03:28,349
similarly in the plants or manufacturing

62
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:31,828
industries etc who had ever imagined

63
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:34,018
that those PLC the the big units appeals

64
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:36,000
it can ever come to these cyber centers

65
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:38,010
or sock securio operation centers for

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,280
monitoring purposes technology made it

67
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:43,260
possible so if you look at we are living

68
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,500
in the world where the technology is

69
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:49,168
leading a life therefore it becomes very

70
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:51,060
important to understand how technology

71
00:03:49,169 --> 00:03:52,530
is leading a life and what are the

72
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,260
components which are comprising this

73
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:58,680
technology so IOT and ot which is

74
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,420
industrial IOT also is is where all of

75
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,659
it is becoming very possible technology

76
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:05,069
the trends say is that by end of 2020

77
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,858
there would be

78
00:04:05,069 --> 00:04:10,708
three times IOT devices on the earth

79
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:13,709
than the number of human beings so it's

80
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:15,840
phenomenal so what are we going to do

81
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,840
over the next few minutes is to

82
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,399
brainstorm with our eminent panel and

83
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:23,489
understand from them what their thoughts

84
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:25,859
on dealing with the risk that do come in

85
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:28,590
with the changes that has happened in

86
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:31,889
technology which is enabled by IOT and

87
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:34,739
OD per se we're going to be making very

88
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:36,780
interactive I'm not going to go and bore

89
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,199
you with my boring questions thrown at

90
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:42,419
any one of them you all please feel free

91
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,310
to ask any questions it is not going to

92
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:46,049
be that after 5:00 in towards the end of

93
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:48,240
five minutes I'm going to say okay floor

94
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:51,389
is open for asking questions ask from

95
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,840
the word go now before I start I thought

96
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:56,639
I'll just give ask each one of them to

97
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,859
give their perspective as to what they

98
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,680
think where the risk comes from and this

99
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:04,560
IOT and ot enable environment and what

100
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,539
are some of the basic steps that a chief

101
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,449
information security officer should be

102
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:11,039
looking at should be consider while he

103
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:13,110
or she is preparing for this strategy

104
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,630
for the next two to three years so so

105
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:17,430
that should why don't we start with you

106
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:22,289
thank you go and that was quite an

107
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:24,690
insightful opening thank you so I think

108
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:27,479
let's let's start from a private life

109
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:29,130
and move it to the to the industry where

110
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:31,380
I am and I would I would like to take it

111
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,699
that way simple reason because he

112
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:34,770
started with you know certain very

113
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:36,360
interesting facts when he said how do

114
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,758
you demand day without a telephone

115
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:41,669
without his cell phone or if you lose

116
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:43,560
something and you instantly feel why

117
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:45,389
kind I went tracking system on that and

118
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,729
the suit that's so real that's like real

119
00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:50,370
issues what you look at it and something

120
00:05:47,729 --> 00:05:53,190
flashed in my head wouldn't like to say

121
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:55,620
that but yeah most of you all might have

122
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,659
seen the movie Rudy and it was a there

123
00:05:55,620 --> 00:06:00,180
was a mention somewhere that the nurse

124
00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:02,580
of the supposed nose says that I had put

125
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:03,690
in tracking devices on all the and

126
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:05,099
that's a very good thing for an

127
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:06,659
Alzheimer's patient because I've seen

128
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:08,969
them up close in person and that's

129
00:06:06,659 --> 00:06:11,659
that's something very good so that is a

130
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:14,190
very good feature when it comes to IOT

131
00:06:11,659 --> 00:06:16,169
the flip side of that from a private

132
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:18,910
life perspective is how many times would

133
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:21,330
you want your locations to be

134
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:23,770
by people and a very good example was

135
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:26,260
Fitbit which had location-tracking

136
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:29,349
released the data of one of the most

137
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:32,320
secure areas in u.s. of US base

138
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:34,630
somewhere in the Middle East globally

139
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,469
because the all the military personnel's

140
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,820
were wearing that and they were

141
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:38,530
comparing each other how they're doing

142
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:41,349
so you know this this is the flip side

143
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:44,229
of it how do you how we intelligently

144
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:46,810
use it when we use it and what we need

145
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:48,550
is what you look at it and if I go back

146
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:51,220
to a very interesting example there was

147
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:53,650
this social media group called as Orkut

148
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:54,910
I don't know how many of you know my

149
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:56,140
grandfather used to tell me there was

150
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,830
something like that I have never been on

151
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:00,520
that platform

152
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:02,740
apparently in that you could you could

153
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,090
go to anyone's so it was crap like what

154
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:05,260
you have wall on Facebook it had

155
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:08,070
something called a scrap and you could

156
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:10,780
go in scrap to any one can we be France

157
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:12,640
yeah hey beautiful what's your name and

158
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:14,590
then you get irritated people could

159
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,590
download your photo and create a fake

160
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:19,359
profile not that it's not happening now

161
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:22,119
what Facebook button was feature of

162
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,100
security you had the same evil but you

163
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,170
could control it much better and that's

164
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:28,150
what I would be looking at IOT going

165
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:30,820
forward and using it in a perfect way

166
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:34,030
the way we use it in the industry is

167
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:35,860
very similar now PLC of the old old

168
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:38,739
technologies what we have is coming to

169
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:41,170
the cyber room how do we test test it

170
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:43,210
how do we locate it who all can see it

171
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:45,100
if we can see it something like what we

172
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:47,229
have is the is the fleet of trucks which

173
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:48,940
are going can be looked from shodhan is

174
00:07:47,230 --> 00:07:51,430
it good is it safe for us if you are

175
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:53,530
targeted in various areas should that

176
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,940
should that be in shorten or should that

177
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:57,580
be private that is something you should

178
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,230
look at so these are the from I'm just

179
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:00,849
talking from one of the previously areas

180
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,590
which which I look at it and I think

181
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:05,860
that's that's something which is which I

182
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:07,390
would primarily look at it the other way

183
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,680
of looking at it is the authentication

184
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,750
or the brute forcing now this is a

185
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,280
device what you're talking about does it

186
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,120
have the right policy right from the

187
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,159
beginning does it have the right

188
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,350
architecture right from the beginning or

189
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:20,860
can you brute force it if someone gets a

190
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:23,140
hand on it I was attending the EVM does

191
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:25,720
they see to guard kind of one of these

192
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:27,310
sessions and how well if you have a

193
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,080
physical access what can you do with

194
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,520
these devices what which belongs to your

195
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,348
company and how can you get into the

196
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,208
company what are the vital information

197
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:37,300
which you can get from there but a few

198
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:39,458
areas which I think I would be looking

199
00:08:37,299 --> 00:08:41,708
forward for City thanks so they should

200
00:08:39,458 --> 00:08:43,059
go with some of your insights based on

201
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:45,008
your what your experience has been

202
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:48,459
setting up the Roper structure in your

203
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:50,380
organization or otherwise so I would

204
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:54,430
also want to you know start off with the

205
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:56,620
how IOT has changed our personal lives

206
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:58,630
because that's where people start to

207
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:01,930
understand you know how IOT is creating

208
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:04,389
a difference a lot of these devices that

209
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:06,758
we use today are IOT enabled you mention

210
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:10,060
Alexa Alexa is an example of an IOT

211
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:12,279
device so we all know what these devices

212
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:16,439
are capable of in the personal space

213
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:18,550
however when you come to industrial IOT

214
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,759
they're not that powerful

215
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:25,959
so when it comes to the security of

216
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:27,730
these devices I would say that you know

217
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:29,709
some certain terms that you don't hear

218
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:31,480
in the IT world start applying like

219
00:09:29,709 --> 00:09:34,599
there is a P dose permanent

220
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:37,569
denial-of-service you know you make the

221
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,970
device dead by attacking permanently so

222
00:09:37,569 --> 00:09:43,060
the while there are new terms coming in

223
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:45,190
a lot of times the modes will still

224
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:48,489
remain the same the kind of threats will

225
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:50,949
remain similar if not the same and at

226
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:53,170
the same time the protection mechanism

227
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:54,699
what you need to do or what you know

228
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:56,979
controls or the thought process that you

229
00:09:54,699 --> 00:10:00,790
need to build around it also a managed

230
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:02,500
from the very same source of CIA I mean

231
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:03,880
you start from there you know what I

232
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,740
need to do to prevent the

233
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:09,069
confidentiality to protect the integrity

234
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:11,139
and availability of information and to

235
00:10:09,069 --> 00:10:14,319
top it all we need to also see you know

236
00:10:11,139 --> 00:10:17,560
what kind of devices we have to put for

237
00:10:14,319 --> 00:10:19,449
what purpose you know is it within field

238
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:23,469
communication then you will need to put

239
00:10:19,449 --> 00:10:26,620
up a certain device which is maybe part

240
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:28,930
of a fog network so some things that you

241
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:33,550
need to think differently but from when

242
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:35,138
you come to security while I said CIA is

243
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:38,319
equally important and it's remain the

244
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:41,410
same you would also want to think

245
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:43,899
differently because of the way these

246
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:45,260
devices interact with each other the way

247
00:10:43,899 --> 00:10:47,630
these devices have been

248
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:51,860
today form factor with the limitations

249
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:53,510
and capabilities in security and push

250
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,100
for getting the right kind of

251
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:57,050
technologies in place at this point of

252
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:00,470
time thank you very much

253
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:03,339
so from your perspective you know what

254
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:06,530
are the some of the trends I'm slightly

255
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:07,850
deviating from the conventional question

256
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:09,500
that I posed to both of them what are

257
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:12,590
some of the challenging trends that you

258
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:14,960
seeing and how do you think the the

259
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,640
current landscape of the products or

260
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,500
maybe these services which are coming up

261
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,449
as a bundle as a package can deal with

262
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:23,390
some of those challenges in industrial

263
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:27,070
IOT space per se good afternoon everyone

264
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:27,069
first of all thanks for having me here

265
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:31,819
it's a very good question because I

266
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,160
could I am NOT a CIO so I cannot talk

267
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:37,820
about what is the trends and all this

268
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:41,209
stuff but I could give the question

269
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:43,640
exactly so first of all before going

270
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:45,950
forward I just met with couple of

271
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:47,780
youngsters and I had a great chat with

272
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:49,760
them just want to understand the crowd

273
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:52,250
before I answer this point so that it's

274
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,290
relevant for you all how many of you are

275
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:59,150
stock analysts here is there any stock

276
00:11:54,290 --> 00:12:01,550
analyst here or stock analyst right few

277
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:05,959
of them here few of them here and you

278
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:08,569
you handle IT ah let's both is there

279
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:13,670
anybody who who's here in this forum who

280
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:15,470
touches ot ah let's specifically yeah

281
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:18,500
one gentleman over here so this is

282
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:20,770
exactly the problem is so the IT OT

283
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,330
convergence is something that we are

284
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:25,579
currently talking about but which is not

285
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:28,730
yet happen so if you go to the industry

286
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:30,950
and if you look into the size of a big

287
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:33,770
force or anyone for that matter there

288
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:35,870
are only very very few say for example

289
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:39,590
they loiters as a matter of fact are the

290
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:42,800
only big tanks are the only one who

291
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:44,900
touches ot allas apart from that there

292
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:47,719
is nobody that you can send out Cote

293
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:49,610
alerts and ot others are not meant to be

294
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,090
sent out because because once you send

295
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:53,390
out

296
00:12:50,090 --> 00:12:55,730
I mean it's vulnerable right so there

297
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:57,670
are a lot of people lot of service

298
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:59,140
providers MSS piece who

299
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:01,390
who can walk up to you and say that I

300
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:04,000
can handle your IT but we have not

301
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:05,590
reached that point yet where somebody

302
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,630
can come and tell you that I can handle

303
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:10,660
your ot and it's been out so she ate so

304
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:14,050
this is one of the major major wave

305
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:15,880
which is there in the industry and the

306
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:17,410
second thing I don't know whether that I

307
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,770
should be telling this in this forum but

308
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:23,230
that's the truth of the fact is IT

309
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:27,819
people don't understand ot and ot people

310
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:30,100
don't understand I yeah true yeah it is

311
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:32,320
yes which is so true and it's nothing

312
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:34,900
wrong about it because and why should

313
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:36,520
somebody know everything right so if I'm

314
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:38,230
a sales there I go to my numbers right

315
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,280
that's what I know I don't know what is

316
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:40,510
happening in develop and what's

317
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:42,280
happening and engineering what is

318
00:13:40,510 --> 00:13:43,930
happening in all the other departments

319
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:48,459
around me or marketing for that matter

320
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:52,030
right so the matter of fact is the IT OT

321
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:55,330
convergence is happening and it will

322
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:58,180
happen the only thing is either IT is

323
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:59,920
going to own it and ot is going to

324
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:02,469
accept that IT is going to own it

325
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,870
if the is the debate which is going on

326
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:07,630
right now that's that's that's what is a

327
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:09,940
great I thought we can say it physical

328
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:11,470
meets digital meets physical right yeah

329
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:14,800
so there's a convergence which is

330
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:15,970
happening so I'll just draw go meets

331
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:20,500
attention or at the point that he

332
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:22,390
mentioned that not to literally mention

333
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:25,180
it that IT guys don't understand

334
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:27,790
ot and the other way also is true but

335
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,319
then in your organization I'm sure you

336
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:32,770
would have come across such difficulty

337
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:34,360
such challenge to explain to the the

338
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:37,240
people in the in the minds in the

339
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:41,230
factory to to why it is important to

340
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:42,760
embrace security and what it is if it is

341
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,680
not dealt with in the right manner what

342
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,780
what could be the repercussions of it

343
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,880
and then providing some level of control

344
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:51,430
back to the IT people for the monitoring

345
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:53,200
purpose for alert understanding purposes

346
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:56,410
so how did you deal with this challenge

347
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:59,140
when you you are hit upon this so fairly

348
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:02,949
well pointed out ot folks are very

349
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:06,309
territorial they don't want to leave

350
00:15:02,949 --> 00:15:09,229
but what he's mentioning that IT folks

351
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:12,499
don't know T and ot folks don't know IT

352
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:14,749
that's 2014 I think that's when we first

353
00:15:12,499 --> 00:15:16,369
started auditing they didn't know us we

354
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:18,199
didn't know them first time we sent an

355
00:15:16,369 --> 00:15:20,300
auditor it was like you know what are

356
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:22,040
you doing in my area and why are you

357
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,809
using your IT tools and that's when the

358
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:26,719
auditors were also not sure what to do

359
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:30,800
at least for us so they did an IT audit

360
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:32,839
or 40 systems after that after a few

361
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,829
iterations we also realized something is

362
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:39,040
not right here

363
00:15:33,829 --> 00:15:42,410
you know people keep talking about PLC's

364
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:46,089
controller sensors actuators and all we

365
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:48,469
see in our audit report is MS 17:10

366
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:51,110
Microsoft reliability switch related

367
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:53,389
vulnerability something is not right so

368
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:53,689
we decided that you know enough is

369
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:58,249
enough

370
00:15:53,689 --> 00:16:00,949
we formed a forum and that was 2017 when

371
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:03,470
we had people sharing accountabilities

372
00:16:00,949 --> 00:16:06,469
from the production divisions from the

373
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:08,629
project's division and IT so IT got a

374
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:11,029
seat as a functional assuming but that's

375
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:13,279
what that about that was kind of it at

376
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:15,139
that point in time that you know if they

377
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:17,300
need an advice it would be more of a

378
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:19,129
pool they will call us otherwise I mean

379
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:21,349
we can be at the bay they were very

380
00:16:19,129 --> 00:16:24,649
territorial about it but in the last one

381
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:26,209
year because the attention of our

382
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:29,720
internal audit function has also shifted

383
00:16:26,209 --> 00:16:31,910
towards the OT security we are being

384
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,499
called more often and sometimes it feels

385
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:36,679
like you know when something will go

386
00:16:33,499 --> 00:16:40,370
wrong they'll find me to be accountable

387
00:16:36,679 --> 00:16:42,860
for it somehow but we've been there now

388
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:45,019
and we've been pushing you know common

389
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:47,029
standards of learning as a matter of

390
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:49,069
fact I am just coming back from the site

391
00:16:47,029 --> 00:16:50,660
where we had this engagement with the

392
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:52,040
instrumentation team the control room

393
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:54,370
ingenious I was talking about

394
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:57,259
cybersecurity in the OT area with them

395
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:59,540
the push has been such that the IT

396
00:16:57,259 --> 00:17:01,549
people are now cross trained into ot in

397
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:04,750
some ways like I am a GI CSP certified

398
00:17:01,549 --> 00:17:07,520
person same ways ot folks we are sending

399
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,750
4ch so you know we're doing we're trying

400
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,158
to do that we're trying to bridge that

401
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:12,589
gap so that we can have a common

402
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:15,340
language or understanding at the end of

403
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:18,550
the day ownership for overall

404
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:22,240
we'll be with the OT folks for our

405
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:24,339
enterprise but the there will be a

406
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,920
confluence and there would be more and

407
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:29,230
more SME relay level information passing

408
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,880
from us to the OT folks that's happening

409
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:32,710
great you made it with two very good

410
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:35,080
points the common language of

411
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:36,960
understanding in relation to cyber

412
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:40,210
threats because cyber threats are

413
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:42,610
equally dangerous on either territory

414
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:44,700
whether it is ID or ot and the other

415
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:47,889
thing I think you mentioned was a common

416
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:49,930
standard of practices or or I'll just

417
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:51,730
give a different flavor common standard

418
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:53,410
for risk management let's say right so

419
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:55,270
so when you apply that common risk

420
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:57,400
management standard both as well.i T as

421
00:17:55,270 --> 00:18:00,430
well as ot I think the comprehension as

422
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:03,310
far as risk perseverance is concerned it

423
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:05,530
becomes you know quite palatable on both

424
00:18:03,310 --> 00:18:08,080
sides and therefore the engagement

425
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:09,910
becomes much more smoother you did

426
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:13,689
mention about I I printed that that was

427
00:18:09,910 --> 00:18:15,880
a bit of a funny robic although it was

428
00:18:13,690 --> 00:18:18,730
quite sarcastic when you said that we

429
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:21,040
did IT audit of ot systems so I thought

430
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:22,360
well I just pulled a solution here

431
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:25,450
before I just throw it open for the

432
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,820
audience in his previous of that before

433
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:30,610
taking over the current role and as risk

434
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:32,139
and controls advise delete for shell he

435
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:35,379
was also global well early management

436
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:38,340
lis for for shell so I thought you know

437
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:41,140
I also seek some of his views on

438
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:45,850
carrying out vulnerability management

439
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:47,920
related exercise in ot territory and/or

440
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:49,590
PCD for that matter and what has been

441
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:52,330
some of the interesting challenges that

442
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:55,659
were encountered there so that the

443
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:59,290
first answer you get is no you can't

444
00:18:55,660 --> 00:19:01,360
touch it it is difficult it's very

445
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:03,070
sensitive system there's a very old you

446
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,929
do not know what you're touching if you

447
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:07,240
touch it somewhere wrong it might just

448
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:10,810
burst so that's the first thing what you

449
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:13,270
hear across we could do a few of the

450
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:15,370
sites which were getting reengineering

451
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:17,770
places like that so we could do a few

452
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:21,100
tests and we found phenomenal stuff I

453
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:22,750
mean phenomenal for a hacker I think

454
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:24,939
that's like the gold mine that's like a

455
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:27,580
platinum mine that's like uranium right

456
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:28,250
it was it was like pleasure for us and

457
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,290
be

458
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:32,300
deep and deep indeed but the best part

459
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:34,310
of what resolved it was that the other

460
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,990
party I don't know if it was stopped

461
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:38,270
round driven or whatever the other party

462
00:19:35,990 --> 00:19:40,790
was also ready and willing to listen to

463
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:42,500
what needs to be done while saying that

464
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:44,720
as one part of it that there are certain

465
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:48,170
practical challenges if if the devices

466
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:51,140
are not updated for a very long time to

467
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:53,270
patch it to remediate it is a Herculean

468
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:56,030
task and business can't wait till then

469
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:57,500
so these are certain you know flavours I

470
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:59,360
think which I can throw in the open

471
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:02,030
right now which we faced about but yeah

472
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,590
it I mean you don't know what you find

473
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:05,090
there and once you find that it it's

474
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:07,310
like you know craving for knowledge and

475
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:08,810
going snowballs after that and that's

476
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:10,879
what we looked into when we when we

477
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:12,320
cannot interpret sure thanks solution so

478
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:14,570
as I promised

479
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,310
I just took initial ten minutes maybe

480
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:18,580
I'm just throwing it open for all of you

481
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:21,379
I know it is a topic of great interest

482
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:24,260
feel free to ask the panel any question

483
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:28,870
I'm sure none of the moderator would

484
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:32,840
have given you such a pleasure use it

485
00:20:28,870 --> 00:20:50,600
Greg or together I had some OD people I

486
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:55,639
mean question is have we really improved

487
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:57,770
anything on the security side so I think

488
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:59,360
that I would take the answer I don't

489
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:01,220
know I mean this is my my personal

490
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,070
opinion about it yes

491
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:05,840
ot has been there forever and I think

492
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,939
for the largest period of time we were

493
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:10,040
running as we say that nothing's

494
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:11,750
happened right nothing's gone wrong no

495
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:15,080
one is snatching it why to get it done

496
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:16,760
I think the way I look at it this ite

497
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:20,360
has gone into a majority level of

498
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:22,190
security and the you know the way the

499
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,500
format's are the way you can remediate

500
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:26,870
wake and find and that cycle is pretty

501
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,580
mature the other part of which now

502
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:31,010
people are looking at and it's also an

503
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:33,800
IT kind of an electronic area which can

504
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:35,629
be manipulated is the OTA area and

505
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,730
suddenly for last so many years I think

506
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:40,820
five seven years you're seeing a shift

507
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:41,840
of ot security so this this goes back to

508
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:43,700
you know how you started

509
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,240
information security an IT itself in

510
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:48,860
late 90s early 2000 where a firewall was

511
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:51,200
considered as the best solution to

512
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:54,590
getting into what you have today is a is

513
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:57,500
a you know the tour of this I devices

514
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:59,149
what you have the share arts of services

515
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,620
which you run every day these are the

516
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:02,059
kind of things what you look at from an

517
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:03,620
IT perspective and that's what you would

518
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:06,110
be looking at ot at some point in time

519
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,939
so I think it's a it's a journey and we

520
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:09,439
will reach there I know not much has

521
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:11,779
been done but I am sure we will reach

522
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,909
there ok Rakesh al Gomez would you like

523
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:17,899
to add to that so I would definitely say

524
00:22:13,909 --> 00:22:20,270
that things have changed a lot the

525
00:22:17,899 --> 00:22:22,489
change was directly proportional to the

526
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:26,418
newness of the sites we were trying to

527
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:29,000
address the ones that are mature assets

528
00:22:26,419 --> 00:22:32,179
those which were commissioned in 2000's

529
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,669
where we couldn't do much so we have

530
00:22:32,179 --> 00:22:37,279
more detective and deterrent ways of

531
00:22:34,669 --> 00:22:38,450
protecting after we've given awareness

532
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:40,399
that you know something wrong can happen

533
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:43,490
and for the new sites which were

534
00:22:40,399 --> 00:22:45,110
commissioned after 2010 because the

535
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:47,779
systems that they were used were

536
00:22:45,110 --> 00:22:51,889
relatively new and ot in ot area ten

537
00:22:47,779 --> 00:22:55,220
years is like mint condition so we have

538
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:57,529
we were able to put in reasonably high

539
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:00,350
level of controls and on those locations

540
00:22:57,529 --> 00:23:03,950
we've been able to even set up concepts

541
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:05,809
like DMZ access controls we've been able

542
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:09,049
to do all of it just because of the

543
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:10,668
newness again I'll admit that and now we

544
00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:13,309
have certain policies and procedures

545
00:23:10,669 --> 00:23:16,940
that are their first cut was more like

546
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:20,840
an IT policy such control fi t control

547
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:23,799
vo t we did that but then after that we

548
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:26,840
realized that that's not the method so

549
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:28,250
after that it's been all you know we've

550
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:30,199
been able to mature in terms of

551
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:33,020
processes if you'll ask me where are we

552
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,580
if I had to rate from one to five we

553
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:38,870
started off with the two we would be

554
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:40,428
somewhere at 33.5 we're not there but we

555
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:42,889
will be because we know where we have to

556
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:44,840
go again so in in the OT most of the

557
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:48,470
technology is actually built and

558
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:50,389
developed by OEMs correct so let me ask

559
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:52,280
you this why does the industry not ask

560
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:55,400
for security by design built into the

561
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:57,350
product okay from day one

562
00:23:55,400 --> 00:24:00,020
so I don't know how many of you are

563
00:23:57,350 --> 00:24:01,459
aware but from the ot space you would be

564
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:04,430
there is an open process automation

565
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:05,690
forum that's there yeah but that's

566
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:08,360
playing catch-up you know that

567
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:10,460
ha ha ha it may take time in fact they

568
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,919
are trying to rely on 6 2 4 4 3 as a

569
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,260
standard but then 6 2 4 4 3 has a

570
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:19,040
forever bit under publish so for a lot

571
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:23,090
of them so but still if you ask me that

572
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:25,309
you know can we push the OEMs a kind a

573
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:28,220
body like a no path open process

574
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:30,620
automation folks can actually push for

575
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,540
that because every time we have to go

576
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:34,580
back to the OEMs and mind you we are not

577
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:36,500
the ones who got their services in so we

578
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:38,540
are not the influencers anyway from the

579
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,670
cyber security standpoint so we formed a

580
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:42,800
committee only to deal with the OEMs and

581
00:24:40,670 --> 00:24:44,540
ask for certain controls why not

582
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,889
why aren't you not influencing the

583
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,030
procurement decision because that's

584
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:49,059
where you make the decisions around

585
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:52,399
security but today with regards to OT

586
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:54,530
it's it's somebody somewhere else who

587
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,090
has made that decision five years back

588
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:58,370
that you know this is how we will go

589
00:24:56,090 --> 00:25:00,678
with this plant and then you know we've

590
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:01,969
invested so much so in in our case if it

591
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:04,010
were a firewall when they're acting

592
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:05,390
unruly we'll just throw the firewall how

593
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:07,520
are you going to take yoga out of a

594
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:10,100
system if it weren't listening to you

595
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,220
you can't do that so we have to coexist

596
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:15,169
in some way so we put more data and

597
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,760
controls other than getting the OMS to

598
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:18,770
do a lot of stuff I think I think what

599
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:21,110
you're saying is you have a point there

600
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:23,360
but there is there's a pace at which the

601
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:25,250
industry also functions and we can push

602
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:27,649
it to certain level and I think the ask

603
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:30,020
is there from us to the vendors and the

604
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:32,120
vendors are putting in efforts but the

605
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:35,210
cycle there is not as quick as an IT

606
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:37,040
cyclist as he said in 10 years you still

607
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:39,530
feel it's mint condition so I would

608
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,330
believe that the efforts are there from

609
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:43,129
both the parties and we are getting

610
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:45,020
there that's that's something which I

611
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:47,660
would want to believe yeah just to add

612
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:51,170
on to what he was saying that I've been

613
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:53,350
lately meeting a lot of CIOs CEOs from

614
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:55,160
the OT side as well as the ID side so

615
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:57,469
there are a lot of critical

616
00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:00,230
infrastructures manufacturing and all

617
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:02,090
these people that have already met there

618
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:05,030
is one thing that that is one thing

619
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:07,610
which was in common was all the OT

620
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:08,750
networks were completely isolated right

621
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:10,729
so and that is

622
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:12,730
exactly what they thought that security

623
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:15,770
is even you might have a fancy

624
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:18,590
designation but you would you would also

625
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:21,620
not have an access to it completely but

626
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:24,649
things are fast rapidly changing and

627
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:26,899
CIOs are are seriously looking into or

628
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:28,640
not running the business the same way

629
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,200
how traditionally it's been running and

630
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:33,170
the regulations or the Indian

631
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,420
regulations are also picking mine I mean

632
00:26:33,170 --> 00:26:37,370
little stringent I would say in in terms

633
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:39,320
of bringing everything on board

634
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:42,830
I think CI o--'s are working towards it

635
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:45,250
I think it's not a very long base that

636
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:47,810
you have to pass to reach there I think

637
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:51,380
I would support what you're saying so I

638
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:54,409
think if you look at from the core IT

639
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:56,000
systems perspective also about it's only

640
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:57,740
about three or four maybe five years ago

641
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,330
where people realize ok security by

642
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:01,190
design has to be there previously by

643
00:26:59,330 --> 00:27:02,899
design has to be there and it took a

644
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:04,790
while about you know 30 to 14 years it

645
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,800
took there with OD I think the awareness

646
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:09,050
is increasing and because we have the

647
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:12,139
use cases established with owed IT I

648
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:15,260
think I think it would be much quicker

649
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:17,180
than how it happened in in IT but I

650
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:19,700
think there's a lot of pushback that

651
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:22,970
comes in and many times I think oi'm say

652
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:25,130
that it's very native to us you know the

653
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:27,650
knowledge about this is not available in

654
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:29,870
the market so attack vector or effort is

655
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:32,090
is not as much as it would be there in

656
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:34,699
the IT system etc but I think we'll get

657
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:36,620
there as what I'm getting a sense from

658
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,780
and I know for the fact that all

659
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:40,250
communities are pushing towards that

660
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:42,020
nobody wants to be in the newspaper for

661
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:45,110
the wrong reasons next day yeah I think

662
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:46,270
I think I'd support that yeah you had a

663
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:50,260
question

664
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:55,790
[Music]

665
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:58,879
gentlemen they blew in my chair yeah I

666
00:27:55,790 --> 00:28:01,310
just like to make a one point and then a

667
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,490
last question also what I see

668
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:07,730
basically I come from G General Electric

669
00:28:04,490 --> 00:28:10,730
so we do use a lot of OT infrastructure

670
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:14,000
we are the OEM as well for many of the

671
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:16,540
OT fetchers so I actually I actually

672
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,110
ought to talk about that

673
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:22,659
my I just want to I just want to respond

674
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:25,090
and to this group also that there is a

675
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:28,090
lit there is a huge push from the OM

676
00:28:25,090 --> 00:28:32,320
site as well now earlier the devices

677
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:34,929
used to come with no authentication at

678
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,530
all now at least they are written to the

679
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,530
basic authentication

680
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:44,919
so what happens here that that now

681
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:48,070
because the demand is there that's why

682
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:51,670
om has to change and there is always

683
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:53,530
thread that repetition of a such om will

684
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:55,600
always be questioned because some

685
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:57,010
equipment will go to somebody's hand and

686
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,780
they will show it in deaf corner

687
00:28:57,010 --> 00:29:01,780
somewhere that disease equipment is

688
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:04,210
faulty and you are able to get the data

689
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:06,510
or whatever so those kind of things are

690
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:09,280
changing the question what I actually

691
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:11,620
wanted to ask that when you do a risk

692
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:14,470
assessment in your organization for

693
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:17,590
example if you're using ot do you

694
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:22,570
consider the public safety as a aspect

695
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:25,540
for example what I my perspective ot

696
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:29,200
most authorities are used in a public

697
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:30,909
safety kind of conditions so in a normal

698
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:33,010
risk assessment scenario we will

699
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:34,990
consider CIA which is confidentially

700
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:37,030
integrating availability but there is a

701
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:39,490
one more dimension get added is a public

702
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:42,399
safety which is a bigger dimension than

703
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:44,470
the CIA at dimension as well so I mean

704
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,090
is there any effort has been done or

705
00:29:44,470 --> 00:29:48,850
haven't just for your pockets I mean I

706
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:51,399
think that's a great question and if I I

707
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:52,929
would recall last year again when we

708
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,450
were around the same time the same panel

709
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:57,820
this did come up and we can do that that

710
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:59,590
in addition to security previously

711
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:02,409
safety response must be considered when

712
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:06,100
dealing with IOT or ot for both because

713
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:08,410
it is applicable both places yeah but so

714
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,850
Anson straight answer to that is yes let

715
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:11,770
me just go across to these gentlemen to

716
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:13,659
you know find out straight away from

717
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:15,879
them whether they have already included

718
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:17,740
their in there is versus middle law it's

719
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,840
interesting you asked because like I

720
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:23,230
mentioned I was last week at the site

721
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,909
just the week that's gone by and one of

722
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:26,590
the things that I picked up this time

723
00:30:24,910 --> 00:30:28,060
was rather than calling every times I

724
00:30:26,590 --> 00:30:30,020
have a security information security I I

725
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:32,030
called out a few times I was if

726
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:36,860
because that had them catching attention

727
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:38,510
and one of yeah so in a few a few weeks

728
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:41,449
back I was there somewhere attending a

729
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:43,160
training and then the trainer there said

730
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:45,470
that you know one question to ask the

731
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:47,540
folks out there is in how many ways can

732
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:49,520
you kill people with this system then

733
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:51,290
their mind gets reeling that you know

734
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,270
what can we really do over this system

735
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:56,270
and then what is to be done to block

736
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:58,250
those from happening so cyber safety is

737
00:30:56,270 --> 00:31:01,340
something that we can push has a term

738
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:03,170
and we were trying to because you have

739
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:05,090
to tell those folks that not only can

740
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:07,940
you bring out oil but you can kill

741
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:09,530
system hence human asset which is the

742
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:12,140
most important asset around this place

743
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:13,940
should be equally protected yeah I mean

744
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,600
just look at the example connected cars

745
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,010
right

746
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:19,428
the steering wheel is no longer in your

747
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:21,200
control accelerator is just you know in

748
00:31:19,429 --> 00:31:22,790
somebody else's control you wouldn't

749
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,320
bother about security there you wouldn't

750
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:24,860
bother about previously there what we

751
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,750
would bother

752
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:29,059
immediately about is your safety right

753
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:31,160
same thing if your variable devices

754
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:32,990
right your vitals are being captured in

755
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,380
you know by the doctor and pretty base

756
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:37,880
is that he's prescribing certain

757
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:40,010
medicines to you if the vitals are going

758
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:42,020
wrong it's a straightaway health risk or

759
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:45,080
health hazard right so yes that indeed

760
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:47,330
becomes in addition to traditional

761
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:49,820
security and privacy risk the safety

762
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:51,620
risk which will come and start becoming

763
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:54,350
more and more prevalent as the adoption

764
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:58,580
of IOT and ot you know goes or goes more

765
00:31:54,350 --> 00:32:05,689
and more I said I offered you can come

766
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:09,379
and sit here used in most of the smart

767
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:13,280
lighting or medical baby monitors or

768
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:15,500
even in industrial things also and that

769
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:18,500
protocol is twenty five or thirty year

770
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:21,260
old and it is used widely because it's

771
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:23,870
cheap it is a no authentication it is

772
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:26,030
not encrypted traffic everything is

773
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:27,709
whatever you like to call in the

774
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:29,510
security space that is not there

775
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:31,970
actually completely in but that is a

776
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:34,190
widely used and everybody is using it

777
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:36,470
that's where the most scary thing that

778
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:38,570
okay somebody now the next attack will

779
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:38,809
need not be on an IT or anything like

780
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:40,520
that

781
00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:43,490
somebody will attack the lighting of a

782
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:45,289
city or somebody we attack the name

783
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:47,149
that's what he was referring to when he

784
00:32:45,289 --> 00:32:55,840
said that and that's that's exactly his

785
00:32:47,149 --> 00:32:58,039
point was I come from and yes so it is

786
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:03,529
yeah in this country we call it Ram Peru

787
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:06,379
say you know I come from an organization

788
00:33:03,529 --> 00:33:08,330
which is called a shell and safety human

789
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:11,720
safety is of paramount importance for us

790
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:16,879
I mean yeah they just didn't want to

791
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:19,940
hear me so I think human anyone who's

792
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:22,340
visited our facility goro his team who

793
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:25,490
they would actually concur to what I'm

794
00:33:22,340 --> 00:33:27,918
saying and we I told in my previous you

795
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:30,260
know answer that we weren't allowed to

796
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:32,059
touch the PCD domain for a while because

797
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:34,309
they didn't know that what can kill a

798
00:33:32,059 --> 00:33:36,620
human being because these are old like

799
00:33:34,309 --> 00:33:38,120
ZigBee is there you don't know what you

800
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,439
do and do not know what is the

801
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:40,939
repercussion over somewhere else so

802
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,320
that's that's the reason why you want to

803
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:44,510
curtail the environment you want to

804
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:48,320
quarantine it first and test it and I

805
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:50,809
think no company let it be OEM let it be

806
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,879
the user or whoever does not want this

807
00:33:50,809 --> 00:33:54,408
blood to go in there in as a newspaper

808
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:57,169
on them and no one wants to take it in

809
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:58,700
as a human as well so I think that is of

810
00:33:57,169 --> 00:34:00,380
paramount importance for everyone when

811
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:10,250
it comes to it specially the IOT and ot

812
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:12,379
you you had a question we all know that

813
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:14,830
I t is absolutely matured I mean it is

814
00:34:12,379 --> 00:34:17,210
way beyond the maturity level InfoSec is

815
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:20,199
definitely there's enough I was

816
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:23,089
sufficient if people use tell me

817
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:24,618
yeah but lot of disrupt introduction of

818
00:34:23,089 --> 00:34:26,599
disruptive technology is already kicked

819
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:30,020
in so from that perspective IT is quite

820
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:31,730
matured we have seen the the various

821
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:34,429
different phases of evolution InfoSec

822
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:36,349
also from the automation standpoint or

823
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:38,869
any other advancement of modernization

824
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:42,169
standpoint there are lot of enablement

825
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:43,970
or empowerment is given by the usage of

826
00:34:42,168 --> 00:34:45,799
various different form or certifications

827
00:34:43,969 --> 00:34:49,790
to enable people the community and all

828
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:52,010
so is it something on in ot like you

829
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:55,129
know we have basic certifications like

830
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:57,170
in an IT bee-eater network platform

831
00:34:55,129 --> 00:34:59,690
storage database so any

832
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:02,839
decided and same in a cybersecurity also

833
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:04,670
beat an operation side or development

834
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:07,250
side of forensic or any other thing so

835
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:09,079
this is in similar to this line do we

836
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,579
have the introduced like one of the

837
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:13,779
forum what you just mention about some

838
00:35:10,579 --> 00:35:16,010
open open forum so some standardized

839
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:18,380
certifications for the community so that

840
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:20,539
we get enabled through those

841
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:23,359
certification and then interest can also

842
00:35:20,539 --> 00:35:25,579
equally gradually can you know step up

843
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:28,190
and then awareness can be created in the

844
00:35:25,579 --> 00:35:31,069
ecosystem so on the same line I have a

845
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:33,380
question to any one of you if you can

846
00:35:31,069 --> 00:35:35,799
throw some light on that so on IIT there

847
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:38,510
is a lot of consortiums which have got

848
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:41,180
cansada globally as well as at local

849
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:42,349
level and those are the those are the

850
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,210
bodies which are trying to spread

851
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:46,160
awareness and then through the social

852
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:48,380
media by you know holding multiple

853
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,779
campaigns and by reading the chapters

854
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:52,760
etc that is happening an IOT and which

855
00:35:50,779 --> 00:35:55,849
which i think is happening more than OT

856
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:58,819
these days and again i think it was not

857
00:35:55,849 --> 00:36:03,019
at the same point that ot is still kind

858
00:35:58,819 --> 00:36:06,319
of a very closed community as opposed to

859
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:09,279
io T's your usage and and its perceived

860
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:13,269
it as a bleep Elizabeth per say Venus

861
00:36:09,279 --> 00:36:16,339
but having said that in OT also I think

862
00:36:13,269 --> 00:36:17,990
this sans if I know they were coming out

863
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:19,970
with some certification it's raining

864
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:21,828
also they have caught and I think that

865
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:23,660
could be a good start point if somebody

866
00:36:21,829 --> 00:36:25,490
wants to yeah if somebody wants to

867
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:26,779
establish you know more credentials

868
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:29,629
around there and kept or awareness

869
00:36:26,779 --> 00:36:33,680
around yeah but you know my take on that

870
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:36,890
is the seesaw was probably one of the

871
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:38,750
earliest movers in the IT space and then

872
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:41,269
I see Square chemin with she came in

873
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:43,369
with cissp here and suddenly a year down

874
00:36:41,269 --> 00:36:45,618
the line you saw a barrage of that

875
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:47,119
coming in I feel like what do I do with

876
00:36:45,619 --> 00:36:48,650
in people but like I do this

877
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,299
certification this certification and

878
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:54,440
then started climbing up so I think

879
00:36:50,299 --> 00:36:55,460
certifications are good but for me

880
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:58,339
personally I think they have lost

881
00:36:55,460 --> 00:37:00,140
relevance at some point in time you you

882
00:36:58,339 --> 00:37:01,880
give any certification to our people

883
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:03,170
here they will crack it in no time and

884
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,910
they would want to then there will be

885
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:06,349
expectations that I have scored better

886
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:08,660
so I need to get a better pay or a

887
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:10,170
better job that should not be the idea

888
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:12,359
so the I think it's a

889
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:13,829
way to restart the mist to relearn from

890
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:15,328
the mistakes what we have done and do a

891
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:17,339
better job there from a certification

892
00:37:15,329 --> 00:37:18,990
perspective so there is there are talks

893
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:21,058
happening there are trainings which are

894
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:23,009
for sure there but if you're talking an

895
00:37:21,059 --> 00:37:24,630
industry party certification I think if

896
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:26,279
the industry is somewhere working and if

897
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:27,869
you have influence on them you should

898
00:37:26,279 --> 00:37:30,119
talk in these terms

899
00:37:27,869 --> 00:37:32,130
yeah I think I will agree with what

900
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:34,289
Secession just mentioned I think with

901
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:36,089
these consortium chapters industry god

902
00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:37,410
is talking about it more and more I

903
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:39,509
think buzz would creator which is

904
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:42,058
important creation of the bus is very

905
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:43,680
very important but then the purpose of

906
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:45,750
certification determining the purpose

907
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,519
certificate is very important to why do

908
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:49,950
I want to have a certification we know a

909
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:51,868
lot of cases where people just go see it

910
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:53,788
certified easy counts as he has

911
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:55,890
certified or some some backing

912
00:37:53,789 --> 00:37:58,920
certification etc they have obtained but

913
00:37:55,890 --> 00:38:01,170
then when it comes to really you know

914
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,420
doing the job which is required do they

915
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:05,279
have it in them so determining the

916
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:07,619
purpose of certification is very

917
00:38:05,279 --> 00:38:09,779
important it is only for enhancing the

918
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:11,640
resume or enhancing the skill set

919
00:38:09,779 --> 00:38:14,250
thereby contributing in a better way to

920
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:19,230
these cyber fertility so that I think is

921
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:22,380
very important all right so thank you so

922
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:24,690
we heard about you know the from soft

923
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:26,849
resources the expectation is not to know

924
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:28,829
about ot and IT security because these

925
00:38:26,849 --> 00:38:30,329
two are two different landscapes we also

926
00:38:28,829 --> 00:38:32,150
heard about the convergence model that

927
00:38:30,329 --> 00:38:35,519
we are on the verge of you know

928
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:37,019
incorporating so when if the convergence

929
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:39,149
will happen and we have a connected

930
00:38:37,019 --> 00:38:41,519
network how a sock analyst will you know

931
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:44,220
identify cases like lateral movement

932
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:45,450
from IT 202 euro t2i t if sock and this

933
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:48,149
don't have a feasibility on both

934
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:49,710
platforms in my view I believe this is

935
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:51,630
the time where we should not just scale

936
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:53,369
in terms of our technology but we should

937
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:55,200
also converge at the people and process

938
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:57,150
both I think you have answered yourself

939
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,439
I friends understand the question yeah

940
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:59,849
and that's the reason I'll Stanley I am

941
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:02,609
sitting here with idea norisse what is

942
00:38:59,849 --> 00:39:05,400
both know so I think yes that when the

943
00:39:02,609 --> 00:39:07,859
conversion the the the consolidation

944
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:10,049
happens that you would have technologies

945
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:11,430
which will addresses both these and they

946
00:39:10,049 --> 00:39:13,759
would become please good invest in

947
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:16,879
people to get this done so very

948
00:39:13,759 --> 00:39:18,109
important we can't ignore it

949
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:20,839
you've anomaly when you talk about

950
00:39:18,109 --> 00:39:25,400
security as a portfolio it's a very

951
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:29,420
niche area you know so so it's it's very

952
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:31,069
difficult to get people who with with

953
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:34,190
these kind of skill sets that's why it's

954
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:36,079
very niche you know so and this is this

955
00:39:34,190 --> 00:39:38,569
is a gray area and this is not being

956
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,460
here like it's not it's a global problem

957
00:39:38,569 --> 00:39:43,160
it's not only in India it's it's a

958
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:45,799
global problem and attrition in these

959
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:48,859
areas are pretty high because there is a

960
00:39:45,799 --> 00:39:51,859
need always so they will be developer

961
00:39:48,859 --> 00:39:54,229
they will be lot of technologies which

962
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:56,390
is coming in later date I mean in the

963
00:39:54,229 --> 00:39:58,339
last discussion that we say today we are

964
00:39:56,390 --> 00:40:01,368
talking about shock I mean the era of

965
00:39:58,339 --> 00:40:03,769
last era it was only not right it was

966
00:40:01,369 --> 00:40:05,839
not then it became shock now it's it's

967
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:08,660
it's all about going into threat hunting

968
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:11,420
in data lake and all this stuff so the I

969
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:13,549
mean this this is an evolving area right

970
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:14,450
all these years we were talking about

971
00:40:13,549 --> 00:40:15,979
prevention

972
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:18,200
now suddenly detection has come up

973
00:40:15,979 --> 00:40:19,759
machine learning is coming up artificial

974
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,578
intelligence is coming up and how many

975
00:40:19,759 --> 00:40:24,650
skill sets do we have today where we can

976
00:40:22,579 --> 00:40:26,630
go ahead and hire people I I come from a

977
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:28,279
security organization and I hire people

978
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:30,710
left right and center and I understand

979
00:40:28,279 --> 00:40:33,259
what is the difficulty the CIOs and CTOs

980
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:36,559
can go across in getting the right skill

981
00:40:33,259 --> 00:40:39,109
set to manage but but you also need to

982
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:41,380
understand this business which is to run

983
00:40:39,109 --> 00:40:45,019
your supporting arm so you can't

984
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:46,969
infinite infinitely invest on people or

985
00:40:45,019 --> 00:40:49,008
technology or something to go ahead and

986
00:40:46,969 --> 00:40:50,569
ahead and ahead and never get you know

987
00:40:49,009 --> 00:40:51,979
it's a never ending story so you need to

988
00:40:50,569 --> 00:40:54,890
have a trade off somewhere all right

989
00:40:51,979 --> 00:40:57,319
just just one point we keep hopping on

990
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:59,118
about CIA but actually if you take a

991
00:40:57,319 --> 00:41:02,690
step back most of you know it covered is

992
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:05,239
right most people have been exposed to

993
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:07,849
Co but at some point yes anyone who

994
00:41:05,239 --> 00:41:08,779
doesn't know all right how many of you

995
00:41:07,849 --> 00:41:10,279
actually understand what is the

996
00:41:08,779 --> 00:41:12,799
information criteria information

997
00:41:10,279 --> 00:41:15,499
principles of covered yeah

998
00:41:12,799 --> 00:41:19,880
do those principles only cover CIA or

999
00:41:15,499 --> 00:41:21,288
not much more much much more that's

1000
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:24,950
where the problem lies everyone's focus

1001
00:41:21,289 --> 00:41:27,200
is on the CIA so for your point when we

1002
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:28,669
started this in shell 20 years ago we

1003
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:30,470
started the information principles not

1004
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:32,630
CIA that's why we looked at ot

1005
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:36,040
that is the fundamental shift in how we

1006
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:38,869
looked at the problem we were hacking ot

1007
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:40,640
first based on those principles then

1008
00:41:38,869 --> 00:41:43,880
based on CI a and you don't always have

1009
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:45,560
to test to understand the when you apply

1010
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:47,359
information spins principles from an

1011
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,910
audit perspective remember you always

1012
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:53,299
start with design have I designed

1013
00:41:49,910 --> 00:41:55,700
security into my solution if the design

1014
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:58,670
is wrong or it's incomplete in line with

1015
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:01,490
us principles right you don't even have

1016
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:03,380
to taste the Potter was hilarious is

1017
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:04,669
when we started to ask some very basic

1018
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:08,089
questions around those information

1019
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:10,010
principles to the OEM vendors they were

1020
00:42:08,089 --> 00:42:11,660
flawed because they hadn't thought

1021
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:13,069
through the information principles as

1022
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:14,420
the starting point of how they designed

1023
00:42:13,069 --> 00:42:15,589
the solution that's why I didn't even

1024
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:17,390
have to teach to know that there was a

1025
00:42:15,589 --> 00:42:19,400
problem do you understand the predator

1026
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:21,529
issue which is so I think you're right

1027
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:23,990
there and the OEMs would not because

1028
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:26,060
that was not there the security was not

1029
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:28,250
there but perogative at that point in

1030
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:30,049
time we bought in in so I think what he

1031
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:31,819
said and you bought in aspects to it

1032
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:34,490
which I think now they're thinking about

1033
00:42:31,819 --> 00:42:36,529
talking about and they're only really

1034
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:37,098
started when the four majors got

1035
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:39,380
together

1036
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:42,109
Exxon Shell thought ow got together and

1037
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:43,970
said we want this yeah I mean that's a

1038
00:42:42,109 --> 00:42:46,670
story that have positive parts always be

1039
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:48,290
the trend I mean come together and then

1040
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:50,089
foam and then start driving them that's

1041
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:52,069
that's that's always been the trend and

1042
00:42:50,089 --> 00:42:53,270
I think security by design as you

1043
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:55,190
mentioned I think you were emphasizing

1044
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:57,349
on that point I think that is a point

1045
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:59,000
that to be driven home by each one of us

1046
00:42:57,349 --> 00:43:02,180
here the security by design has to be

1047
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:04,910
there in the in the equipment and has to

1048
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:06,710
be applied by OEM Stan yeah you're

1049
00:43:04,910 --> 00:43:08,140
saying something wrong the point is it

1050
00:43:06,710 --> 00:43:10,849
doesn't matter what the technology is

1051
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:12,529
today it may be Audi tomorrow be machine

1052
00:43:10,849 --> 00:43:13,970
learning are absolutely the principles

1053
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:16,010
don't change irrespective of the

1054
00:43:13,970 --> 00:43:18,529
technology so if you go back to first

1055
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:21,079
principles you have to go back to first

1056
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:22,880
principles absolutely can evaluate the

1057
00:43:21,079 --> 00:43:24,109
technology from a risk perspective then

1058
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:25,910
you can have the right conversation

1059
00:43:24,109 --> 00:43:29,140
right absolutely right any other

1060
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:29,140
question from the audience

1061
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:35,750
[Music]

1062
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:48,690
from the goatee perspective RV focusing

1063
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:50,280
on other areas like or you see some use

1064
00:43:48,690 --> 00:43:52,800
cases like health care which is like

1065
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:54,120
Public Safety right so health care is

1066
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,130
one of the most important so I just took

1067
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:58,440
the baton from his hand and throwing I

1068
00:43:56,130 --> 00:44:00,540
mean asking question more on a public

1069
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:03,570
safety site by covering the health and

1070
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:05,550
care domain or the natural disasters

1071
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:07,830
which happens the country's specific

1072
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:09,090
because that's the biggest danger you

1073
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:15,060
are there in the session yesterday as

1074
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:17,700
well in the same place I guess so health

1075
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:19,799
take from the device

1076
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:21,480
I'm variable perspective and all the

1077
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:23,190
equipment which are being used advanced

1078
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,950
equipment which have been used in the

1079
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:29,280
hospitals and the healthcare systems

1080
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:33,810
health care organizations so I think

1081
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:35,130
they have taken an advanced sleep one of

1082
00:44:33,810 --> 00:44:37,740
the reasons for that I would like to

1083
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:39,060
believe is the regulation yeah because

1084
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:40,799
because they are in more regulated

1085
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:42,240
industry as opposed to maybe you know

1086
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,190
other critical infrastructure that we

1087
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,689
just referred to which is where I think

1088
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:47,970
they have taken an advanced leap as

1089
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:49,530
opposed to others and and there are

1090
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:51,959
privacy by design and security by design

1091
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:53,940
principles already being applied by some

1092
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:56,430
of them I know but that more work is

1093
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:58,320
required to be done still and and and I

1094
00:44:56,430 --> 00:45:00,839
think it is ongoing story it is ongoing

1095
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:02,820
it has it has to continue continual

1096
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,440
continue it's not that you have done is

1097
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:07,230
one time and it is it is done forever

1098
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:09,240
but yes in the health take that work is

1099
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:11,070
already is is happening by some of the

1100
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:13,259
large ones the smaller ones has still

1101
00:45:11,070 --> 00:45:15,270
maybe catching up but that started SPD

1102
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:18,270
and pre VD both has started there were

1103
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:19,890
you also talking about variables was

1104
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:21,990
your question more around variables as

1105
00:45:19,890 --> 00:45:24,390
well yeah not variables the different

1106
00:45:21,990 --> 00:45:26,879
verticals like as we talked about the en

1107
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:28,589
you or the health care so the focus is

1108
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,900
required equally on other segments like

1109
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:33,450
health and care health care or the

1110
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:35,190
transportation side OS the public safety

1111
00:45:33,450 --> 00:45:36,899
side yes absolutely

1112
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:39,390
I think we did mention we did touch upon

1113
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:41,220
a couple of use cases of Public Safety

1114
00:45:39,390 --> 00:45:44,140
in the transfer a transportation when we

1115
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:45,910
did mentioned about the GPS or they may

1116
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:48,069
hacking it's exactly so that's where it

1117
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:49,870
comes in in the autumn of business he

1118
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:51,730
also said that we look at the basics of

1119
00:45:49,870 --> 00:46:13,420
security it's not about an industry at

1120
00:45:51,730 --> 00:46:16,030
the end of it I think this is just he

1121
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:18,160
telecoms when we switch from 3G to 4G

1122
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:19,600
right that became obvious you could not

1123
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,430
survive this you fix the security in

1124
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:23,980
telecoms yeah was one yeah you same

1125
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:25,600
thing same story okay it just happened

1126
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:27,250
different points in time because the

1127
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:29,049
technology see the mentally opened up

1128
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:31,480
technology the minute you started using

1129
00:46:29,050 --> 00:46:33,520
IP technologies and this is where the

1130
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:36,190
brain issue these in the industry flips

1131
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:38,320
to tcp/ip you see have to address the

1132
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:40,210
security exactly because you can now log

1133
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,860
argue that you cannot have security

1134
00:46:40,210 --> 00:46:43,060
through obscurity right you know I have

1135
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:45,040
to understand the principles of the

1136
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:47,950
technology that using an Inca through it

1137
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:50,710
not all of our industries one by one by

1138
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:52,509
one has slowly been switching okay in

1139
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:55,240
terms of the technologies they using why

1140
00:46:52,510 --> 00:46:57,370
because everyone wants connectivity yes

1141
00:46:55,240 --> 00:47:00,729
the connectivity is what's driving the

1142
00:46:57,370 --> 00:47:01,990
threat the threat landscape right if you

1143
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:03,130
understand that it doesn't matter what

1144
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:05,259
industry you're going through you have

1145
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:06,940
to understand what's triggering the the

1146
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:09,130
paradigm shift on security front and

1147
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:10,690
it's twofold one is the design for

1148
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:12,460
connectivity and even for the OEMs

1149
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:15,100
what's happening with the OEMs they've

1150
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:17,530
been pushed to give more connectivity to

1151
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:19,480
the equipment absolutely the Melissa

1152
00:47:17,530 --> 00:47:20,890
missionaries the minute they do that

1153
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:24,160
they're using tcp/ip because that's a

1154
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:26,109
low-cost solution yeah yeah the minute

1155
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:28,509
they use a tcp/ip you have the fact in

1156
00:47:26,110 --> 00:47:30,100
the negatives of that that's what's

1157
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:32,290
driving a lot of this conversation now

1158
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:33,880
whether that's oil and gas whether that

1159
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:36,520
was automatically had the same debates

1160
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:38,680
on SCADA the same issues on SCADA same

1161
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:41,200
and PLC and same in PLC conversation

1162
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:42,790
here okay you're gonna see now in the

1163
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,930
building management the automation

1164
00:47:42,790 --> 00:47:46,000
systems are and all the management the

1165
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:48,490
BMA systems right same problem the

1166
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:51,100
protocols are completely insecure okay

1167
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:52,899
so it's slowly changing the difference

1168
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:56,170
is the speed of which industry is

1169
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:56,980
actually moving in a direction yes for

1170
00:47:56,170 --> 00:47:59,200
oil

1171
00:47:56,980 --> 00:48:01,600
yes for example it may be too late I

1172
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:04,960
tell you why a refinery lasts twenty

1173
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:06,670
twenty-nine years okay so if the OEMs

1174
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:09,040
don't actually push the change fast

1175
00:48:06,670 --> 00:48:12,400
enough those refineries will get shut

1176
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:14,109
down that's right yeah - like you're

1177
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,450
gonna live with an ability for twenty

1178
00:48:14,109 --> 00:48:19,779
right right he just referred to Telecom

1179
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:22,450
so if you notice in India we witness 3G

1180
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:24,400
4G you know very recently right and then

1181
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:27,310
I don't know how many of you have got

1182
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,990
exposure telecom in 2011 Department of

1183
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:31,150
Telecom had the first time released the

1184
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:33,310
license the security conditions as part

1185
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:36,430
of the UAS as their licensing right and

1186
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:38,170
that's where there was scramble him in

1187
00:48:36,430 --> 00:48:39,910
the entire telecom industry that okay we

1188
00:48:38,170 --> 00:48:42,430
have to satisfy these security

1189
00:48:39,910 --> 00:48:45,368
conditions for code core network also

1190
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:46,660
right but then look at it that from 2011

1191
00:48:45,369 --> 00:48:49,359
till now there has been some major

1192
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:52,270
changes and then with and right now if

1193
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:54,069
you go and ask the telecom OMS or the

1194
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:57,160
operators they are much more relieved

1195
00:48:54,070 --> 00:49:00,070
reason is this that most of their

1196
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:01,839
equipment are now IP enabled right so

1197
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:04,180
they know okay while the threats can be

1198
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:06,280
identified much faster well nobody can

1199
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:07,710
be identified much faster it provides me

1200
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:10,150
an opportunity to plant them also

1201
00:49:07,710 --> 00:49:11,530
earlier they did not know where the

1202
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:13,420
threats live where the velocities are

1203
00:49:11,530 --> 00:49:14,410
how to fix them which is where everybody

1204
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,430
was struggling and the lot of

1205
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:17,230
conversations were happening with the

1206
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:19,509
regulators at that point in time and the

1207
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:21,310
CEO AI and then all the bodies also have

1208
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:23,700
been stepping in that point in time but

1209
00:49:21,310 --> 00:49:26,200
I think I think fundamental lies

1210
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:29,589
regardless to these type of industry is

1211
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:30,250
whether you are doing the principles in

1212
00:49:29,590 --> 00:49:31,900
the right manner

1213
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:34,540
identifying the risk management risk

1214
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:36,100
prints risk areas in the right manner

1215
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:38,770
and then apply these strategies around

1216
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:41,109
it from the design still not at the much

1217
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:42,670
later you have some so that's a good

1218
00:49:41,109 --> 00:49:45,100
point or another small thing that you

1219
00:49:42,670 --> 00:49:47,230
say that regularization side so for the

1220
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:49,779
be FSA RBI is there but won't any

1221
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:52,510
concept like you talk about the d-o-t or

1222
00:49:49,780 --> 00:49:54,580
try or any other governing body so do

1223
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:58,030
they also follow so aggressively the way

1224
00:49:54,580 --> 00:50:00,910
RBI does the audit or the regularization

1225
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:03,210
for boy at the be FSI segment oh yeah

1226
00:50:00,910 --> 00:50:06,368
telecom so is there anybody from telecom

1227
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:07,840
ask him there are penalties there

1228
00:50:06,369 --> 00:50:10,060
penalties if they don't meet the

1229
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:12,070
conditions there penalties

1230
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:14,620
it's not only a telecom just to add to

1231
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:16,660
that it is not only telecom like I said

1232
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:19,540
in the earlier session where I was

1233
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:22,450
sitting here only and I said as per the

1234
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:26,980
IT Act there is an IT Act in India idea

1235
00:50:22,450 --> 00:50:29,500
mm if you don't have reasonable security

1236
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:34,180
practices for personal sensitive data

1237
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:36,130
then them there can be compensations and

1238
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:38,680
penalties and liabilities on you it is

1239
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:40,780
minimum micros which goes to light the

1240
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:42,549
adjudicator of the state maximum we

1241
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:44,680
don't know it has incident this so there

1242
00:50:42,550 --> 00:50:47,260
are lot of laws which are in place but

1243
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:49,450
what I just wanted to start off the

1244
00:50:47,260 --> 00:50:52,930
question was you know the problem with

1245
00:50:49,450 --> 00:50:55,810
our TCP like communication the challenge

1246
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:58,149
is that we do not have a system to

1247
00:50:55,810 --> 00:51:00,700
identify where the data comes in in the

1248
00:50:58,150 --> 00:51:03,040
form of a packet we don't identify you

1249
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:05,609
not able to identify we do that identity

1250
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:08,350
later on maybe at the application layer

1251
00:51:05,610 --> 00:51:10,750
stooling or maybe a firewall or whatever

1252
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:13,029
comes later on you know what if we can

1253
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:15,430
build a identity that the network and

1254
00:51:13,030 --> 00:51:17,800
the transport layer and only allow those

1255
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:23,589
packets which are identified otherwise

1256
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:26,320
you drop the packets I think we do have

1257
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:28,300
technologies in that space that's

1258
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:32,310
happening may not be you know I don't

1259
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:32,310
know if you have not seen that happening

1260
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:42,640
layer 2 and there it is every offers we

1261
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:45,340
have transport layer referring to a

1262
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:47,109
physical layer transport and station and

1263
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:51,700
also there is application layer by

1264
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:53,770
application formulas then what we saying

1265
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:55,990
is zero trust policy don't trust

1266
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:59,590
anything add identity at that layer

1267
00:51:55,990 --> 00:52:01,870
actress pen security Allah is yes that's

1268
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:04,440
how it happens yes sorry I'm being asked

1269
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:07,240
by these people that I have to wrap up

1270
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:08,920
he has come to me twice indicating from

1271
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:12,009
there it's been a very interactive

1272
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:14,620
session thank you very much if you still

1273
00:52:12,010 --> 00:52:18,160
have a question panel is around rooh is

1274
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:20,170
around too so feel free to get in touch

1275
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:21,328
with them and you can also tweet your

1276
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:23,489
question with

1277
00:52:21,329 --> 00:52:27,059
stack Deloitte at närcon you'll get the

1278
00:52:23,489 --> 00:52:29,609
response there now just to conclude I

1279
00:52:27,059 --> 00:52:32,309
think three or four takeaways one is

1280
00:52:29,609 --> 00:52:34,288
security by design do things right at

1281
00:52:32,309 --> 00:52:36,119
the beginning regardless to which

1282
00:52:34,289 --> 00:52:39,209
industry which I am which which

1283
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:41,519
technology second is the culture has to

1284
00:52:39,209 --> 00:52:43,469
be build that culture has to be build

1285
00:52:41,519 --> 00:52:46,919
sensitivity has to be coming in the

1286
00:52:43,469 --> 00:52:49,469
third thing is which I am borrowing the

1287
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:52,259
term from come--the he mentioned the

1288
00:52:49,469 --> 00:52:55,229
common criteria of risk identification

1289
00:52:52,259 --> 00:52:57,749
and common set of language or common

1290
00:52:55,229 --> 00:52:59,848
standard across whether it is IT IOT or

1291
00:52:57,749 --> 00:53:03,299
wherever it is and the last one is

1292
00:52:59,849 --> 00:53:05,160
setting that tone at the top I think

1293
00:53:03,299 --> 00:53:08,190
those are the four takeaways that I have

1294
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:11,299
and as I said feel free to get in touch

1295
00:53:08,190 --> 00:53:19,069
with the panelists and before they rise

1296
00:53:11,299 --> 00:53:19,069
just give it them a huge round thank you
